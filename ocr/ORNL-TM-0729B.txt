1.2 Design considerations. This section discusses the
considerations which influenced the design, particularly
those which are unique or are peculiar to the MSRE.

1.3 Plant instrumentation layout. This section de-
scribes the physical layout of the instrumentation
system, gives a general description of the overall layout
(Sect. 1.3.1), and then describes each area separately.
The instrument systems are located by area, and the
routing and installation of their interconnections are
included. ' '

1.4 Plant control system. This section gives a broad,
all-inclusive picture of the entire MSRE instrumentation

and control system, including control of auxiliary

equipment and the instrument power system. The
“mode control” used to guide reactor operation is
discussed with diagrams which define (or give) the
cenditions for the various modes (prefill, operate-start,
operate-run). The intent of this section is to outline the
main subsystems and not to dig into fine structure. The
reader is referred to Sects. 2 to 7 for details.

1.5 Safety system. This section discusses the safety-
grade instrumentation and controls associated with the
MSRE safety system. The discussion includes general
design criteria (designer’s guidelines) illustrated by a
typical system. The entire safety system, what it does,
and why, are tabulated and diagrammed.

2. Safety Instrumentation and Reactor Control

2.1 Nuclear instrumentation. The instrumentation in
the neutron channel up to, but not including, the panel
electronics is described. The neutron penetration, in-
cluding the guide tube assembly, is described, and the

2.8 Load control system. This section describes in
considerable detail the control of the equipment which
determines the reactor load, namely: radiator, radiator
doors, blowers, and bypass damper.

2.9 Health physics monitoring. This section describes
the health physics instrumentation and includes a
general description of the individual types of instru-
ments used plus a description of their interconnections
to form an integrated alarm system..-

2.10 Process radiation monitors. The components
and electronics used to monitor process lines carrying
helium, -water, off-gas, etc., are described. The oper-
ation of interlocks and alarms is covered in Sect. 4.

2.11 Stack monitoring system. This section describes
the radiation monitoring installed in the off-gas stack.
The components, how they function, and their purpose
are included in the discussion.

2.12 Data logger computer. This section gives a
general, broad description of the data system. Basic
capabilities, operations, and purpose of the logger
computer are described. (Note: The reader is referred to
 

 

 

manufacturers’ literature and the operations manual for
detailed information.)

2.13 Beryllium monitoring system. This section de-
scribes the system for monitoring beryllium con-

XV

centration at various points throughout the reactor
building and in the air discharged through the radiator
stack. This system is discussed further in Sect. 3.3.6.

PARTIIB

3. Process Instrumentation

This section provides a general description of the
instrumentation in the various systems. Included are
descriptions of major control loops with drawings of
individual control loops and their instrumentation. The
principles of operation of the various components and
most descriptions of control circuit operations are
discussed in other sections.® In general, sufficient
descriptive material, augmented by flowsheets and
diagrams, is included so that a reader with a reasonable
knowledge of instrumentation systems can determine

the arrangement and composition of the process instru-

mentation system.

4. Electrical Control and Alarm Circuits

4.1 General description. This section introduces in
very general terms the types of circuits to be found in
the MSRE system and how they are related. This text
material provides the background for succeeding sec-
tions (4.2 to 4.15).

4.2 to 4.10 Master control circuits, etc. These sec-
tions describe the electrical control circuits with engi-
neering elementary schematic circuit diagrams and,
where instructive, include the nonobvious interlock
functions and explain why they are required. The
material presented enables a person with a reasonable
knowledge of instrumentation and control systems to
understand the operation of the control circuits.

4.12 Annunciators. The annunciator system is de-
scribed, and considerations involved in the location of
annunciators are outlined. Schematics of the annun-
ciators used and their sequence of operation are
included. Their operational use is also discussed.

4.13 Instrument power distribution. This section
outlines the system which provides the MSRE instru-
mentation, control circuits, and annunciators with the
necessary power. Reliability considerations are in-
cluded.

3. PROCESS INSTRUMENTATION SUBSYSTEMS

3.1 FUEL SALT CIRCULATING SYSTEM

The process instrumentation for the fuel circulation
system is shown in Fig. 3.1.0. This system consists of
the reactor vessel, the fuel circulating pump and
overflow tank, the primary heat exchanger, and all fuel
salt piping interconnecting these components. All fuel-
containing are located inside the reactor containment
cell and are physically arranged to provide clear vertical
access for remote maintenance. The process variables
monitored in the fuel circulating system are:

. pressure,

. level,

. temperature,

.' helium flow,

cooling air, S

fuel pump motor parameters (speed current, power
mechanical noise),

7. radiation levels and control rod positions."

3.1.1 Pressure Measurements

There are four pressure-measuring elements in this
system: PT-522 and PT-592, which sense the fuel pump
bowl (system) pressure; PT-589, which senses the
overflow tank pressure; and PT-516, which senses the
pump shaft seal helium purge pressure. Details of the
process tie-in of PT-522 and PT-592 are shown in Fig.

3.1.1.0. Both of these pressure transmitters tie in to line -

592, which connects to the vapor space in the fuel
pump bowl. Line 592 also serves as a reference pressure

J. L. Redford

line for the level system described in Sect. 3.1.2. To
prevent backup of the highly radioactive pump bowl gas
in this line, the line is continuously purged with helium.
Several safeguards have been built into the system to
ensure containment of radioactive gases and/or prevent
back diffusion into operating areas through the purge
lines. In addition to the two check valves located inside

the containment enclosure, there is a solenoid valve -

which closes on loss of energizing voltage and which is
controlled by radiation detectors on the line. The
capillary flow restrictor, FE-592, serves the double duty
of ensuring a high-velocity flow region (to prevent any

possible back diffusion) and providing a pressure-

dropping element which allows a reasonable, qualitative
flow measurement by the use of a simple pressure gage
located between the restrictor and a throttling valve
HV-592B. Pressure switches mounted with the pressure

| ~ gage provide high and low alarm contacts which operate

an annunciator in the main control room. Line 592,
autoclave tubing, is doubly contained by running the

~ tubing inside a %-in. pipe from the pump bowl to the

instrument enclosure in the special equipment room.
From this point on, the autoclave tubing is not

contained, since the check valves and solenoid afford

reasonable protection.

The pressure transmitters are all-welded 0- to 50-psig
Foxboro Electric Consotrol instruments (see Sect. 6.1).
The low-pressure side of these transmitters is referenced
to the containment stack via a rolling diaphragm
reference chamber (see Sect. 6.2) which contains a
switch to sound an alarm in the control room if the
diaphragm is extended to its travel limit. This will occur

only if there is a rupture or leak in the sensing bellows

 
 

 

 

of the primary transmitter. The electric and pneumatic
portions of the PT-522 system are shown in Fig.
3.1.1.1. The elements in the 10 to 50 mA dc loop are
the 65-V power supply, the transmitter amplifier, a
precision 200-2 resistor, used to develop a 2- to 10-V
dc signal for the data logger, and a current-to-air
converter. These are discussed in Sect. 5.2.2.
. The current-to-air converter converts the 10- to 50-mA
dc signal to a 3 to 15-psig pneumatic signal which is
" transmitted to high- and low-pressure alarm switches
(PS-522A1 and A?2), three differential pressure modi-
fiers (P4M-1000A1, B1, and C1), control pressure switch
(PSS-522A), a recorder (PR-522), an indicator gage
(PI-522), and a pressure alarm switch (PS-522A3).

Pressure switches PS-522A1 and A2 operate main
board annunciators. Pressure switch PSS-522A is con-
nected in control circuit 129 and shuts off the shaft seal
purge flow when pump bowl pressure is high. The three
differential modifiers compare the pump bowl pressure
with pressures in the three drain tanks and transmit
pneumatic signals proportional to the differences in
these pressures to pressure switches P4SS-1000A1, Bi,
and C1 connected in control circuits 86, 87, and 88 (see
Sect. 4.3 and 4.10). The recorder (PR-522) is located
on the main control board. (The second pen of this
recorder is utilized for pump bowl level information.)
The indicator gage (PI-522) is located on the sampler-
enricher panel and is used to match sampler pressure
with pump bowl pressure when preparing to sample.
Alarm switch PS-522A3 is located in the sampler-
enricher area and operates an annunciator on the
sampler panel.

As originally installed, the conversion of the electrical
to pneumatic signal was also required to operate a
pneumatic control valve located in off-gas line 522
which controlled the pump bowl pressure. Deposits,
presumably originating from the fuel pump lubricant
plus carry-over of small amounts of fuel salt and fission
products, caused repeated plugging difficulties with this
valve. The amount of material causing the plugging was
not large, but, because of the low helium flow rate, 3.4
liters/min, the valve orifice (C, = 0.02) was, of
necessity, small and was therefore extremely susceptible
to plugging. Fortunately, operating experience showed
that pump bowl pressure fluctuations were extremely
slow and manually controllable, so this valve was
eliminated. Pump bowl pressure is now controlled
manually with hand valve HV-557B, located in the vent
house upstream from the charcoal traps.

The PT-592 signal system is shown in Fig. 3.1.1.2.
This system differs from that of PT-522 in that it
provides safety signals and has been installed in separate

conduits and is separated both mechanically and elec-
trically from its mating channel (PT-589). The primary
signal loop for PT-592 consists of a dual alarm switch
(see Sect. 5.2.2), which produces control action below
2 psig or above 25 psig, a 400-Q resistor, a 65-V dc
power supply, and a test switch. A second switch at the
sampler-enricher prevents sampling if the pressure is
greater than 10 psig. The test switch connects a variable
resistor in parallel with the torque motor of the
pressure transmitter. By manually varying the value of
this resistor, the output of the transmitter (the 10- to
50-mA signal) can be slowly increased to exceed the

“alarm trip point on the fuel switches, thereby testing

their operability. This operation tests the safety system
channel by artifically perturbing the torque motor in
the pressure transmitter (see Sect. 6.23). The only
untested element in the channel is the pressure sensing
bellows in the transmitter. The 400-£2 resistor is used to
develop a voltage sufficient to supply requirements of
the input of the isolation amplifier, which separates and
decouples the safety portion of the signal from the
control-grade portion. The output of the isolation
amplifier is also a 10- to 50-mA signal and is used to
operate an indicator, a high alarm switch, and to
provide a signal to the data logger. A 200-£ resistor
develops the signal voltage to the data logger which
provides additional indication and alarm. The PT-589
loop is identical to that of PT-592 except that its
process connection is a tie-in to the overflow tank
(which normally has free communication with the
pump bowl) rather than into the vapor space of the
pump bowl.

The PT-516 signal system is shown in Fig. 3.1.1.3.
This signal is developed by a weld-sealed O to 50-psig
Foxboro pressure transmitter identical to those pre-
viously described in Sect. 3.1.1. The transmitter is
referenced to atmospheric pressure through a rolling
diaphragm reference chamber. The 10- to 50-mA signal
is recorded in the auxiliary control room and converted
to a voltage signal which is sent to-the data logger. This
pressure indication is used by the operator to maintain
the helium shaft seal purge pressure greater than the
pump bowl pressure, thereby ensuring downward flow
through the seal. There are no alarms or automatic
control action associated with this signal. Purge flow
control in line 516 is discussed in Sect. 3.1.4.

3.1.2 Level Measurements

There are four level measurements made of two
process variables: salt level in the pump bowl and in the
overflow tank. Redundant measurements are made in
 

 

both places for increased reliability and, in the case of
the overflow tank, to satisfy the redundancy require-
ment of the safety system.

The pump bowl level measurement instrumentation is
diagrammed in Fig. 3.1.2.0. The technique is one used
extensively throughout industry. An open-ended tube,
the dip tube, is immersed in the fluid to a depth below
the lowest expected fluid level. The gas pressure
required to overcome the liquid head above the bottom
of the tube and produce a constant low rate of gas flow
through the tube (which bubbles into the gas space

- above the liquid surface) is a measure of the liquid level.

Temperature-induced density changes in the pump bowl
salt during normal operation are slight, so that measure-
ment accuracy is virtually unaffected by temperature
variations (other effects on density are negligible). The
dip tubes are staggered in depth of submersion. There-
fore, the pressure difference in the two dip tubes gives
some indication of the fluid density. These level

measurements are made with weld-sealed differential -

pressure transmitters (see Sect. 6.3), which measure the
difference between the helium pressures in the different
tubes and in the gas spaces above the salt surface in the
pump bowl and overflow tank. The transmitter output

is a 10- to 50-mA dc electrical signal. These transmitters

are located in a containment enclosure in the special
equipment room. The helium purge is provided in an
identical manner as the purge for PT-522 (see Sect.
3.1.1). The solenoid valves are of the all-welded type
described in Sect. 6.20 and are used to equalize
pressures between the dip tube and reference lines and
to block purge flow through selected lines on operator
request or in the event of high radiation. Equalizing
provides a known signal for checking the zero calibra-
tion of the differential pressure transmitters.

Since the fuel salt has such a high freezing tempera-
ture, a heated surge volume was provided on each dip

leg in the fuel pump bowl. Being physically located in

the gas space of the pump bowl, the surge volume
remains at pump bowl gas temperature. Its volume is

approximately ten times the volume of the purge line

between the check valves and the pump bowl,; so that
no salt will back up into the line and freeze during the
worst credible pressure transient in the fuel system.

The electronic Consotrol instrumentation (ECI) (10-

to S0-mA) signals from the pump bowl level trans-

mitters (LT-593 and LT-596) are passed through 200-£2

resistors to develop 2- to 10-V signals for the data
logger and are then converted to pneumatic pressure .

signals with Foxboro current-to-air> converters. The
pneumatic signals so obtained are switched by solenoid
valves, so that either can serve as input to the recorder

 

in the control room and to control switches which
provide high and low alarms and prevent operation of -
the fuel pump under low salt level conditions. The
switching circuits are described in Sect. 4.9.8. An
indicator, operated by each signal, is located in the
transmitter room. |

Since the fuel system can be filled with either fuel or
flush salts and since there is a difference in density of
the two salts, provisions have been made to remotely
and automatically change the span of the two fuel
pump bowl bubbler differential pressure transmitters,
LT-593 and LT-596, so that correct level is indicated by
the readout device regardless of which salt is in the
circulating system. This is accomplished by altering the
feedback gain and zero current of LT-593 and LT-596
as described. in Sect. 6.23. Further discussion of the
level system is presented in Sect. 6.8.

The overflow tank level measurement system is
diagrammed in Fig. 3.1.2.1. Since there is usually very
little salt in the overflow tank, no provisions for a surge
volume were made in this instance.

The ECI (10- to 50-mA current) signals from the
overflow tank level transmitters (LT-599 and LT-600)
are both considered process safety signals and are
treated accordingly. Safety system requirements are
described in Sect. 1.2.3, Part IIA of this report. The
level transmitters are located inside a containment
enclosure in the special equipment room. The trans-
mitter amplifiers, switches, and isolation amplifier are
all located in auxiliary board No. 8 in the auxiliary
control room. An in-service testing system consisting of
a variable resistor, which can be manually paralleled
with the torque motor of the level transmitter, provides
a method of ensuring that the switches are operating at
the correct set point and that the system is capable of
producing an output of sufficient magnitude to actuate
the switches.

The safety switches associated with these channels are
utilized to actuate an alarm in the main control room
and to initiate an emergency fuel drain in the event of
high level in the overflow tank.

Included in the current loop is a 400-§2 resistor and
an associated current-to-current converter which pro-

vides a secondary isolated current loop for indicators in

the auxiliary control room and the transmitter room
and a 2- to 10-V signal (developed across a precision
200-§2 resistor) for the data logger input.

Solenoid valves, check valves, and helium purge flow
restrictors, are provided. Their action is identical with
those for the pump bowl level transmitters. ,

A level measurement is also made of the oil level in
the oil catch tank which traps any oil which might be

 
 

 

 

 

 

carried over in the upper gas seal leakage gas stream.
This measurement is made by use of a weld-sealed
differential pressure transmitter (LT-524), whose out-
put operates a switch (LS-524C) and an indicator
(LI-524C) on the auxiliary control board and also
develops a signal for the data logger across a 200-Q
precision resistor. The switch is used to operate an
alarm lamp in the main control room on high level (see
Fig. 3.1.0). The oil catch tank is located in the special
equipment room and can be drained of any accumu-
lated oil during times when the reactor is subcritical.

3.1.3 Fuel System Temperatures

Most temperatures in the fuel system are measured by
means of groundedjunction %-in.-OD Inconel-
sheathed, magnesium oxide-insulated Chromel-Alumel
thermocouples which are Heliarc welded to pads on the
vessels and piping (see Sect. 6.7). Exceptions to this are

the ungrounded junction thermocouples on line 103 .

(which is a resistance-heated line) and the Y% 4-in.-OD
individually sheathed Chromel and Alumel wires uti-
lized for the safety thermocouples.

Figure 3.1.3.0 shows a typical (control-grade) thermo-
couple system. In general, there is at least one thermo-
couple on the piping at each heater location in the
system. Additional thermocouples are located at pipe
supports and at any other region whose temperature
might be expected to deviate from the average system
piping temperature.* Most of these temperatures are
routed via the thermocouple patch panel to either the
temperature scanner (Sect. 6.14) or the data logger.

The temperature measurements which require special
readouts or treatment are:

1. safety system,

2. freeze flanges,

3. control rod servo input,
4.

freeze valve.

A typical safety-grade thermocouple system is shown
in Fig. 3.1.3.1. The safety thermocouples are indi-
vidually sheathed wires, individually attached to line
100 near the pump bowl. Individual wires were chosen
for this application so that detachment of the wire from
the piping would be detectable by the open circuit
burnout feature of the emf-to-current converter. Lo-
cated in the safety panel and connected in series with

 

*All thermocouples are listed by number in the MSRE Reactor

and, where applicable, the patch panel terminal assignment.

the safety thermocouple is a second thermocouple
which can be heated in order to test the system.
without disconnecting or otherwise disturbing the

“safety circuitry. The two series thermocouples provide

an imput signal to a Foxboro emf-to-current converter
(see Sect. 5.2.2) whose current output operates a dual
switch. Contacts on these switches actuate the fuel drain
demand circuits, a high-temperature alarm in the
control room, a high-temperature reverse to insert all
rods, and a high-temperature scram to drop all rods.
The fuel drain demand circuits are described in Sect. 4.7.
The reverse contacts are connected in a two-out-of-
three coincidence arrangement in circuit 207 as shown
in Fig. 4.1.19. The scram contacts are also connected in
a two-out-of-three arrangement in the nuclear safety
system (see Sect. 4.5). Each current loop contains a
400-82 resistor and associated isolation amplifier whose
output is used for a temperature indication in the safety
panel and to develop the 2- to 10-V signal, required for
the data logger, across a 200-§2 resistor.

A typical freeze flange thermocouple system is shown
in Fig. 3.1.3.2. Six thermocouples are installed on each
freeze flange. Three are connected to the data logger;
two are connected to Electra Systems switches (see
Sect. 6.15), which alarm and operate lamps on the
graphic display panel, indicating out-of-limits tempera-
ture (high or low); and the remaining thermocouple is
utilized for occasional readout only. _ ‘

The temperature measuring system used for the
control rod servo system is shown in Fig. 3.1.3.3. Each
thermocouple is connected to a Foxboro emf-to-current
converter whose output (10- to 50-mA} in turn operates
a recorder on the main board and supplies an input to
the control rod servo system when the servo is in the
temperature mode. _

The temperature measuring and control system used
for freeze valve FV-103 is shown in Fig 3.1.3.4.
Thermocouples mounted on the freeze valve are used to
operate six Electra Systems switches, two points on a
multipoint recorder, and a Foxboro emf-to-current
converter. The converter output is used to develop a 2-
to 10-V signal for the data logger and to operate a
Foxboro current-to-air converter whose output is fed to
a pneumatic controller which controls the air to valve
HCV-919A1, which, in turn, controls the cooling air to
the freeze valve. Since it is imperative that freeze valve
103 be able to thaw regardless of the state of
containment, special restrictor valves were installed
between the supply and vent sides of HCV-919A1 and
919B1, so that these valves could close (shutting off
cooling air to freeze valve 103) regardless of the
position of the block valves. Valves HCV-919A2 and
 

HCV-919B2 are operated by the freeze valve control
circuits discussed in Sect. 4.3,

3.1.4 Helium Purges

There are seven helium purges supplied to the primary
reactor system. Six of these are the bubbler and
reference line supplies for the fuel pump bowl level and
overflow tank level measurements and amount to
approximately 2 liters of helium per minute (at 25 psig)
total for the bubblers. The other supply is the purge for
the lower gas seal in the pump bearings, most of which
ends up in the pump bowl. The flow measuring system
for the gas seal flow in line 516, shown in Fig. 3.1.4.0,
uses a matrix-type flow element (see Sect. 6.19). The
pressure drop across the matrix is approximately 40 in.
‘H, 0 with a 300-liters-per-hour helium flow and varies
directly with flow. This pressure drop is measured with
a seal-welded Foxboro differential pressure transmitter
with 3- to 15-psig air output (see Sect. 6.3). The 3- to
15-psig pneumatic signal from the transmitter supplies a
strain gage transducer (Sect. 5.3.1) whose 0- to 10-mV
output goes to the data logger, a switch which alarms in
the control room on low flow, and a Foxboro indica-
tor/controller (Sect. 5.3.1) which is used to control the
purge flow via valve FCV-516. A solenoid valve in the
control valve supply line prevents the valve from
opening if the pump bowl pressure ‘is m excess of 20
psig.

The only helium flow that is measured as it leaves the
pump bowl is the upper-gas-seal leakage from the pump
bearing (see Fig. 3.1.0). This flow is sensed by a
matrix-type flow element (FE-524) which provides a
pressure drop of approximately O to 40 in. H,O for a
helium flow of 0 to 4.5 standard liters per hour. A
seal-welded Foxboro electric differential pressure trans-
mitter (Sect. 6.3) placed across the taps of this matrix
transmits a 10- to 50-mA dc signal which is propor-
tional to the flow in line 524. This signal is then
indicated and alarmed in the main control room and, by
use of a 200-L resistor, sent to the data logger. -

The main off-gas line from the pump bowl (lme 522)
has no flow-measuring sensors.

A second use of the helium purge (through the

bubbler dip tubes) to the overflow tank is to provide a-
means of pressurizing the tank to push any salt that has
accumulated there back to the pump bowl. A manually
operated pneumatic valve (HCV-523) in the gas vent

from the overflow tank is closed, allowing the helium

purge to build up sufficient pressure to lift the salt back

to the pump bowl. The air supply line to the valve is
normally left- in a capped position, unless a burp is in

 

progress, to ensure - that HCV—S23 is not inadvertently
closed. :

3.1.5 Component Cooling Air

Several of the components in the reactor system
require cooling in order to maintain reasonable temper-
atures. The air is supplied from a component cooling
pump located in the special equipment room which
recirculates the cell air. Air flow to the individual

- components is controlled by means of individual

manually controlled air-operated throttling valves which
are located in the reactor cell. Since the reactor cell is

 maintained at a negative pressure of approximately 2

psig, the reference side of all valves is referenced to the
stack suction rather than to the cell in order to prevent
changes in valve position from occurring as the cell
pressure is varied. Components which receive cooling air
in this fashion are the rod drive assemblies, the reactor
neck, freeze valve 103, and the fuel circulating pump.

. The pressure drop across each of the valves supplying

this cooling is maintained constant by PCV-960, which
is described in Sect. 3.6.1.

The quantity of cooling air flowing to the fuel pump
bowl (line 903) is controlled by throttling valve
HCV-903 and is sensed by means of an orifice in the
line upstream of the throttling valve (see Fig. 3.1.0). A
pneumatic differential pressure transmitter (FT-903B),
located in the transmitter room, provides a signal to an
indicator (FI-903B) in the transmitter room. No auto-
matic control or alarm action is taken from this
parameter. Valve HCV-903 is manually positioned by
means of a loading station, integral with FI-903B,
which supplies air to the valve operator througha 2 to 1
booster relay, FM-903A.

A rather unique use of the cooling air to the control
rod thimbles is the fiducial zero rod position indicator
(see Sect. 2.7.2 in Part IIA of this report). This system
consists of a pneumatic bridge assembly, one element of
which is an orifice located near the lower limit position
of the rod. As the rod passes through this orifice a
change in differential pressure, sensed by a differential
pressure transmitter (ZT-987A), is obtained. Manually
operated valves HSV’s 986, 987, and 988, located in the
transmitter room, are utilized to select which rod is to
be checked. Output of the transmitter is indicated on a
receiver gage (ZI-987A) which is also located in the
transmitter room. '

3.1.6 Fuel Pump Motor Parameters

The fuel pump motor parameters, such as speed,

current, voltage, power, and bearing noises, are indi-

 
 

 

 

cated in the main control room. These signals are also
sent to the data logging system and, in the case of speed
and current, sent to the control circuits.

The speed indicating system (Sect. 6.16) is a dual
track system, each track consisting of a magnetic-type

speed pickup, FP-E!l or E2, which delivers a pulse

output as each tooth of a gear attached to the pump
motor shaft passes it. Pickup FP-E3 is an installed spare.
The gear used contains 60 teeth, so the resulting output
of the speed pickup is one pulse per second per
revolution per minute. This pulse output is utilized to
drive a digital counter in the main control room and a
pulse count-rate meter (SIT-FP-E1 or E2) in the
transmitter room. Electronically controlled relays in the
count-rate meter provide contacts which are used to
actuate low-speed alarms and to disable the reactor fill
permit and run mode circuits on low pump speed. A
low-level dc signal from the count-rate meter is used to
provide a speed signal to the data logger and a meter
readout in the main control room.

Voltage and power measurements are made by use of
current and potential transformers EiE-Fp-D1 and D2
and EvE-Fp-D1 and D2 in the pump motor leads
outside the containment. The secondary windings of
these transformers are connected to an ammeter (Eil-
FP-D), wattmeter (Ewl-FP-D), and watt converter
(EwM-FP-D) in the main control room and to a watt
recorder (EwR-FP-D) in the transmitter room. The
signal from the converter is sent to the data logger.

Three additional current transformers (EiE-FP-G1,
G2, and G3) supply three currents (one for each motor
lead), each of which operates a pair of relays. These
relays are utilized in the nuclear safety system to
automatically increase the sensitivity of the safety flux
measurement by a factor of 1000 in the event of high
or low current to the pump motor. This system is
explained in more detail in Sect. 2.5, Part IIA of this
report.

The sensors (X ,-FP-F1 and F2) used for noise
pickup are high-temperature ceramic microphones
(Sect. 6.17) which, with the coolant pump micro-
phones, are connected to an audio amplifier and
speaker system in the auxiliary control room. No
automatic action is taken from these noise measure-
ments. |

3.1.7 Radiation and Control Rods

The radiation monitoring systems consist of two
wide-range counting channels, a BF; counting channel,
three safety channels, two linear channels, and three
ambient gamma leve! channels. There are three control

rods in the reactor which are used for shutdown margin
when inserted and as temperature controllers when
withdrawn. These systems and their operation are fully
covered in Part I1A of this report, Sects. 2.3 and 2.7.

3.2 FUEL SALT DRAIN AND FILL SYSTEM

The fuel salt drain and fill system is shown in Fig.
3.2.0. This system consists of a fuel flush tank, two fuel
drain tanks and their associated steam domes, the fill
piping and freeze valves, and the drain tank pressur-
ization system which is utilized to fill the reactor
system. All components are arranged for clear vertical
access for maintenance purposes. '

The process variables monitored in the fill and drain
system are:

pressure,
level,

weight,

. temperature,

T

. radiation.

3.2.1 Pressure

The system for pressurizing the drain tanks is shown
in Fig. 3.2.1. Helium from the cover gas system (at 40
psig) enters through a capillary flow restrictor (FE-517)
which limits the maximum rate of pressurization of the
drain tank system. A weld-sealed 0- to 50-psig pressure
transmitter (PT-517) senses the pressure in line 517.
This transmitter is located outside the biological shield-
ing in the electrical service area, and its associated
amplifier is located in the transmitter room. In this
application the transmitter bellows is, in itself, part of
secondary containment; it is not connected to a rolling
diaphragm reference chamber. The output current of
this transmitter (10 to 50 mA dc) passes through a
200-Q2 resistor, to develop a 2- to 10-V signal for the
data logger, and a current-to-air transducer whose 3- to
15-psig pneumatic output is the input to an indicator/
controller on the main board in the control room. The
output of the controller operates a weld-sealed control
valve, PCV-517. Solenoid valve HCV-517 closes or
prevents the operator from opening PCV-517 if the
helium pressure drops below 28 psig or if an emergency
fuel drain is requested. When HCV-517 is energized,
PCV-517 controls the pressure in line 517 to the value
manually set into the indicator/controller. The helium
supply to line 517 is common to both drain tanks and
to the flush tank. Since the control scheme for all drain
 

 

 

 

tanks is identical, only the flush tank control scheme
will be discussed.

HCV-576Al is a weld-sealed pneumatically operated
on-off valve located in the north electric service area. It
is controlled by a solenoid valve which prevents the
pneumatic valve from opening except when filling the
system from or when transferring to or from the flush
tank. Two check valves downstream of HCV-576Al
serve as additional isolation of the drain tank from the
cover gas system and, together with HCV-576Al,
prevent the escape of radioactive gases and/or particu-
lates through line 576. The two check valves, a pressure
transmitter (PT-576), and a manually operated block
valve are located in an instrument enclosure in the
north electric service area. The pressure sensor is a
weld-sealed O- to 50-psig ECI transmitter which is used
to indicate the flush tank pressure at all times. The
reference side of the pressure transmitter is referenced
to the containment stack by means of a rolling
diaphragm reference chamber. The transmitter and
reference chamber system are the same as described in
Sect. 3.1.1 for PT-522. The output current of the
transmitter (10 to 50 mA dc) passes through a 200-Q2
resistor, which develops a 2- to 10-V signal for the data
logger, and a current-to-air transducer. The pneumatic
output of the current-to-air transducer (3 to 15 psig)
operates four pressure switches used for high and low
alarm and control functions and also operates recorder
PR-576 on the main control board.

A small helium purge stream is provided through lines
519, 553, and 555 to prevent back diffusion of
radioactive gas from the flush tank to PT-576 when
HCV-576Al is closed. As these lines bypass valves
PCV-517 and HCV-576Al, they offer a possible path for
escape of radioactivity and are therefore a part of the
containment system. Weld-sealed -solenoid - valves
ESV-519A and ESV-519B serve as redundant block
valves and are operated by the containment safety
control circuits so that the same containment safety
interlocks that close PCV-517 and HCV-576Al also
close ESV-519A and ESV-519B. The capillary re-
strictors determine the purge flow rate and, because of
the higher gas velocity in the capillaries, also serve to
prevent back diffusion of radioactivity into line 553.

The tank may be vented to either the off-gas system,
through vent valve HCV-577Al, or to the pump bowl,
through equalizer valve HCV-546Al1. HCV-577Al and

HCV-546Al are pneumatically operated weld-sealed

on-off valves. Both valves are located inside the drain
tank cell. The reference side of the valve operators of
both valves is vented to the containment air exhaust
stack rather than to cell atmosphere so that changes in

drain tank cell pressure will not affect the requested
position of these valves. Block valves in the air supply
and vent lines close on high drain tank cell pressure.
Position switches mounted on the valves indicate, in the
control room, the condition of the valve. In the case of
valve HCV-546Al, the position switch indicates when
the valve is more than 50% open since this valve must
be open for an orderly drain of the system. In all other
cases the valve position switches are adjusted to indicate
when the valve is fully closed. The valves are operated
by solenoid valves HCV-564A2 and HCV-577A2 which
are in turn operated by the control circuits (see Sect.
4.2.4). They may be manually operated, subject to
control circuit restrictions, by switches located on the
main control board.

3.2.2 Salt Inventory

The inventory of salt in the two fuel drain tanks and
the fuel flush tank is sensed by two independent means.
The first is a conductance-type probe (Sect. 6.10) used
as a single-point high- and low-level sensor. This
instrument gives a high and a low lamp indication in the
control room and in the transmitter room. There is no
control action associated with the single-point level
system. These probes are identified as LE-FD1A and -B,
LE-FD2A and B, and LE-FFTA and B in Fig. 3.2.0.

The second system involves the use of a pair of
pneumatic weigh cells (Sect. 6.6) supporting each tank.
Figure 3.2.2 shows a weigh system which is typical for
all tanks. The tare signal for the weigh cells is provided
from pressure regulators on the weigh cell control
panels located in the transmitter room. The tare signal
is read on a 100-in. mercury manometer in the
transmitter room and is referenced to the drain tank
cell so that changes in cell ambient pressure will not
affect the live reading. Pneumatic switching allows the
use of the same manometer for indication of the tare
signal of all weigh cells. The live signal from each of the
weigh cells is indicated on a second 100-in. manometer
with similar switching, also located 'in the transmitter
room. The live signal is then reduced in amplitude from
a nominal 3- to 45-psig signal to a 3- to 15-psig signal.
The two 3- to 15-psig signals are then averaged to give a
single 3- to 15-psig signal which is proportional to the
total live weight of a given tank. This average signal is

“recorded in the main control room and converted to a
- 0- to 10-mV dc electric signal by means of a strain gage

transducer. The millivolt signal is sent to the data
logger. A pneumatic controller with zero proportional
band integral with the weight recorder acts as a
front-adjustable pneumatic low-level switch. The 3- to
 

 

15-psig signal from this switch operates a pressure
switch which in turn actuates an annunciator in the
main control room. To meet containment criteria, each
of the pneumatic lines to the weigh cells contains a
block valve which closes on high drain tank cell
pressure. '

The levels in the two fuel drain tank steam domes
(which provide cooling for after-heat removal from the
fuel salt) are measured by 0- to 20-in. H,O-range
electric differential-pressure transmitters (LT-806A and
LT-807A). These transmitters are located in the north
electric service area, and their amplifiers (LM-807A1
and LM-807A2) are located in the transmitter room.
The 10- to S50-mA outputs from the transmitter
amplifiers are converted to 3- to 15-psig pneumatic
signals in the transmitter room. The pneumatic signals
are transmitted to indicator controllers (LIC-806A and
LIC-807A) which are located on the main control
board. The output from the controller is used to
control a throttling valve in the water supply line which
feeds the steam dome to control the water level in the
dome (see Sect. 3.8.2). There is no logging or alarm
taken on this parameter.

3.2.3 Temperature

Temperatures are measured in this system in a manner
similar to that in the reactor cell, that is, all thermo-
couples are attached to weld pads on the piping or
components, and the lead wires are routed, via multiple
quick disconnects, through the containment enclosure
in pressurizable sealed cables to the thermocouple patch
panel and pyrometer panel in the control room to be
scanned, recorded, or logged on the data logger (see
Sects. 3.1.3and 6.7).

The control scheme for freeze valves 104, 105, and
106 is the same as for freeze valve 103 (see Sect.
3.1.3.4), except that, since the freeze valve for the
selected drain tank is kept thawed while salt is in the
reactor, a redundant shutoff valve in the cooling air
supply line is not required.

In order to obtain a better indication of the tempera-
tures in the drain tanks, a special probe with five pairs
of thermocouples equally spaced along its length was
installed in the tank. (see Sect. 6.7.2 and Fig. 6.7.3).
This probe is not influenced by the external heaters
which surround the side walls of the tank. The lowest
thermocouples in the probe operate Electra Systems
switches and initiate automatic filling of the steam
dome with water in the event of excessively high salt
temperature in the drain tank.

3.2.4 Radiation

There are three high-level gamma chambers located in
the drain tank cell to monitor ambient gamma level.
The current from these chambers is read out on a single
electrometer in the auxiliary control room. Each
gamma chamber in the reactor cell or drain tank is
manually selectable for readout. There is no alarm or
control function associated with this ambient cell
activity measurement. Further discussion of these moni-
tors is presented in Sect. 2.10, Part IIA of this report.

3.2.5 Fuel Loading and Storage

The fuel loading and storage system is shown in Fig.
3.2.3. This system includes the transfer freeze valves
and piping, the fuel storage tank, and the fuel loading
station and interfaces with the fuel processing system
discussed in Sect. 3.12. The fuel storage tank serves as
both a storage reservoir during loading operations and
as an active component in the fuel processing system. It
also provides an alternate location for long-term or
emergency storage of fuel salt. The design of instru-
mentation and controls for this tank was therefore
required to be compatible with both the reactor and the
fuel processing systems.

Except for radiation, the process variables monitored

in the fuel loading and storage system are the same as in

the fuel salt fill and drain system.

3.2.5.1 Temperature. All temperature measurements
in the fuel loading and storage system are made with
Y-in-OD Inconel-sheathed, MgO-insulated Chromel-
Alumel thermocouples. Measurements are made on the
surfaces of lines 107, 108, 109, 110, and 111; freeze
valves 107, 108, 109, and 110; and on the surface of
the fuel storage tank. These thermocouples are shown
in Fig. 3.13.3 and are listed in the MSRE Reactor
Process System Thermocouple Tabulation (ORNL Dwg.
A-AA-B-40511). Freeze valves 107, 108, and 109, lines
107, 108, and 109, and part of line 110 are located in
the drain cell. Thermocouples on these components
were installed and routed in the same manner as those

~in the reactor cell (see Sects. 3.1.3 and 6.7). The

remainder of the components in the fuel loading and
storage system are located in the fuel processing cell.
Thermocouples on these components are installed and
routed in the same manner as those in the coolant salt
circulating system (see Sects. 3.3.3 and 6.7). All
thermocouples are routed to the patch panel in the
auxiliary control room for further distribution via the
pyrometer panel to indicators, switches, scanner, or

logger.
 

-

The temperatures of freeze valves 107, 108, 109, 110,
and 111 are monitored and controlled in a manner
similar to that of freeze valve FV-103 (see Sect.
3.1.3.4), the difference being in the control from the
center thermocouple. Since these valves are either deep
frozen or thawed, there is no need for proportional
control of the center temperature. The cooling air
supply for freeze valves FV-107, 108, and 109 is
supplied by the component coolant pump since these
valves and lines are inside of the fuel drain tank cell.
The cooling air supply for freeze valves FV-110, 111,
and 112 is supplied by the component coolant pump
(which also -supplies the freeze valves in the coolant
system). The pressure output of the pump is controlled
by a vent valve which bypasses a portion of the pump
output to atmosphere. An alternate supply of cooling
air is the service air compressor whose output is further
regulated by -a self-contained line-mounted high-
capacity pressure regulator.

-3.2.5.2 Salt inventory. The inventory of salt in the

fuel storage tank is sensed by twe independent means.
The first is a weigh system, identical to the weigh

system for the fuel drain tanks (see Sect. 3.2.2), whose’

output is recorded at the chemical processing panel in
the high bay main control room and on the data logger.
The second system utilizes an ultrasonic level probe (see
Sect. 6.11) which performs the same function as the

conductivity level probes used in the drain tanks (see’

Sect. 3.2.2). The ultrasonic probe was necessitated in
this case because of the corrosion rates expected in the
fuel storage tank which were much higher than in the
other drain tanks and was therefore not compatible
with the thin wall construction of the conductivity
probes. The ultrasonic probe, which operates indicator
lamps in the transmitter room and main control room,
is relatively insensitive to corrosion effects.

3.2.5.3 Pressure. Measurement and control of pres-
sure in the fuel storage tank are dxscussed in Sect
3.13.5.1.

3.2.5.4 Fuel loading station. The fuel loading station
is the same as the one used for filling of the coolant

~system and consists of two salt cans inside of heated

furnaces. Pressurization of the gas space in the cans, by
means of helium pressure controlled by line regulators

PCV-611 and -612, pushes the salt out of the can and

into the system. Two thermocouples TE-SST-1 and
TE-SST 2 monitor the temperature in the salt cans.

3255 Fuel salt filter. Instrumentation and control'

of the fuel salt filter are discussed in Sect. 3.13.5.10.

3.3 COOLANT SALT CIRCULATING SYSTEM

The process instrumentation for the coolant salt
system is shown in Figs. 3.3.0 and 3.3.1. This system
consists of the coolant circulating pump; the radiator
(salt-to-air secondary heat exchanger) and its cooling
fans and drain (freeze) valves; and all coolant salt piping
interconnecting these components. All coolant salt
components are located in the coolant cell, which is
completely accessible when the reactor is subcritical for
any maintenance or repair.

The process variables monitored in the coolant system
are:

pressure,
level,

temperatnre,_

flow,

radiation,

coolant pump motor parameters,

beryllium concentration.

3.3.1 Pressure Measurements

The only pressure measurement made on the coolant
salt circulating system is that of the pump bowl cover
gas. This measurement is made indirectly on reference

~ pressure line 594, which is purged to minimize back

diffusion. The sensing pressure element PT-528A1 is a
0- to 50-psig Foxboro seal-welded electric pressure
transmitter (Sect. 6.1), which is referenced to coolant
cell ambient pressure. The 10- to 50-mA electric signal
from the transmitter is routed to the transmitter room
where it passes through a 200-82 resistor (PM-528A2) to
develop a 2- to 10-V signal for the data logger and is
converted to a 3- to 15-psig pneumatic signal by
current-to-air transducer . PM-528A3. The pneumatic
signal is transmitted to the main control room where it
serves as input to recorder-controller PRC-528A and
switches PS-528A1, PS-528A2, and PSS-528A. Two of
these switches operate a common (high-low) an-
nunciator on the main control board. The third is
interlocked in the control circuit (see Sect. 4.2.5).
PRC-528 controls a throttling valve located in the main
off-gas line from the coolant pump bow! which, in turn,

‘automatically regulates the coolant system over-

pressure. The throttling valve (PCV 528) is weld-sealed
(see Sect.-6.5).

 
 

 

 

3.3.2 Level

The salt level in the coolant pump bowl! is measured
by a bubbler system similar to that used on the fuel
pump. A pair of seal-welded electric differential pres-
sure transmitters (LT-595C and LT-598C) (see Sect.
6.3) sense the pressure differences between the dip
tubes and a reference and transmit 10- to 5S0-mA
electric signals proportional to the salt level to the
transmitter room where they are converted to 2- to
10-V signals for the data logger by resistors LM-595C2
and LM-598C2 and to 3- to 15-psig pneumatic signals
by converters LM-595C3 and LM-598C3. The pneu-
matic signal is indicated in the transmitter room on
board-mounted gages LI-595C and LI-598C. Solenoid
valve HCV-598C1 is used to select one of the signals for
recording, alarm, and control. The selected signal is
transmitted to recorder LR-595 and five switches in the
main control room. Switches LS-595C2 and C3 operate
a common (high-low) annunciator on the main control
board. Switches LS-595C1 and C4 and LSS-595C2 are
used as interlocks in the control circuits (see Sects.
4.2.3,4.2.4.1, and 4.2.4.2). The system for purging the
bubbler and reference lines is functionally identical to
that used for the fuel system bubblers; however, since
the coolant system is in itself secondary containment,
double containment of lines and components was not
required.

A third float-type level transmitter was also installed
on the coolant pump bowl (see Sect. 6.9). The output
of the ball float transmitter is an electric (1000 Hz)
signal which is detected, recorded, and converted to a 3-
to 15-psig pneumatic signal by an integral (Foxboro
Dynalog) recorder-converter (LR/LM-CP-A) located in
the transmitter room. The pneumatic signal is converted
to a 0- to 10-mV dc signal for the data logger by a strain
gage transducer (LM-CP-A2). Provisions were made to
permit selection of the pneumatic signal from the ball
float transmitter instead of the bubbler system signals
for transmission to the main board recording and
control devices discussed above. Since the ball float
transmitter was a developmental device installed pri-
marily for long-term proof testing, it has been used as a
backup system for the bubblers.

The level in the oil catch tank is sensed by a O- to
80-in. water weld-sealed electric differential pressure
transmitter (LT-526A). The 10- to 50-mA dc electric
signal from the transmitter operates an indicator
(LI-526A) and a switch in the auxiliary control room.
The switch contacts operate an indicator lamp on the
main control board. The transmitter output is also
converted to a 2- to 10-V signal for the data logger by
resistor LM-526A2.

3.3.3 Temperature

All coolant salt temperatures are measured by means
of '%-in-OD Inconel-sheathed magnesium oxide-
insulated Chromel-Alumel thermocouples which are
Heliarc welded to the surfaces of vessels and piping
except on the radiator tubing where a metal strap is
used in lieu of the Heliarc weld method of attachment.
There are approximately 300 thermocouples in the
coolant system. All coolant salt system thermocouples
(except those on the radiator) are terminated in single
Thermo Electric thermocouple disconnects. From this
disconnect, individual thermocouple extension wires are
routed to a junction box. All thermocouples from the
radiator are terminated directly in junction boxes; from
the junction boxes, all thermocouple lead wires are
routed to the thermocouple patch panel for further
distribution (see Sect. 6.7).

Exceptions to the above are three safety thermo-
couples (TE-202A1, Bl, and C1). Signals from these

sensors, in conjunction with coolant salt flow, are used:

to initiate closure (drop) of the salt-to-air radiator doors
and an emergency coolant drain in the event of low
radiator outlet temperature or low salt flow (see Sect.
2.8.6). The safety thermocouples are individually
sheathed Chromel-Alumel wires, attached and insuldted
in the same manner as the reactor outlet safety
thermocouples discussed in Sect. 3.1.3.1, so that the
instrument burnout feature can be utilized to detect
detachment of the hot junction from the piping which
would give false indication of pipe wall temperature. As
in the reactor outlet temperature safety system, a
second thermocouple, which can be heated, is installed
in series with each thermocouple so that testing of the
temperature-sensing channel can be performed without
disturbing the circuitry. The test devices which in-
corporate  these thermocouples are designated
TM-202A5, BS, and C5. Extension wiring from these
thermocouples is routed, in individual conduits for each
safety channel, to the safety panel in the auxiliary
control room where the signals are converted to 10- to
50-mA dc current signals by emf-to-current converters
TM-202A1, Bl, and CI1. This current signal operates
switches TSS202A2, B2, and C2, which initiate the
safety action discussed above, and is the input to
isolation amplifiers TM202A3, B3, and C3. The output
of these amplifiers is another 10- to 50-mA signal which
is indicated on the auxiliary board by meters TI-202A1,
B, and C, and on the main control board by TI-202A2.
This signal also operates six switches — two in each
channel. Three of these (TS-202A, B, and C) operate a
common annunciator (TS-202A) on the main board.

AT

Thermocouples on the coolant system freeze flanges
are identical to those used on the fuel system flanges
described in Sect. 3.1.3.2, and their signals are used in
the same manner.

The radiator inlet and outlet salt temperature sensors
are calibrated thermocouples installed in wells
TW-201A1A and 2A for greater precision. Two of these
thermocouples (TE-201A1A and 2A) are differentially
connected to the input of emf/I converter TdM-201A,
whose 10- to 50-mA dc signal is proportional to the
difference between these temperatures. This signal is
then used to operate an indicator (TdI-201A) on the
main board and, in conjunction with the salt flow
signal, to produce a heat power signal (see Sect. 3.3.4),
which is logged, alarmed, and recorded in the main
control room. Signals from four thermocouples
(TE-201A1B, 1C, 2B, and 2C) are input to the data
logger.

The remaining thermocouples in the coolant salt
system are attached to the piping under each heater and
at each support. Almost all of these temperatures are
read out on the thermocouple scanner (see Sect. 6.7).

3.3.4 Flow

3.3.4.1 Coolant salt. An in-line flow venturi (FE-
201A) is installed in line 201 at the radiator inlet for
measurement of coolant salt flow. Two special NaK-
filled seal-welded differential pressure transmitters
(FT-201A and B) with a range of approximately 0 to
550 in. of water are connected across the outlet taps of
the venturi (see Sects. 6.12 and 6.13).

These flow instruments in combination with the
pump speed signals comprise three channels of coolant
flow safety signals (see Sect. 2.8.6). The wiring for each
channel is run in a separate conduit so that each
channel is physically separated from the other two. In
order to test the flow channels, provisions were made to

obtain a low flow indication by remotely shunting a

portion of the bridge circuit in the transmitter output.
The resistor used in the shunting operation is adjustable
so that the output can be smoothly varied throughout
its entire range to check the functioning of all compo-
nents in the channel operated by the transmitter. The O-

to 25-mV output from the differential pressure trans--

mitters is converted to a 10- to 50-mA dc signal by
converters FM-201A1 and B, located in the safety
panel in the auxiliary control room. In the A channel,

11

 

signal proportional to the salt flow and serves as
isolation between the safety portion of the circuit and
the indication and alarm portions of the circuit. Switch
FS-201A in conjunction with B channel switch
FS-201A operates a common (low flow) annunciator on
the main board. Switch FSS-201B provides a safety
circuit interlock (see Sect. 2.8.6). The signal from the
square root converter is indicated on the safety panel
by FI-201A, recorded on the main board by FR-201A,
and combined with the radiator AT measurements in
XpM-201 (a multiplier) to provide a signal which is
proportional to the heat power in the radiator. This
signal is also converted to a 2- to 10-V signal which is
input to the data logger. The output of XpM-201 is
recorded on the main board by XpR-201A, converted
to a 0- to 10-mV data logger signal by resistor
XpM-201A2, and input to switch XpS-201A, which is
located on the auxiliary board and which operates
annunciator XpA-201A on the main control board.

The B channel is identical to the A channel up to the
square root converter. The output of the B channel
square root converter is logged and indicated in the
same manner as the A channel but is not recorded or
used for heat power computation.

3.34.2 Coolant pump gas purge and letdown. A
weld-sealed matrix-type flow element FE-512A in line
512 (lower gas seal purge on the pump bearings)
provides a pressure drop of approximately 0 to 40 in. of
water which varies directly with helium flow in the
range of 0 to 75 standard liters/hr. A weld-sealed
differential pressure transmitter with 3- to 15-psi
output connected across the taps of this matrix supplies
a pneumatic signal proportional to the helium flow. The
3- to 15-psi pneumatic output signal from FT-512A is
routed to the control room, where it is converted to a
0- to 10-mV signal for the data logger by resistor
FM-512A and input to switch FS-512A and vertical
scale pneumatic indicating controller FIC-512A. Switch
FS-512A operates annunciator FA-512A on the main
board. The output of controller FIC-512A is used to
operate valve FCV-512A1 which, in turn, controls the

flow of helium in line 512. A solenoid valve FCV-

the 10- to 50-mA signal is the input to switches

FS201A and FSS201A and to square root convérter
FM201A1, which provides an output 10- to 50-mA

512A2 in the supply line to the throttling valve
FCV-512A1 allows the helium flow to be shut off by
the use of contacts in the control circuit in the event of
low - helium supply pressure (see Sect. 4.2.5). This
system is similar to the fuel pump purge system shown
in Figs.3.1.00r 3.140.

A weld-sealed matrix-type flow element FE-526C in
line 526 (upper bearing gas seal leakage) provides a
pressure drop of approximately O to 40 in. of water,
which varies directly with the off-gas flow in the range

 
 

 

 

-

of 0 to 4.5 standard litersfhr. A weld-sealed electric
differential pressure transmitter connected across the
taps of this matrix supplies a 10- to 50-mA dc signal
which is proportional to the off-gas flow in line 526. In
the main control room, this 10- to S0-mA signal is
indicated on F1-526C, converted to a 2- to 10-V signal
for the data logger by resistor FM-526C2, and input to
switch FS-526C, which operates low flow annunciator
FA-526C on the main board. This system is similar to
the fuel pump gas letdown system shown in Fig. 3.1.0.

3.3.5 Coolant Pump Motor Parameters

The coolant pump motor parameters measured are
speed, current, voltage, power, and bearing noises.

The speed indicating system is a dual track system
similar to the fuel pump speed system described in Sect.
3.1.6.7. Contacts SS-CP-G1 and 2 operate a common
low-speed annunciator in the control room. Contacts
SSS-CP-G1 and 2 are connected in parallel and in one
channel of a two-out-of-three matrix in the load control
safety circuitry (see Sect. 2.8.6). A low-level dc signal
from the pulse counter is used to provide a speed signal
to the logging system.

Current, voltage, and power measurements are made
by use of current and potential transformers in the
pump motor leads. The secondaries of these trans-
formers are connected to an ammeter (E,I-CP-D), a
wattmeter (E,I-CP-D), and a watt converter in the
main control room and to a watt recorder (E,,R-CP-D)
in the transmitter room. The signal from the converter
is input to the data logger.

The microphone (XdBE-CP) used for noise pickup is a
high-temperature ceramic microphone (see Sect. 6.17),
which through selector switching is connected to a
common audio amplifier in the auxiliary control room.
There is no alarm or automatic action taken from the
noise signal.

3.3.6 Beryllium Monitoring and Radiation

Since beryllium concentration in air provides a good
indicator of a coolant salt leak and is hazardous to
operating personnel, an automatic beryllium monitor
(AgE-1010) is used to monitor the air in the radiator
exhaust and in the coolant cell. The monitor consists of
a Jarrell-Ash monochrometer, high-voltage spark and
auxiliary spark for existing beryllium, a photomultiplier
and associated amplifier, and a recorder (A gR-1010).
A vacuum source is used to obtain continuous air flow
from the coolant stack. The monitor and associated
equipment are located in the high bay. Two timers on
the monitor are used to control spark time in either an

12

intermittent or continuous mode. The recorder provides
a high-level alarm contact (A gS-1010) which operates
an annunciator (AgpA-1010) in the main control room.
No automatic control action is taken from this parame-
ter.

An ion chamber for sensing high levels of gamma
activity was installed in the vicinity of the coolant -
pump bowl. The output of this chamber is indicated on
an electrometer in the auxiliary control room. This
signal is alarmed on high activity and logged on the data
logger. No automatic control action is taken.

3.3.7 Coolant Radiator

Instrumentation was provided in the coolant radiator
system for measurement and/or control of tempera-
tures, air flows, radiator door and damper positioners,
and of motor vibration and beryllium content in the
radiator outlet air stream. This instrumentation is
shown in Fig. 3.3.1.

3.3.7.1 Temperature. All temperature measurements
except the inlet and outlet air temperatures are made
with Inconel-sheathed mineral-insulated Chromel-
Alumel thermocouples. |

One hundred twenty thermocouples (TE-CR1 through
CR-120) measure the temperature at the outlet of each
of the radiator tubes (see Sect. 6.7). Signals from these
thermocouples are input to the temperature scanner
system (Sect. 6.14) which initiates an alaim if any tube
outlet temperature drops below set point. During
normal operations, low radiator tube outlet tempera-
ture is a indication of possible flow blockage and/or
freezing of salt in the tube. Thermocouples TE-121
through 149 measure the temperature. of structural
members at 49 points within the radiator enclosure.

Eight thermocouples measure the temperature at four
points on the annulus walls. Four of these (TE-AD3-4,
5A, 6, and 7A) are input to the data logger. Thermo-
couples TE-SB and 7B operate alarm switches TS-SB
and 7B, which, in turn, operate a common annunciator
TS-AD3-7B in the main control room.

Two resistance-type sensors measure the radiator inlet
and outlet air temperatures. The inlet sensor (TE-
ADI1-1A) measures the temperature of ambient air
before entrance to the radiator and annulus. The outlet
sensor (TE-AD3-8A) is located near the top of the stack
and measures the mixed mean of the radiator and
annulus air ‘temperatures. Resistance-to-current con-
verters (TMADI-1A1 and TM-AD3-8A1) convert the
sensor resistance to a 10- to 50-mA signal which is
converted to a 2- to 10-V signal for the data logger by
resistors TM-AD1-1A2 and T}VI-AD3-8A2, and to a main
 

 

 

 

 

board indication by meters TI-AD1-1A-and AD3-8A.
These measurements together with -the- stack flow
measurement discussed below provide a measure of heat
removed from the radiator by the air stream.

Four thermocouples (TE-MB1-1, MB1-2, MB3-1, and
MB3-2) measure the temperature of the main blower
shaft bearings. Signals from these sensors are input to
the data logger.

3.3.7.2 Air flow. The combmed annulus and radiator
air flow is measured by a pitot-venturi (FE-AD3A)
positioned to read average flow under full-power
conditions. The output from the pitot-venturi (about
10 in. of water at 4300-fpm velocity) is measured by a
pneumatic differential pressure transmitter (FT-AD3A)
located on the stack. The 3- to 15-psig output signal
from the differential pressure transmitter is indicated in
the main control room by FI-AD3A and converted to a
0- to 10-mV electric signal for the data logger by strain
gage transducer FM-AD3A. There are no alarm or
control functions associated with this measurement of
coolant air flow. '

In conjuiction with the radiator. inlet and outlet
temperatures, this measurement provides a method of
determining heat removed from the system by the
radiator and, together with other heat balance measure-
ments, provides another means of determining reactor
power. However, the full potential of this type of
measurement was not realized in the MSRE because the
pitot-venturi installed is not capable of accurate mea-
surement of flow in the 10-ft-diam stack under all flow
conditions, and other factors such as air leakage
through duct walls and the presence of heaters in the
radiator contribute other inaccuracies in the heat
balance. -

Annulus air flow downstream of each auxiliary
blower is monitored by vane-type flow switches FS-
MB2-B1 and MB4-Bl which operate annunciators FA-
MB2B and MB4B when annulus flow is low. - :

3.3.7.3 Damper position. Each of the blowers on the
coolant radiator has associated with it a pneumatically

13

associated fan motor is running and closes when the fan
is stopped. ,

The position of the radlator bypass damper is
controlled by a pneumatic operator (HCO-AD2) which
is in turn controlled by controller P4C-AD2A through
booster relay P4M-AD2A1. The controller obtains its
signal from differential pressure transmitter P4T-AD2A
and positions the damper to maintain the pressure drop
across the radiator at the controller set point which is
determined by motor-driven pneumatic ramp generator
P;X-AD2A1. The ramp generator increases or decreases
the set point signal at a predetermined rate in response
to signals from the control circuit. The bypass damper
may also be positioned manually by switching the
controller to “manual.” Switches P4SS-AD2-A1, A2,
and A4 provide interlock contacts for the radiation

-control circuitry (see Sect. 2.8, part 11A). Pressure gages

- P41-AD2-Al, A2, and A3 provide indications of radia-

tor differential pressure demand (setpoint), differential
pressure, and damper position in the main control
room. Switches ZS-AD2-A1 and A2 detect the open
and closed positions of the damper and operate control
circuit interlocks, as well as indicator lamps ZI-AD2-A1
and A2 which are located on the console. Strain gage
pressure transducer P4M-AD2-A4 provides a signal to
the data logger proportional to the radiator air differ-
ential pressure.

3.3.7.4 Radiator door position. The radiator doors
are positioned by a single electric motor which drives a
cable and drum-type operating mechanism for each
door. The shafts between the motor and the two drums
are equipped with magnetic brakes and magnetic
clutches (see Sect. 2.8, part IIA). The doors may be
positioned manually by switches on the console or
automatically by control circuitry. Deenergizing the
clutch initiates a rapid door closure (see Sects. 2.8 and
4.4). |

Synchro transmitters (ZT-ID-A and OD-A) on each
door detect door position and operate Teceiver-

~indicators ZI-ID-A and OD-A which are located on the

operated ‘“backflow preventer” which is automatically

operated in conjunction with the blower start-stop
switching (see Sect. 4.4). The position of the backflow
damper is detected by position switches ZS-MB1-Al and
A2, MB2-Al and' A2, MB3-Al"and A2, an’d'MB4—Al
and A2, indicated in the main control room by “open”

“shut” ‘indicator lights ZI-MB1-Al and A2, MB2-Al
and A2, MB3-Al and A2, and MB4-Al and A2.
Solenoid valves ECV-MB1A, MB2A, MB3A, and MB4A
control pneumatic damper position operators -ECO-
MB1A, MB2A, MB3A, and MB4A in response to signals
from the control circuits. Each damper opens when its

console and give a continuous display of radiator door
position. Each position-detecting system transmits two
signals to the data logger; one comes directly from the
synchro transmitter and the other is generated by a
synchro-driven potentiometer. Power supply ZX-OD-ID
supplies voltage to the potentiometers. Intermediate
limit switches ZS-ID-A1 and A2 and ZS-OD-A1 and A2
are mechanically coupled to the synchro transmitters.
The switch contacts are used as interlocks for the
radiator control circuits and indirectly to .operate
indicating lamps ZI-ID-A2 and A3 and ZI-OD-A2 and
A3 which are located on the console. Upper and lower

 

 
 

 

limit switches ZS-1D ‘and OD-B1 and B2, C1 and C2,
D1 and D2, B3B and B4B are also used as control
circuit interlocks and indirectly to operate indicating
lamps on the console and main board.

3.3.7.5 Vibration. Vibration pickups MB1 and-

MB2-BI, B2, B3, and B4 installed on each of the blower
shaft and motor bearings give information on the
dynamic balance of the blowers. The output from the
vibration pickups is manually selectable for readout on
a single indicator for each main blower in the water
room. There is no automatic alarm or control function
associated with this measurement.

3.3.7.6 Beryllium monitoring. The stack beryllium
monitor Ag-1010 is discussed in Sect. 3.3.6.

3.4 COOLANT SALT FILL AND DRAIN SYSTEM

The process instrumentation for the coolant salt fill
and drain system is shown in Fig. 3.3.0. This system
consists of the coolant drain tank, the salt charging
system, and piping connection of the drain tank to the
circulation system. All components except the salt
charging system, which is a temporary system used for
both the fuel and coolant system, are located in the
coolant drain tank cell, which is completely accessible
when the reactor is subcritical for any maintenance or
repair.

The process variables monitored in the coolant drain
and fill system are:

pressure,
level,

. weight,
temperature.

W -

3.4.1 Pressure

The pressure measuring and controlling elements
associated with the salt charging system consist of
standard non-bleed pressure regulators and pressure
‘gages. Helium is utilized to pressurize small salt cans
which have been heated in a furnace to above liquidus
temperature, forcing the salt to flow into the coolant
drain tank through line 203. At the conclusion of the
filling operation, line 203 is blanked off and the salt
charging apparatus removed from the system.

The pressure control scheme for the coolant drain
tank is similar to that used in the fuel drain tank system
described in Sect. 3.2.1. The coolant drain tank helium
cover gas pressure is used to push the salt from the
drain tank to the pump bowl and hold its level while

.':,

the freeze valves are being frozen. This pressure is
controlled by weld-sealed throttling valve PCV-511C
which is, in turn, controlled by controller PIC-511C in
response to a signal from weld-sealed pressure trans-
mitter PT-511C. This pressure signal is converted to a 2-
to 10-V signal for the data logger by resistor PM-511C2
and indicated in the main control room on PIC-511C.
No restrictions of fill rate are required in this system
since the consequences of rapid fill or an overfill are
minimal. However, the fill rate may be limited by
setting the position of weld-sealed throttling valve
HCV-511B. This is accomplished by manually adjusting
pressure regulator HIC-511B, which is located on the
main control board. A pneumatically operated weld-
sealed valve (HCV-511A1), located downstream from
the pressure control valve, blocks the helium supply in
the event of high pump bowl level, high drain tank
pressure, emergency drain request, or low helium
supply pressure. These actions are initiated by the
control circuit via solenoid valve HCV-511A2.

The pressure in the drain tank is detected by a
weld-sealed differential pressure transmitter (PT-511D)
whose 10- to 50-mA electric signal is converted to a 2-
to 10-V data logger signal by resistor PM-511D2, and to
a 3- to 15-psig pneumatic signal by current-to-air
converter PM-511D3. The pneumatic signal operates a
recorder (PR-511D) and three switches on the main
board. Switches PS-511D1 and D2 operate a common
(high-low) annunciator on the main board. Switch
PSS-511D1 provides an interlock for the control circuit
(see Sect. 4.2.4).

Venting the drain tank to the off-gas system and
equalizing the drain tank and coolant pump bowl
pressures are accomplished by opening weld-sealed
pneumatically operated valves HCV-527-Al, 536-Al, and
547A1 in the drain tank cell. Each of these valves has
position switches attached which operate lamps in the
main control room. These valves are controlled by
solenoid valves which are controlled by the control

circuits (see Sect. 4.2.4).

3.42 Salt Inventory

The inventory of salt in the coolant drain tank is
sensed by two independent methods — level and weight.
Except for the application numbers assigned, these
systems are the same as the fuel drain tank level and
weight systems described in Sect. 3.2.2. However,
containment block valves were not required on pneu-
matic lines associated with the coolant drain tank
weight system.
 

 

 

15

34.3 Temperature

Temperatures are measured in the coolant fill and
drain system on salt lines, on freeze valves, and on the
drain tank. o

Salt line temperatures in the coolant fill and drain
system are measured in the same manner as on other
salt lines in the coolant salt system (see Sect. 3.3.3).

The measurement of temperatures on and the control
of freeze valves FV-204 and 206 are similar to those of
freeze valve FV-206, described in Sect. 3.1.3. Except
for the application number assigned and the source of
cooling air, the component used and the method of
operation are the same. The air used to cool FV-204
and 206 is supplied by a small Roots blower (com-
ponent cooling pump no. 3) or alternately from the
service air compressor.

The coolant drain tank temperatures are measured by
13 thermocouples at nine locations on the tank. All
thermocouples are %-in.-OD Inconel-sheathed, magne-
sium oxide-filled Chromel-Alumel thermocouples which
are Heliarc welded to the vessel (see Sect. 6.7).

All thermocouples are terminated in single Thermo
Electric thermocouple disconnects. From this discon-
nect, individual runs of thermocouple extension wire
are used going to a junction box in the drain tank cell.
From the junction box, all thermocouples are routed to
the thermocouple patch panel and then to the tempera-
ture scanner system, where out-of-limit temperatures
are scanned, indicated, and alarmed. There is no
automatic control action taken from any of these
temperature signals.

3.5 HELIUM COVER GAS SYSTEM

The cover gas system is shown in Fig. 3.5.0. The
system consists of the helium supply trailer and its
backup cylinder bank, a molecular sieve-type dryer for
moisture removal, a preheater, a titanium sponge-type
oxygen removal “Unit, an oxygen content detection
system, a receiver tank, and the helium distribution
system. Duplicate dryer, preheater, and oxygen removal
systems are provided so that one system can be
rejuvenated (using a low back purge of clean dry
helium) while the other is in service. _'

The parameters measured in this system are:

1. pressure,
2. flow,
3. temperature,

4. oxygen content,

5. radioactivity,
6. leak detection.

Except for a weld-sealed pressure transmitter on the
treated helium storage tanks, a weld-sealed differential
pressure-type flow transmitter, a weld-sealed flow con-
trol valve, and some specially fabricated thermocouples,
instrumentation components used in this system are
standard commercially available types. However, to
minimize helium outleakage and oxygen inleakage, a
special effort was made to select components which
were inherently leak-tight or could be made so before
installation. For example, standard regulators with
neoprene diaphragms were used, but selected regulators
were tested for oxygen inleakage, and all regulators
were checked under pressure for helium leakage.

3.5.1 Pressure

Pressure of helium from the supply trailer and/or
bottles is reduced from an initial pressure of 2500 psig
to approximately 250 psig by regulator PCV-500G
before entrance to the dryer. Regulator inlet and outlet
pressures are locally indicated on gages PI-500G1 and
G2, which are integrally mounted on the regulator.
Gages PI-502A and B provide local indication of
pressure at the cylinder banks.

The pressure of treated helium in the storage tank is
measured by weld-sealed electric pressure transmitter
PT-500 (see Sect, 6.2), which has a 0 to 300 psig range.
The 10- to 50-mA signal from this transmitter operates
meter-type indicator PI-500A in the control room and
is converted to a 2- to 10-V data logger signal by
resistor PM-500A2. Pressure in the storage tank is also
indicated locally on pressure gage PI-HeA.

Regulator PCV-500C or PCV-605A further reduces
the helium pressure to 40 psig before entrance to the
low-pressure headers which supply various systems.
These regulators are redundant, and, by appropriate
valving, either may be used as the operating regulator or
removed for maintenance. Pressure gage PI-500M pro-
vides a local indication of pressure downstream from
these regulators. : o |

To avoid overloading the dryers and oxygen removal
units, helium for operations, such as fuel processing
plant sparging, where usage is high and helium quality
requirements are not stringent, is supplied from line

530, which is connected ahead of the dryers. Reduced

pressure for these operations is supplied by regulator
PCV-530B. Gages PI-530B!1 and B2 provide local
inductions of pressures at the inlet and outlet of this
regulator. '
 

 

 

16

Regulators PCV-548A and PCV-549A supply helium -

at reduced pressure to the moisture and oxygen
analyzers from taps upstream and downstream of the
treatment systems. '

All pressure switches in the cover gas system actuate
Rochester alarm units (see Sect. 4.12) in the auxiliary
control room, which, in turn, actuate a common
annunciator in the main control room.

- Switch PS-500E initiates an alarm when the supply
helium pressure drops below set point. Switches
PS-500B1 and B2 monitor the pressure at the dryer
inlet and initiate an alarm if this pressure is too high or
too low. Switch PS-500K initiates an alarm when the
pressure in the storage tank is low.

Pressure switches PS-506 and PS-507 initiate alarms
when the pressure in lines 506 and 507 is near the burst
rating of the rupture disks in these lines.

Switches PS-500L1 and L2 initiate an alarm if the
pressure in the low-pressure supply header deviates
significantly from 40 psig.

Pressure switch PS-S08AS, located downstream from
the rupture disk in line 508, initiates an alarm if the
rupture disk fails. Under normal conditions pressure
downstream from the rupture disk is vented to the
stack through an excess flow valve connected across a
relief valve. If the disk ruptures, the excess flow valve
closes, and the pressure is maintained near 40 psig by a
relief valve which also prevents a total loss of helium.
This arrangement was used because the probability of
spurious failures of the 50-psig-rated disk was con-
sidered to be high, the leakage through a relief valve

- used alone was excessive, and because maintenance of

pressure in the helium supply system is necessary for
continued operation of the reactor.

Three safety switches (PSS-500N1, N2, and N3)
monitor the pressure in the 40-psig helium header.
These switches provide interlocks for safety circuits
which close containment block valves in helium supply
lines if the helium supply pressure is low (see Sect.
4.8.1). Provisions were made to test the operation of
these switches without actuating closure of the block
valves. This was done by connecting the switch contacts
in a two-out-of-three matrix and by placing a flow
restrictor (PxM-500N1, N2, and N3) upstream of each
switch and pressure gages and valving downstream. To
test the switch, the valves in the associated line are
opened, and the resultant flow causes a pressure drop
across the restrictor which reduces the pressure at the
switch. By throttling the valves, the pressure at which
the switch actuates can be determined in the associated
pressure indicator (PI-SOON1, N2, or N3).

3.5.2 Flow

A pneumatic throttling valve (FCV-500J), located
upstream of the helium storage tank, is used to limit the
flow of helium through the dryers and oxygen removal
units and thus ensure adequate removal of moisture and
oxygen from the helium. The position of this valve is
controlled by a pneumatic indicator-controller
(FIC-5001]) in response to a flow signal obtained from a
matrix-type flow element (FE-500]) located just up-
stream of the valve in line 500. Both the valve and the
flow element are weld-sealed (see Sects. 6.5 and 6.19).

The flow element provides a pressure drop of approxi-
mately 0 to 49 in. H, O which varies directly with
helium flow, in the range of O to 10 standard liters/min.
A seal-welded pneumatic differential pressure trans-
mitter (FT-500F) connected to the taps of the flow
element produces a 3- to 15-psig pneumatic signal
which varies linearly with the helium flow. This signal is
transmitted to a pressure switch (FS-500J) and to the
indicator-controller which is located in the diesel house.
The pressure switch operates a Rochester alarm unit in
the auxiliary room, on high flow, which, in turn,
actuates the common helium system annunciator in the
control room. The set point of FIC-500J is set so that
valve FCV-500J remains full open during normal helium
usage and closes to the control position when helium
demand is high. During high usage periods, such as
filling operations, the helium demand is supplied from
the storage tank. This causes a drop in storage tank
pressure which is restored when demand is low.

3.5.3 Temperature

Temperatures in the cover gas system are measured
with 4-in. stainless steel sheathed, magnesium oxide-
filled Chromel-Alumel thermocouples Heliarc welded to
the vessels and piping. These thermocouples are termi-
nated in single thermocouple quick disconnects. With
few exceptions all of these thermocouples are located
on the dryers, preheaters, and oxygen removal units and
connect to instrumentation located on cover gas panels
1 and 2 in the diesel house. The fabrication of these
thermocouples and the method of installation and
attachment are discussed further in Sect. 6.7. Individual
runs of polyvinyl-insulated thermocouple extension
wire are used between the thermocouple disconnects
and the panels. Two thermocouples are located on each
of the dryers and preheaters and six on each oxygen
removal bed. In each case, one thermocouple is input to
an indicator-controller for on-off control of the heater
associated with that particular vessel, and the other
 

thermocouple is input to a second indicator-controller
which functions as a high-temperature safety cutout for
the heater and operates a common high-temperature
annunciator in the main control room. For example,
thermocouple TE-DRI-I on dryer no. 1 is input to
indicator-controller TIC-DR1-1, which controls the
heater, and thermocouple TE-DR1-2 is input to indi-
cator-controller TS-D21-2, which has two contacts —
one of which is used as a high-temperature interlock in
the heater control circuits and the other to actuate the
common annunciator (TA-DR2-2). The indicator-
controllers are a direct-actuated galvanometer type
manufactured by Wheelco. Except for the application
numbers assigned and the extra thermocouples on the
oxygen removal units, the instrumentation and control
of Dryer No. 2 and of the preheaters and oxygen
removal units are identical. Four of the extra thermo-
couples on the oxygen removal units (TE-ORL-1B and
2B and TE-OR2-1B and 2B) are installed spares.
Thermocouples TE-OR1-3 and OR2-3 measure gas inlet
temperature and are installed in wells. Thermocouples
TE-OR1-4 and TE-OR2-4 measure gas discharge temper-
ature and are inserted through a gland into the gas
space. All temperatures in this system are read out on
the cover gas panels. For further discussion of the
heater control circuits see Sect. 4.9.6.

Three thermocouples (TE’s 500-1 and 2 and 503-1)
are located on the piping, one ahead of each dryer and
one after the helium flow regulating valve in line 500.
These temperatures are read out on a direct- actuated
meter indicator (TIE-500-1). A manual thermocouple
selector switch (HS-500-1) is used to select the thermo-
couple for readout. The indicator and switch are
located on cover gas panel no. 2.

One thermocouple (TE-516-1) monitors the tempera-

ture of the gas purge to the fuel circulating pump. This
thermocouple is attached to the outside of line 516 and

17

is read out on a precision indicator in the control room.

35 4 Oxygen and Moisture Content

Standard commercial water and ‘oxygen analyzers are

used to determine the moisture and oxygen content of

the helium gas either before or after the treatment to

remove .these contaminants.” A recorder, “locally

 

3.5.5 Radioactivity

A Geiger-Mueller tube (RE-500D) monitors the ac-
tivity of gas in line 500 at a point in the water room
near the first takeoff of the low-pressure lines which
supply the various reactor systems. The purpose of this
monitor is to detect back diffusion of radioactive gases
from the reactor system. This detector provides a signal
to a three-decade readout device (RM-500D) which is
located in the auxiliary control room and contains an
integral indicator (RI-500D) and a switch (RS-500D).
The switch operates a high radiation annunciator
(RA-500D) in the main control room. The readout
device, which also supplies a millivolt level signal to the
data logger, is an ORNL model Q-1916, described in
Sect. 2.10, Part IIA of this report. There is no
automatic action taken from this variable.

3.5.6 Leak Detection

The leak detection system is shown in Fig. 3.5.1. All
leak detectable connections in the system are brought
in to one of the eight leak detector headers. Since each
joint or joint system is valved in individually, trouble
shooting can be made easy by first isolating banks, then
individual lines.

3.6 OFF-GAS, CONTAINMENT PRESSURE, AND
COMPONENT COOLANT SYSTEMS

The systems covered in this section are shown in Fig.
3.6.0. They consist of the containment pressure and
component coolant systems, the main and auxiliary
charcoal beds, and the off-gas trouble-shooting system.

| 3.6.!_ Component Coolant System

The component coolant system is used for recircu-
lating the air in the reactor and drain tank cells. The
system, which forms a closed circuit, consists of
component coolant pumps, an air cooler, piping, and a
cross-connect valving system. The pumps and their

~associated oil circulating system are located in enclo-

mounted in the output of the oxygen monitor, contin-

uously records this information. There are no alarm or
automatic control actions taken on either of these
variables.

sures in the special equipment room. Two pumps are
provided because continuous flow of component cool-

ing air is required to maintain freeze valves in their

closed condition and .is, therefore, a service which is
vital to reactor operation. Since the component coolant
air-lines penetrate the reactor cell walls and are open
ended inside the reactor cell, the component cooling

 
 

 

 

system is, in itself, part of secondary containment and
is subject to the same rules governing pressure ratings
and permissible leakage. For this reason, all instrumen-
tation components of this system containing compo-
nent cooling air have a pressure rating of at least 50 psig
and were made essentially leak-tight at this pressure.
Weld-sealed construction was not required to meet the
leakage requirements; however, close attention to all
possible leakage paths through connections, gaskets,
etc., was required to keep the total overall leakage
within acceptable limits.

The component cooling pumps are basically positive
displacement devices, and the pressure rise across the
pumps is determined mainly by the flow demand
imposed by the load. Since this load is determined by
requirements for cooling air on freeze valves, which
vary widely, and since a constant supply pressure was
required for proper operation of the various cooling air
control valves, the cooling air supply pressure is
controlled by means of a pneumatically actuated
throttling-type control valve (P4CV-960A) which loads
the pumps by venting air to the reactor cell. This valve

18

pressure. A restrictor (FE-960A), connected between
the vent and supply lines, allows the valve to fail to its

open position in the event of cell blockage.

is located inside the reactor cell and is sized to pass the

full output of the pump without excessive pressure rise.
The pressure rise across the component coolant pump
(minus the drop across the air cooler) controls the
position of this valve and is measured by an electric
differential pressure transmitter (PdT-960A) located in
the special equipment room. The transmitter amplifier
(PAM-960A1) is remotely located in the transmitter
room. The 10- to 50-mA output from the transmitter
amplifier is converted to a 2- to 10-V signal for the data
logger by resistor PAM-960A2 and to a 3- to 15-psig
pneumatic  signal by current-to-air  converter
Pdm-960A3. The pneumatic signal is then transmitted
to the main control room where it is input to a
vertical-scale pneumatic indicator-controller (PdIC-
960A) and two pressure switches. Switch PdS-960A1
operates a high differential pressure annunciator (Pa-
960A) in the main control room. Switch PdS-960A2
operates solenoid valve PACV-960A2 via the control
circuits and shuts off supply air to the controller. This
arrangement eliminates startup pressure overshoots re-
sulting from the reset-windup characteristics of the
controller. (For further information on the component
cooling pump control circuit, see Sect. 4.9.4.) Booster
relay PAM-960A4 amplifies the 3- to 15-psig output of
the controller to the 6- to 30-psig pressure required for
operation of PCV-960A. Pneumatically operated con-
tainment block valves (HSV-960A1 and A2), located in
the supply and vent lines to this valve, provide means
for blocking these lines in the event of high cell

Pressure switches PS-791A and PS-795A in the oil
supply lines to each of the component coolant pumps
provide contacts which are used in the control circuitry
to stop the pump on loss of oil pressure (see Sect.
494). Switches PS-791B and PS-795B operate a
common annunciator (PA-791B) in the main control
room when the oil supply pressure on either pump is
low.

A pressure switch (PS-917A1) referenced to the
pressure inside the pump enclosure operates an annun-
ciator (PA-917A) in the auxiliary room when the

" cooling air supply pressure is low.

The air temperatures at the pump inlet and outlet and
at the cooler outlet are measured by thermocouples
TE-922-1, 916, and 917, which are installed in wells.
The signals from these termocouples are input to the
data logger.

3.6.2 Containment Pressure Control

In order to maintain the containment cells at a slight
negative pressure (~2 psig negative), a small amount of
the air at the discharge from the air cooler (before the
pressure control valve) is vented to the containment
stack through line 569. A manually controlled con-
tinuous flow is maintained through this line to take care
of any inleakage to the cell. The gas stream flows past

radiation detectors RE-565B and C. Signals from these

detectors are input to ORNL Q-1916 radiation moni-
tors RM-565B and C (see Sect. 2.10). These monitors
are located in the auxiliary control room and provide
indication of radiation level on integrally mounted
meters RI-565B and C, millivolt level signals for the
data logger, and high-level switch contacts RS-565B2
and C2 and RSS-565B1 and C1, which are used to
operate annunciator RA-565B in the main control room
and as safety circuit interlocks (see Sect. 4.7.2). One of
the actions taken by the safety circuits when these
switches operate is closure of valve HCV-565A1, which
blocks the flow of air from the reactor cell to the stack.
This valve is a pneumatically operated fail-closed type
with open-shut trim. Its position is controlled by
solenoid valve HCV-562A2 and detected by position
switch ZS-565A1, which operates position indicators
Z1-565A1 and A2 on the main control board.

The flow of air through line 565 to the' stack is
measured by a rotameter (FI-569B) and by a differ-
ential pressure transmitter (FT-569A) connected across
a capillary flow element (FE-569A) located in line 569.

-
 

The pneumatic output of the transmitter is indicated
locally in the vent house on pressure gage FI-569A and
is converted to a millivolt level signal for the data logger
by strain gage pressure transducer FM-569A.

The pressure inside the reactor containment enclosure
is measured by a 0- to 65-psia absolute pressure
transmitter (PT-RCA). The transmitter amplifier (PM-
RCA1) is remotely located in the transmitter room.
The 10-to 50-mA signal from this transmitter is used to
operate an indicator (PI-RCA) in the main control room
and switches PS-RCA1 and A2 in the auxiliary control
room. It is also converted to a 2- to 10-V signal for the
data logger by resistor PM-RCA-2. The switch actions
are used by the control circuit to stop cell evacuation
and to operate an annunciator (PA-RCA) in the main
control room when cell air pressure is too low.

In order to detect cell leakage, a precision measureé-
ment of changes in cell pressure was required. To
achieve this, a number of cell reference volumes were
installed in the reactor and drain tank cell. These cell
reference volumes are 20-ft sections of 5-in. piping
interconnected and sealed so as to present a reflection
of the past pressure and provide a reasonable amount of
temperature compensation. A direct measurement of
the difference in the pressure of the reference volume
and the containment cell is made with hook gage
PdI-RC-E, which can easily measure pressure differences
in the order of 0.0005 in. H,0 and provides a relatively
simple yet accurate measurement of changes in cell
pressure. Containment block valves HSV-RC-E1 and E2
isolate this device from the reactor cell on command
from the containment safety circuits. Pressure gage
PI-RCE-1 provides a local indication of cell pressure.
There are no alarms or control functions associated
with this measurement.

A second method of measurement of cell leakage is
the use of oxygen analysis of the cell gas. Since the
system is purged with nitrogen only, any change in
oxygen content is from inleakage of air. An oxygen
analyzer (A-0,A-566A) is installed to sample the
recirculating gas in line 566. Block valves HCV-Al, A2,
~ A3, and A4, located before and after the analyzer, close
on high cell activity or pressure There are no alarm or
control functions associated with this measurement.
For further discussion of this system see Sect. 6.4.

Six pressure switches (PSS-RC-B, G, F, H, J, and K)
- provide reactor cell pressure information to the safety

circuits.” The switches provide three channels of infor-
‘mation. Each channel consists of a high and a low
~pressure switch. Means ‘were provided to check the
operation in each channel separately (see Sects. 1.5 and
4.8.3). There are .no alarm or control functions asso-
ciated with this measurement.

3.6.3 Main and Auxiliary Charcoal Beds

The portion of the off-gas system that is shown in
Fig. 3.6.0 consists of four main charcoal beds, two
auxiliary charcoal beds, particle traps, and the piping
interconnecting these components. The parameters
monitored in this system are:

1. pressure,
2. level,

3. temperature,

4. radioactivity.

3.6.3.1 Pressure. The pressure drop across the main
charcoal beds is measured by a weld-sealed differential
pressure transmitter (PdT-556A). The amplifier for this
transmitter (PAM-556A1), which is remotely located in
the transmitter room, transmits a 10- to 50-mA signal
to the auxiliary control room where it operates recorder
PdR-556A.and is converted to a 2- to 10-V signal for
the data logger. There are no alarm or control functions
associated with this measurement.

A pneumatic pressure transmitter, PT-564A, monitors
the pressure downstream from the main charcoal beds.
The 3- to 15-psig output from the transmitter operates
recorder PR-564A in the main control room. This
pressure, together with the pressure drop across the
charcoal beds and the pump bowl pressure, yields a
pressure balance of the off-gas system and allows the
pressure drop across the particle trap to be inferred.

3.6.3.2 Level. The level of cooling water in the pit
enclosing the main charcoal beds is measured by means
of a dip-tube-type bubbler and a direct-readout gage
(LI-CBC-A) located in the vent house. The water level is
normally maintained at the overflowing condition, but
when partial plugging of the beds occurs, the water level
is lowered and heat is applied to the bed. This in

~conjunction with external heat and gas overpressure

serves to clear up any restriction. :

3.6.3.3 Temperature. - Thermocouples -installed ' in
wells at three locations on each of the main charcoal
beds and at one position on the auxiliary charcoal bed
are ‘used as inputs to the data logger (see Sect. 6.7).
These thermocouples provide some information on the
rate of progress of fission product migratron through
the beds. ' _

Thermocouples on the particle trap in line 522 and on
the auxrhary charcoal beds are also input to the data

_logger

3.6.3.4 Radioactivity. Two G-M-type radiation detec-
tors (RE-528C and E), located on line 528, monitor the
amount of activity released from the coolant off-gas
streams. A second pair of detectors (RE-557A and B),

 
 

 

 

 

located on line 557, monitor all gas leaving either of the
charcoal beds. Signals from these detectors are input to
four ORNL Q-1916 radiation monitors (RM-528B and
C and RM-557A and B; see Sect. 2.10). These monitors
are located in the auxiliary room and provide an
indication of radiation level on integrally mounted
meters RI-528B and C and RI-557B and C, millivolt

20

level signals for the data logger, and high level switch

contacts for alarm and control circuits. Switch contacts
RS-528B1 and C1 and RS-557A2 and B2 operate
annunciators RA-528 and RA-557B in the main control
room. Contacts RSS-528B1 and C1 and RSS-557A1
and Bl are used as safety circuit interlocks. Since
activity in the coolant salt systern may indicate a
rupture in the fuel-coolant heat exchanger, the signal
from the detectors on line 528 is used by the control
circuits to initiate an emergency fuel drain and to stop
the fuel circulating pump. High activity indicated by
detectors on line 557 is used in the control circuits to
block the off-gas system by closing the off-gas vent
-valve HCV-557C1 and to vent the oil storage tanks in
the fuel and coolant oil systems (see Sect. 4.8.2). Valve
HCV-557C1 is the same type as HCV-56A2 discussed in
Sect. 3.6.2 and is similarly instrumented.

3.6.4 Off-Gas Trouble-Shooting System

Helium cylinders with pressure regulation and high-
and low-range flow indicators are used for pressure
testing, purging, and forward and back flows of the
off-gas system. This system is used both to detect and
clear areas of restrictions which occur. Pressures are
measured with locally mounted pressure gages PI-557D,
E, G, and F and PI-562A, and flows are measured with
in-line rotameters FI-557 D and E. Two-stage pressure
reduction and rupture disk protection were used to
prevent possible overpressurizing of portions of the
reactor system. Regulators PCV-567A and 563A reduce
the bottle pressure below the 50 psig rating of the
rupture disks, and regulators PCV-567A and PCV-563B
further reduce the pressure to the required operating
level. Pressure switches PS-567C and PS-563C operate
annunciators in the control room if the pressure at the
rupture disks is near their burst rating.

.3.7 LUBE OIL SYSTEMS

The lube oil systems for the fuel and coolant pump
motor bearings are shown in Figs. 3.7.0 and 3.7.1. Each
system consists of an oil supply tank, two circulating
pumps, a pressure control system, and the piping

associated with the system outside the secondary
containment. The following section discusses instru-
mentation associated with the fuel 'salt pump oil
system. Except for the application numbers assigned,
the instrumentation of the coolant salt pump oil system
is identical. Each system is an integral “package” unit
contained in an enclosure and located in the service
tunnel. All primary sensors, except the flow and
temperature sensors on the cooling water lines, are
located on the package inside the enclosure. Control
and block valves are located outside the enclosure. Most
of the other instrumentation associated with these
systems is located on nearby panels just outside of the
service tunnel. The parameters measured are:

1. pressure,

flow,

. level,

. temperature,

. motor parameters,

N v oA W N

. radioactivity.

3.7.1 Pressure

© The pressure in the oil system is maintained by
helium cover gas pressure in the oil supply tank gas

space. This pressure, which is maintained at 1 to 2 psig

in excess of the respective pump bo_wi pressures, is
sensed by weld-sealed electric pressure transmitter
PT-513A. The amplifier associated with this transmitter
(PM-513A1) is remotely located on the oil panel. The
10- to 50-mA signal from the transmitter is converted
to a 2- to 10-V signal for the data logger by resistor
PM-513A3 and to a 3- to 15-psig pneumatic signal by
current-to-air converter PM-513A2. The pneumatic
signal is used as input to an indicator (PI-513A) at the
oil package and to an indicator-controller (PIC-513A) in
the main control room. The output from the controller
supplies two throttling valves, PCV-513A1 in the gas
supply line and PCV-513A2 in the vent line. These
valves utilize split range operators so that, as the control
signal to them varies through the range of 3 to 9 psig,
the vent valve progresses from fully open to fully
closed. The supply valve starts to open at 9 psig and
progresses to fully open at 15 psig. In this manner a
single signal controls both the supply and venting
action, and both valves are never open at the same time.
Solenoid valves PCV-513A3 and A4 close these valves
and block the supply and vent lines on demand from
the containment safety circuits. Valves PCV-513A1 and
A2 are weld-sealed but have standard operators.

Pressure switches PS-513A1 and A2 directly monitor
the gas overpressure in the oil supply tanks and initiate
an alarm in the main control room on annunciator
PA-513A when the gas pressure is high or low.

Oil pressure at the discharge of pumps FOP-1 and
FOP-2 is indicated locally on gages PI-701A and
PI-702A. |

Pressure on each side of the oil filter is indicated on

‘gages PI1.702C and PI-703C. Information from these
gages is useful in determining pressure drop across the
filters, which is indicative of clogging.

Four pressure switches monitor the discharge pressure
of the pumps. Two of these (PS-701B1 and PS-702B1)
are connected in parallel and initiate an alarm in the
main control room on annunciator PA-701B if neither
pump is developing adequate pressure. The other two
(PS-701B2 and PS-702B2) provide low oil pressure
interlocks to control circuits which automatlcally start
the standby pump (see Sect. 4.9.3).

3.7.2 Flow.

Lubricating oil flow to the fuel salt pump bearings is
sensed by venturi flow element FE-703A, which de-
velops a differential pressure proportional to the square
- of the flow rate. This differential pressure is measured
by a weld-sealed differential pressure transmitter
(FT-703A). The amplifier associated with the trans-
mitter (FM-703A1) is remotely located on the oil panel.
The 10- to 50-mA signal from this amplifier operates an
indicator on the main board (FI-703A1), an indicator
~on the oil panel (FI-703A2), and two flow switches
(FS-703A and FSS-703A), and is converted to a 2- to
10-V signal for the data logger by resistor FM-703A2.
Switch FS-703A operates a low flow annunciator
(FA-703A) in the main control room. Switch FSS-703A
provides an interlock for the control circuits which is
used to stop the fuel salt pump when lube oil flow is
. low (see Sect. 4.2.2). _

Block valve FSV-703Bi c}oses the lubncatmg 0il
supply line to the fuel salt pump when the level in the
oil supply tank is low (see Sect. 4.9.3). This valve is
pneumatically operated via solenoid valve FSV-703B2

and is equipped with a position switch (ZS-703B1)

which operates position-indicating lamps ZI-'IOBBI and
B2 on the main control board.

Cooling oil flow to the fuel salt pump thermal shield
is sensed by venturi flow element FE-704A. Instrumen-
tation associated with this measurement is identical to
that discussed above for the lubricating oil flow. *

The flow of cooling water to the cooling coils on the
oil supply tank is monitored by rotameter FI-821A. An

21

integral switch on the rotameter initiates a low cooling
water flow alarm in the auxiliary room on annunciator
FA-821A.

3.7.3 Level

The oil level in the supply tank is measured by
float-type transmitter LT-OT1-A. The 3- to 15-psig

- pneumatic output of this transmitter operates a switch
* and three indicators and is converted to a millivolt level

signal for the data logger by strain gage transducer
IM-OT1-A. One indicator (LI-OT1-A2) is a locally
mounted gage. Another (LI-OT1-Al) is located on the
main control board. The third indicator (LT-OT1-A3) is
located on the oil panel and is equipped with two
switches. One of these switches (LS-OT1-A3) initiates
an alarm in the main control room on annunciator
LA-OT1-A3 when the oil level is low. The other switch
(LSS-OT1-A3) supplies a control circuit interlock which
closes valve FSV-703B1 and stops oil flow to the pump
bearings when the oil level is low. A third switch

- (LS-OT1-A2) is directly actuated by the pneumatic

signal. This switch operates an indicator lamp (LA-
OT1-A2) on the main control board.

3.7.4 Temperatisre

" The temperature of the oil pump motor windings is
measured with fiber-glass-insulated Chrome-Alumel
thermocouples TE- FOP-1 and 2, which are embedded in
the motor’ wmdmgs "These thermocouples operate
indicators ! TI-FOP-1 and 2, which are equipped with
integral switches (TS-FOP-1 and 2) that initiate an

"alarm in the control room on annunciator TA-FOP-1

when the temperature of either motor winding is high.

The outlet temperature is measured with stainless
steel sheathed, magnesium oxide-insulated Chromel-
Alumel thermocouples (TE-702-1A and B). The signal
from thermocouple TE-702-1B is input to-the data
logger. Thermocouple TE-702-1A is an installed spare.

The temperature of the cooling water at the inlet and
outlet of the oil supply tank cooling coils is measured
with and indicated locally on bimetallic dial indicators

~ TI-820-1 and TI-821-1, installed in weils TW-820-1 and

TW-821-1.

3.7.5 Motor Parameters _

" The current drawn by each of the motors is moni-

‘tored on an ammeter (E;I-FOP) located on the oil

panel. A manual selector switch (HS-FOP) permits the
use of a single ammeter to monitor the current of either
pump. Current transformers E,E-FOP-1 and 2 provide

 

 
 

 

 

isolation between the panel-mounted ammeters and the
motor supply voltage and step down the motor current
to within the standard 5 A full scale current required by
the meters.

3.7.6 Radiation

A G-M tube mounted on the side of the oil supply
tank is used in conjunction with an ORNL model
Q-1916 radiation monitor (OT1-B) to indicate and
alarm the radiation level of the oil system (see Sect.
2.10, Part IIA). A millivolt level signal from this
monitor is input to the data logger.

3.8 COOLING WATER SYSTEM

The complete instrument application drawing for this
system is shown in Fig. 3.8.0. The water system is
composed of three subsystems — the process water
system, the condensate water system, and the treated
water system. These subsystems are shown in a simpli-
fied form in Figs. 3.8.1, 3.8.2, and 3.8.3. Instrument
components used in these systems are conventional,
commercially available items, and the only special
requirements associated with these components were
the tight shutoff requirements for containment block
valves and the low leakage requirements for all compo-
nents of the treated water system, especially those
located within containment. The latter requirement was
met, primarily, by close supervision of installation, by
inspection, and by testing. Threaded fittings and gas-
keted joints were adequate for this service; however,
welded joints and construction were used, in some
cases, for reason of convenience or economy.

Most alarm switches in the water system actuate a
common annunciator in the main control room via
Rochester alarm units located in the auxiliary control
room (see Sect. 4.12).

Since much of the instrumentation in these systems is
repetitious, the following discussion will not describe
each application separately. Instead, repetitive applica-
tions will be discussed as a group. Also, since the
structure of individual instrument systems is conven-
tional and, in most cases, self-explanatory, reference to
instrument application numbers will be made only
where needed for clarity. In these cases the reader
should refer to the complete application drawing (Fig.
3.8.0) as well as the simplified schematics of the
subsystems.

3.8.1 Process Water System

The process water system, shown in Fig. 3.8.1,
consists of a supply (from ORNL), a cooling tower, two
circulating pumps, and the components supplied. Make-
up water for the system is added to the cooling tower
sump, whose level is controlled by a ball-float-type level
control valve. The temperature of the system is con-
trolled by manually selecting one or both of the cooling
tower fans to be in operation and by a bypass valve
(TCV-858) which is pneumatically controlled from the
temperature at the discharge of the circulating pump. In
reality the elevation of the process cooling water return
line (856) is well below the top of the cooling tower, so
the pressure drop across valve TCV-858 determines the
flow rate to the cooling tower. The temperature sensor
in this application is a gas bulb connected directly to
the transmitter (TT-858). Vapor pressure of liquid in
this bulb positions a Bourdon tube in the transmitter.
This position is converted to a 3- to 15-psig pneumatic

- signal which operates indicator-controller TIC-858,

which, in turn, operates the control valve.

All flows in the process water system except that to
the treated water cooler are measured and indicated
locally by rotameters. Rotameters on the drain tank
condensers are equipped with switches which operate
the common water system annunciator in the main
control room.

The flow to the treated water cooler was too large to
measure with a rotameter and was measured with an
orifice and differential pressure transmitter (FE and
FT-851C). The 3- to 15-psig signal from the transmitter
is indicated on a locally mounted receiver gage (FI-
851C) and used to operate a switch (FS-851-C) which
operates the common annunciator in the main control
room via Rochester alarm unit FA-851C.

Water temperatures at the outlet of the treated water
cooler and at the inlets to the pumps and the coolant
cell coolers are measured and indicated locally by dial
thermometers installed in wells in the piping.

The tempetature of the cooling tower is also meas-

ured and indicated by a dial thermometer.

Water temperatures at the inlets to the treated water
cooler and the drain tank condensers are measured with
thermocouples installed in wells. Signals from the
thermocouples are input to the data logger, where they
are used in heat balance calculations.

Pressures at the discharge of each pump and of the
supply water to the process water system and the liquid
waste system are indicated on locally mounted gages.
 

A dual pressure switch at the junction of the pump
outlets operates the common annunciator in the main
control room and provides an interlock for the control
circuit when pressure in line 851 is low. This switch
monitors the outlet pressure of both pumps, operates a
three-way penumatic control valve (HCV-882C1) via
control circuits 143 and 145, and switches the supply
to the drain tank condensers and instrument air
compressors from the pumps to the main ORNL supply
line in the event of st0ppage or malfunction of both
pumps. ‘ '

Pressure switch PS-882B operates the common annun-
ciator in the main control room when the main ORNL
supply pressure is low.

3.8.2 Condensate Water System

The condensate water system is shown in Fig. 3.8.2.
The water used in this system is condensed from steam
supplied -from X-10 (ORNL). The pressure of this steam
is indicated on a locally mounted gage (PI-SX10).
Switch PS-SX10 initiates an alarm in the control room
when supply steam pressure is low.

- The water level in each of the condensate storage
tanks is indicated by means of direct-reading sight
glasses mounted on the tanks. The level in the treated
water surge tank is indicated by a sight glass but also
controlled by a pneumatic level controller mounted on
a side well which controls a valve in the line supplymg
condensate to the tank.

The level in each of the feedwater tanks is measured
with a differential pressure transmitter. The 10 to
50-mA electric output signal from each transmitter
operates a vertical scale meter indicator and a switch in
the main control room. The. switches associated with

each tank operate a common annunciator in the main -

control room. : -
Level in each of the drain tank steam domes is
‘measured with a differential pressure transmitter. The
10 to 50-mA electric output signal from each trans-
mitter is converted .to a 3 to 15-psig pneumatic signal
which is input to a vertical scale indicator-controller in
the main control room. The output of this controller
positions a throttling-type control valve in the line
which supplies condensate to the steam dome from its
associated feedwater tank. During normal operations
the control valve is held closed by either moving the
controller. set ‘point to zero scale or by switching to
manual operation. In this mode of operation, con-
densate in the steam domes is converted to steam in the
bayonet tubes which are attached to the steam domes
and extend into the drain tanks. This steam rises to the

23

drain tank condensers and is condensed to form
condensate which then drains to the feedwater tanks.
Since the control valves are closed, this action proceeds
until all condensate is in the storage tanks and the
steam domes are dry. In this condition no heat is
withdrawn from the drain tanks by the system. If the
operator wishes to cool the drain tanks after a reactor
drain, he can do this by placing the controller on
“automatic” and raising the controller set point. The
controller then positions the control valve to admit
condensate to the steam domes at the rate required to
maintain the level requested by the set point. The
construction and mode of operation of the bayonet
tubes are such that the drain tank cooling rate is a
function of the level in the steam domes. If, for any
reason, such as an unexpected drain, the drain tank
temperature rises to 1800°F, solenoid valves ESV-806A
and 807A open and bypass condensate around the
control valves to the steam domes. In this mode of
operation the drain tank temperature is maintained at
or below 1800°F by on-off control action of the
solenoid valves.

- The temperature of steam from the domes is meas-
ured by thermocouples installed in a well near the inlet
to the drain tank condensers.

3.8.3 Treated Water System

- A simplified schematic of this system is shown in Fig.
3.8.3. Water for this system is initially supplied from
the condensate water system (Fig. 3.8.2) to a surge tank
which provides an expansion volume for the system and
a means of maintaining the required pump suction
pressure. The condensate is treated with chemicals as
required to retard fungical growth and maintain the
proper pH. Two parallel (redundant) pumps circulate
the treated water through a cooler and then through all
components served by the system. Most of these com-
ponents are inside containment and/or are exposed to
high-level nuclear radiation, so the water in this system

must not contain materlal which could be activated and

create a radiation hazard in portions of the system out-
side blologlcal shleldmg

Flow of treated water to the fuel and coolant salt
pump motor cooling coils, to the component cooling air
cooler, and to the component cooling pump oil coolers
is measured and indicated Jocally by rotameters. These
rotameters are equipped with.switches which operate
the common annunciator in the main control room
when flow is low. Flows from treated water pump no. 3
to the thermal shield and from the discharge of the

 
 

 

 

 

thermal shield inlet pressure regulator (PCV-844C) to
the surge tank are also indicated locally by rotameters.

Flows to the reactor and drain tank cell space coolers
and in the main thermal shield inlet line were too large
to measure with rotameters. These flows are measured
with.an orifice and differential pressure transmitter in
the same manner as described in Sect. 3.8.2 for the
process water flow to the treated water cooler.

Pressures at the discharge of all pumps and at the
inlets of the filter and strainer are indicated by locally
mounted gages.

Since the discharge pressure of the pumps exceeds the
pressure rating of the thermal shield, a non-bleed-type
pressure reducing regulator (PCV-844C) was provided in
the thermal shield cooling water inlet line. Additional
protection against overpressuring the thermal shield is
provided by pressure switch PSS-844B1 and by rupture
disks. The switch monitors the thermal shield inlet
pressure and closes a block valve in the inlet line
(FSV-844A1) when this pressure is too high. The

pressure at the discharge of the regulator and at the -

inlet to the thermal shield is indicated locally by
pressure gages. Pressure switch PS-844B1 initiates an
alarm in the main control room when the pressure at
the inlet to the thermal shield approaches the rating of
the rupture disk. The discharge lines from the rupture
disks are vented to the vapor condenser. Since high
pressure in these lines, which normally operate at or
slightly below atmospheric pressure, would degrade the
effectiveness of the rupture disks, a pressure switch
(PSS-855A1) was installed to monitor the pressure
below the rupture disks and initiate an alarm in the
main control room if this pressure rises slightly above
atmospheric. To maintain the pressure at the regulator
discharge when the block valve (PCV-844C) is closed, a
small water flow is bled from the regulator discharge to
the surge tank. This flow rate is indicated locally by a
rotameter.

Water discharging from the thermal shield is routed
through a degassing tank where radiolytic gases gene-
rated in the thermal shield are removed and vented to
the stack. Water level in the degassing tank is controlled
by throttling a valve in the return line from the
- degassing tank. A differential pressure transmitter meas-
ures the level and transmits a 3- to 15-psig pneumatic
signal to a level recorder-controller located in the vent
house. The pneumatic output signal from this controller
positions the control valve.

The air pressure above water level in the surge and
degassing tanks is equalized by a line (997) which
interconnects the gas spaces in the two tanks. An air
purge is maintained through the two tanks and out the

”

degassing tank vent. This purge rate is determined by a
pressure regulator (PCV-996A), which obtains its sup-
ply from the component cooling air system, by air
orifice FE-996C, located downstream from the regula-
tor, and by a small hand-controlled throttling valve in
the degassing tank vent line, These control elements
also determine the air pressure in the surge tank, which
is the base reference pressure for the treated water
system and therefore affects all pressures in the system.
Pressure switch PS-996-B1 monitors this pressure and
initiates an alarm in the main control room if it is too
high. Pressure switches PS-997A1 and A2 monitor the
pressure in the degassing tank, which is normally the
same as that in the surge tank, and initiate an alarm in
the control room if it is too high or too low.

Three radiation detectors (RE-827 A, B, and C)
monitor the cooling water returning from components
located inside the reactor and drain cell containment
and initiate closure of block valves in all cooling water
lines penetrating reactor and drain cell containment and
in all treated water system vent lines when the radiation
level is high. Signals from the detectors are input to
three ORNL model Q-1916 radiation monitors located
in the auxiliary control room (sce Sect. 4.8.3.7). These
monitors provide an indication of radiation levels in the
control room and provide switch actions for alarm and
control purposes. The monitors also provide a millivolt
level signal, proportional to radiation level, which is
input to the data logger. The alarm switches operate a
common annunciator in the control room when the
radiation level is high. The control switches operate
safety circuit relays whose contacts are connected in
several two-out-of-three logic matrices which control
the block valves. The use of three channels and the
matrices permits failure or testing of one channel during
operation without overriding protection from the other
channels (see Sect. 1.5.4.4, Part 1A).

This arrangement was used because closure of the
cooling water block valves will initiate a chain of events
which will result in a reactor shutdown and drain.

The matrices also operate a block valve (FSV-844A1)
in the thermal shield inlet line when the block valve in
the return line from the thermal shield is closed. This
was done to prevent possible overpressurizing of the
thermal shield, which might occur if the reducing
regulator (PCV-844C) was defective or improperly set.

The positions of all pheumatically operated block
valves are detected by switches which operate indicator
lamps on the main control board.

" Temperatures of cooling water to and from-all reactor -
system components served by the treated water system
are measured with thermocouples installed in wells in
 

 

 

the piping, outside containment. Signals from these
thermocouples are input to the data logger, where they
are used-in heat balance calculations. Since the tempera-
ture ‘of all inlet cooling water is the same, one
thermocouple located at the outlet of the treated water
cooler was sufficient for this purpose.

-‘Temperatures at the inlet and outlet of -the treated
water cooler are measured and indicated locally by dial
indicators installed in wells.

25

Water level in the nuclear instrument penetration is -

indicated locally. Low level is detected by a float-type
switch which indirectly operates the common annun-
ciator in the main control room via a Rochester alarm
unit located in the auxiliary control room.

3.9 LlQUlD_WASTE SYSTEM

The liquid waste system is shown in Fig. 3.9.0. This
system consists of the liquid waste storage tank, the
waste pump, and waste filter. Also shown is the sump
level measuring and jetting system for all cells in the
building. The parameters measured in this system are:

1. pressure,
2. level,
3. flow.

3.9.1 Pressure

The discharge pressures of the waste pump. and of the
pit pump are indicated by line-mounted pressure gages
PI-305A and 326A.

The 100-psig air supply to-the reactor and dram tank
cell jets is reduced and regulated by pressure regulator
PCV-332A. A gage (PI-332B) located downstream from
the regulator indicates the regulated line pressure. The
- supply pressure of the steam to the storage and spare

cells is indicated locally on line-mounted gage PI-315B.

-3.9.2 Level

The level in the pump room sump is eontrolled by
float swrtches LS-PRS-A and B, which automatically
operate the pump room sump pumps. An alternate
system exists in the coolant drain cell sump, whlch is
approxrmately the same level and is connected to the
pump room sump. The level in this sump 1s controlled
by a steam jet which is operated by solenoid valve
LCV-PRS-C. A float switch (LS-PRS- C1) in the coolant
cell sump controls the solenoid valve and, via the
control circuits, initiates an alarm in the main control
room when the jet is operated.

The level in the pump room tank (a 55-gal drum into

which radioactive waste may be dumped) is monitored
by a float switch (LS-PRT-A) which operates a common
waste system annunciator in the main control room via
a Rochester alarm unit (LA-PRT) located in the
auxiliary control room. The contents of this tank may
be pumped to either the waste tank or to the catch
basin at White Oak Creek by manually operating the pit
pump.
_ The sump level in the reactor cell is measured by
means of a weld-sealed pneumatic differential pressure
transmitter (LT-RC-C) and a dip-tube-type bubbler
system supplied from nitrogen cylinders. The output
from the transmitter operates an indicator (LI-RC-C)
and a switch (LS-RC-C) in the transmitter room. High
level in the reactor sump causes the switch to operate a
Rochester alarm unit (LA-RC-C) which, in turn, oper-
ates the common waste annunciator in the control
room. |

The sump level in the drain tank cell is also measured
by a bubbler ‘system. Except for the application
numbers assigned, this system is identical to the reactor
cell sump bubbler system. A second measurement of
drain tank cell sump level is made by means of a
conductrvrty-type spark plug probe (LT-DTC-B) in the
sump. High level in the sump results in an increase in
electrical conductivity between the probe and the sump
wall and operates a magnetic-amplifier-type switching
device (LS-DTC-B) which, in turn, operates the reactor
cell sump level alarm unit (LA-DTC-A) and the com-

‘mon waste system annunciator in the control room.

" The level in the waste tank is measured with a
weld-sealed electric differential pressure transmitter
(LT-WT-A) and a bubbler-type dip tube. The output
from the transmitter operates an indicator (LI-WT-A) in

~ the control room and is retransmitted to the central

waste monitoring station at ORNL. The transmitter
amplifier (LM WToA) is remotely located in the trans-
mitter room.

The level i in all other sumps is measured by a common
manometer (LI- FSC-A) located in the transnutter room. .
Valving the bubbler-type dip leg provrdes for the
selection of which system is to be. monitored by the
manometer, Each system has a switch which initiates an
alarm in the control room on high level. For example,
switch LS-FSC-A, on the spent fuel storage cell bub-

- blers, ‘operates a Rochester alarm unit which, in turn,

operates. the common waste system annunciator in the
control room. Each sump has a jet_ which can be valved
in to empty the sump to the waste tank The reactor
and drain tank sumps are atr-operated All other cells
have steam-operated jets. Saunders-type block valves

 
 

 

 

(FCV-333-Al, A2, A3, and A4), installed in the lines
between the jets and the waste tank, close in response
to a signal from the containment safety circuits and
prevent possible escape of highly radioactive materials
from the reactor cell to the waste system in the event of
high pressure or radioactivity in the reactor cell.

3.9.3 Flow

‘The flow to each bubbler-type dip leg is measured by
a small purge-type rotameter. A constant differential
pressure-type regulator across each purge rotameter
ensures constant flow to the dip leg regardless of
variations in either supply or cell pressure. For example,
purge flow to the reactor cell is measured by rotameter
FI-RC-C!1 and controlled by flow controller FC-RC-C1.
Except for the application number assigned, the purge
flow instrumentation for all other sump bubblers in the
waste system is the same.

3.10 VAPOR CONDENSING SYSTEM

The vapor condensing system is shown in Fig. 3.10.
This system, which consists of an 1800-ft> vertical
condensing tank (VT1) and a 3900-ft? gas retention
tank (VT?2), is separated from the reactor cell by two
rupture disks and is vented through filters to the
containment stack.

This system is installed for use as a steam condenser
and volume expansion system to prevent overpressure
in the reactor containment cell in the event of rupture
of the fuel piping and water piping, which would
generate large quantities of steam. The vertical tank is
normally about two-thirds full of water. Since the water
is necessary, no means are provided to drain the water
from the tank.

Pressure in the system is measured by a compound
gage (PI-VT1-D) locally mounted at an alarm panel
adjacent to the horizontal gas retention tank. A
pressure switch (PS-VT1-C) initiates an alarm at a local
annunciator when pressure in the tank is excessive.

Temperatures of the water and in the vapor space are
measured by sheathed thermocouples TE-VTI and 2,
which are installed in wells. Signals from the thermo-
couples are read out on the data logger. 7

Two level detectors measure the water level in the
vertical vapor condensing tank. The first is a dip tube
bubbler type with purge gas supplied from the normal
nitrogen supply (see Sect. 3.14.1). The bubbler purge
rate is determined by flow controller FC-VT1-E and is
displayed on an integrally mounted gage (FI-VT1-E). A
solenoid valve (ESV-VT1-F) blocks the purge line in the

event of high pressure or radiation in the reactor cell.
This action is initiated by the containment safety
circuits (see Sect. 4.8.1). The pressure of the dip tube is
sensed by a pneumatic differential pressure transmitter
(LT-VT1-A). The 3- to 15-psig output signal from this
transmitter is indicated on a locally mounted gage.

The second system is a series of magnet-reed switches
operated by floats restrained on a vertical rod and
located so that two switches (LS-VT1-B3 and B4) are
above normal water level and two (LS-VT1-B1 and B2)
are below normal level. Each switch operates a local
annunciator which, in turn, and together with pressure
annunciator PA-VT1-C, operates a common annunci-
ator in the control room. L

There are no automatic control actions taken from
either the level or pressure measurements made in this
system. A hand valve in parallel with the rupture disk
allows this system to be pressurized with the reactor
cell during containment integrity tests. A

3.11 CONTAINMENT VENTILATION SYSTEM

The MSRE containment systems serve to protect the
public, the operating personnel, and plant equipment
from exposures to large amounts of radioactivity and
other hazardous materials. The systems must be ade-
quate to prevent escape of these materials to sur-
rounding areas during operations and maintenance and
in the event of any credible accident (see Analysis of
Hazards, Part V). These requirements are met by
providing at least two independent containment barriers
between hazardous materials and the surrounding
atmosphere (see Sect. 1.2.3.1).

During operation of the MSRE, the fuel system pipe
and equipment walls form the primary barrier. The fuel
system is enclosed in the reactor and drain tank cells,
which form the secondary barrier. These cells are
normally operated at subatmospheric pressure to assure
inleakage. -

The third containment barrier, controlled ventilation,
is provided for all areas that surround the secondary
containment barrier. The containment ventilation sys-
tem provides a continuous and controlled flow of air

through all areas where radioactive or beryllium con-

tamination is likely to occur. Such areas include the
high-bay enclosure, the reactor and drain tank cells
(during maintenance), the six smaller special purpose
cells, the electric service areas, transmitter room, service
tunnel, special equipment room, coolant cell, vent
house, and charcoal bed cell. The general arrangement
of Building 7503 is shown in Figs. 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5,

i
 

Sect. 4, Part L. The design and operating characteristics
of the ventilating system are described in Sect. 13, Part
I..The instrumentation and controls for the system are
described here.

Instrumentation is apphed as shown in Flgs 3.11.1
and 3.11.2, which combine to form a simplified version
of ORNIL drawing D- AAB-40515 Contamment Air
Instrument Application Diagram. Either of two

27

21,000-cfm (normal capacity) centrifugal fans, located

outside of the reactor .building near the base of a
100-ft-high stack (see Fig. 3.2, Sect. 3, Part 1) is utilized
to induce air flow through the various containment
areas. Air is withdrawn from the enclosed areas through
one of two main exhaust ducts, lines 927 and 930, and
passed through a bank of CWS filters before discharge
to atmosphere from the 100-ft-high stack. Some en-
closed areas receive air directly from the outside
atmosphere, but the major portion enters the high-bay
area through the inlet filter house. In general, the flow
of air is from the north end of Building 7503 toward
the exhaust stack at the south end and progresses from
the less hazardous to the potentially more hazardous
areas. The ventilated areas are operated at less than
atmospheric pressure, and the primary concern is for
maintaining this negative pressure rather than for
ventilating at an established flow rate. The range of
acceptable flow rates is rather broad for most areas (see
Table 13.1, Part I).

For convenience - the . ventllatlon system may be '

divided into four main parts the contained areas and
connecting ducts, the filters, the fans, and the stack.
The instrumentation and control systems for each of
these parts are discussed in the following sections.

3.11.1 Contained Areas and Connecting Duets '

; During normal operatnons the reactor and dram tank
cells are sealed, and the bulk of the air in the hlgh-bay

area (12,000 to 15,000 cfm) is exhausted through line
935, which has two openings near the sampler-enricher
at the southeast corner of the area (see Fig. 3.11.1). A
remote-operated, motorized damper,® HCV- 935A, per-
mits regulation of . the total air flow. During mainte-
nance operations, the two - series-connected valves,
HCV-930A and HCV-930B, are opened, and the cell
roof plugs and seals are removed The air from the
high- bay, area then flows into the reactor cell and is
exhausted. through a 30-in.-diam duct, line 930. Al-
though lme 930 has the capacity to handle 15 OOO_efm
of air flow, the openings used for maintenance are
usually small, and the bulk of the air will continue to be
withdrawn through line 935.

 

Two series-connected valves are used in line 930 to
satisfy secondary containment requirements when the
reactor cell is sealed. The two valves are mounted close
together in line 930 where it passes through the south
end of the service tunnel. Both are wafer-type butterfly
valves with resilient seats and motorized operators.?
'I'he rated operating pressure for each valve body is 50
psig at 200°F. The shaft seal is designed to permit inert
gas purging at pressures to 50 psig. The total leak rate
through the stuffing box to ambient and across the seat
when 50 psig pressure is applied to one side of the valve
is less than 0.0001 lb/min. The valves are tested for
leaks periodically by pressurizing the short space in the
line between them with air.

The operators on both butterfly valves and on the
ventilation damper HCV-935 are speed reduction gear
boxes driven by electric motors. Each motor is not-
mally operated by two identical sets of pushbutton
switches and position indicator lamps, one set mounted
locally and one mounted on MB3 in the main control
room. The motor control circuits (No. 565, 566, and
567) are described in Sect. 4.8.6.2. A handwheel on
each gear box provides a means for manual operation.
Operational limits are automatically imposed by two
limit switches on each gear box. A geared rotary drum
sw:tch governs valve disk travel and energizes the
position indicator lights on both the opening and
closing directions of valve stem travel. A torque-
actuated sw1tch also governs valve ‘disk travel in both
dlrectlons and prevents torque overload damage by
limiting the amount of thrust exerted on the valve disk
when seating or when moving against some obstructlon
in the line.

Air enters the lugh bay area through the inlet air filter
house at a rate between 14,000 and 17,000 cfm. It
passes through a dust filter having a pressure drop
(when clean) of about 0.028 in. H, 0. A bypass damper
in the side of the house is counterweighted to open if
the negative pressure downstream from the dust filter
exceeds 0.35 in. H,O. This assures an adequate supply

of air should the filters become plugged. The air is

delivered to the high-bay enclosure through duct 953. A
manual damper in this line permits adjustment of the
negative pressure in the enclosure. Another counter-
weighted damper in bypass duct 954 opens auto-
maticall'y'at‘ a negative pressure of 0.45 in: H, 0. This
prevents excessively low pressures Wthh could collapse

the high-bay enclosure.

The operating pressure in the high-bay area is some
value between 0.1 and 0.3 in. H,0 referenced to
atmosphere. This pressure is detectéd by differential
pressure transmitter PT-HB-A,® which transmits a pneu-

 
 

 

 

matic signal proportional to pressure to indicator?
PI-HB-A, to two pressure-actuated switches,’ PS-HB-Al
and A2, and a signal modifier,® PM-HB-A, all mounted
on auxiliary board AB17 in the auxiliary control room.
The two pressure switches initiate an alarm when the
high-bay pressure is too high (>0.1 in. H; O negative) or
too low (<0.3 in. H,O negative). The signal modifier
PM-HB-A converts the pneumatic signal to an equiva-
lent millivolt signal which is transmitted to the com-
puter data logger. Differential pressure transmitter
PT-HB-A is mounted on containment air panel CAP-28
in the high-bay area. The locations of CAP-2 and other
containment air system instrumentation components
are shown on ORNL drawing E-HH-Z-59565.°

A small volume of air also leaves the high-bay
enclosure through six small cells which have openings in
the floor of the enclosure. The air enters the cells
through the unsealed spaces between the concrete
blocks covering the openings and is exhausted by ducts
940 through 946 (Fig. 3.11.1). A manually adjustable
damper in each duct is used to regulate the air flow and
pressure in each cell. The cells are always maintained at
pressures lower than the pressure in the high-bay area.
Draft pressure gages,'® mounted on CAP-2, indicate
pressures in the individual ducts.

Flow element FE940B in duct 940 is a flat plate
orifice! ! which measures the flow rate of the air leaving
the fuel processing cell. The bypass damper remains

open when the fuel processing system is not in

operation. The damper is closed when fuel is processed,
and all of the cell exhaust air passes through FE-940B.
When fuel is processed, the resulting off-gas, which
contains hydrogen, is discharged into duct 940. As long
as sufficient air flow is maintained, the hydrogen
concentration will remain low and the mixture will not
become explosive. The pressure drop across the orifice
is measured by differential pressure transmitter®
FT-940B, which transmits a pneumatic signal propor-
tional to flow rate to flow indicator® FI-940B and to
pressure-actuated switches® FS-940B1 and B2, all
mounted on panel CAP-2. Switch FS-940B2 operates
on low flow in control circuit 120 (see Sect. 4.2.4.2) to
close fuel storage tank vent valve HCV-692Al. Switch
FS-949B1 opens on low flow to initiate an alarm in the
main control room. The sodium fluoride absorber
(SFA) and the process instrument racks (CP3) con-

28

tainment enclosures are extensions of the fuel proc-

essing cell. The instrument enclosure is connected
directly to the cell by duct 979. The SFA enclosure is
evacuated through duct 978 by a small booster fan
which discharges into the cell. Both are operated at
pressures less than the pressure in the high-bay en-

closure. Draft pressures in the enclosures are indicated
by gages'® PI-SFA-C and PI-CP3-B mounted on the
west wall of the high-bay area near the two enclosures.
If the temperature rises above 1.0 in. H, O negative,
switches' 2 PS-SFA-C1 and PS-CP3-Bl initiate alarms
on the fuel processing system control panels, CP1 and
CP2, in the high-bay area (see Sect. 3.13).

Gases vented from the waste storage tank (WT) in the
liquid-waste cell are exhausted through a 6-in. pipe, line
948, to a booster blower in the adjoining remote
maintenance pump cell; this location makes the blower
more accessible for maintenance. The blower discharges
waste tank off-gas, which may at times be radioactive,
directly into exhaust duct 945. This prevents the off-
gas from entering the remote maintenance cell, which
is open to the high-bay area a major portion of the
time. Control circuit interlocks stop the blower if
exhaust air flow to the stack fans is lost.

‘Duct 937 exhausts the transmitter room and the
electrical service areas adjacent to the reactor and
drain tank cells. Outside air enters the transmitter
room and flows into the electrical service areas
where it enters duct 937. The transmitter room is
always maintained at a lower pressure than the
electrical service areas. Draft pressure gages'®
P41937-A and P41938-A, mounted on the east
wall of the transmitter room, indicate the differ-
ences in pressure existing between the transmitter
room and the electrical service areas and between
the transmitter room and the 840-ft level of
Building 7503.

Ducts 937 and 940 through 946 combine to form a
large manifold, duct 936, which is connected to main
exhaust duct 927 by duct 928. Exhaust flow from these
areas is assured as long as the manifold operates at a
negative pressure with reference to the high-bay area. If
this difference is less than 1.0 in. H,0, pressure
switch!? P4S-936-A operates to sound an alarm in the
auxiliary control room.

Draft pressure gages'® PI-SER-B P41-933, P4I-ST-A,
Pyl-VH-A, and PI950-A indicate negative pressures
existing in the special equipment room (SER), the
coolant cell (CC), the service room and tunnel (SR and
ST), the vent house (VH), and the charcoal bed
enclosure. Gages connected to the special equipment
room and the coolant cell are mounted together in a
small panel on the south wall of the high-bay area;
those connected to the service room and tunnel are
mounted on the wall of the service room, and the gages
connected to the vent house and charcoal bed en-
closures are mounted outside the vent house on the
south wall. Pressures indicated for the special equip-
 

 

 

ment room, the service room and-tunnel, the vent
house, and the charcoal bed enclosure are all referenced
to atmosphere. The pressure indicated for the coolant
cell is referenced ‘to the high-bay area. The range of
negative pressures existing in these areas varies from 0.1
to 2 in. H, 0.

Radioactivity levels are monitored in the fuel proc-
essing system instrument enclosure (CP3), the reactor
and drain tank cells, and the coolant cell. The CP3
enclosure is monitored by process radiation detector
RE-CP3-A, which transmits an electrical signal to
RM-CP3-A on fuel processing control panel CP2.
RM-CP3-A modifies the signal to operate an integrally
mounted indicator RI-CP3-Al and limit switch contact
RS-CP3-Al. The switch contact opens when the radio-
activity level exceeds the desired limit and actuates the

annunciator on panel CP1. Detector RE-CP3-A is an

Anton 106C G-M tube, and RM-CP3-A is an ORNL
Q-1916 logarithmic response gamma radiation monitor.
Both components are described in Sect. 2.10.

The reactor cell, drain tank cell, and the coolant celi
are monitored by radiation detectors RE-6005-1
through 3, RE-6000-1 through 3, and RE-6010. The six

elements in the reactor and drain tank cells are

connected to electrometer RM-6000 through a six-
position selector switch, HS-6000. Element RE-6010 in
- the coolant cell is connected directly to electrometer
RM-6010. The selector switch and both electrometers
are mounted on nuclear panel NP3 in the auxiliary
control room. The electrometers operate indicators
only and are not equipped with alarm or control
interlock contacts. Section 2.10 gives a complete
description of these systems. -

3.11.2 Containment Air Fllters '

Air leaves the contained areas through main exhaust
ducts 927 and 930, where it is passed through a bank of
filters before discharge from the 100-ft-high stack. The
filter pit, the fans, and the stack are all located
immediately south of Building 7503.° The instrumen-
tation for the filter bank and the fans is mounted in a
weatherproof panel, CAP-1,!% located near the filter
pit. The air lines serving mstruments mounted on the
stack also pass through this panel.

The filter bank consists of three parallel sections, each
section having a prefilter unit (sometimes referred to as
a roughing filter) followed by an absolute filter unit.
Manually operated dampers are prov:ded at the inlet
and outlet of each section.

- QOver a period of time the filters become dlrty and
reduce the total flow of air below the required

minimum of 20,000 scfm. The filters must be replaced
before this occurs. The condition of the filters is
determined by measuring the pressure drop across the
entire bank and across each filter unit in the pits. Six
draft pressure gages,'® connected to the pit through
manifold valves and ¥-in.-OD copper tubes, indicate
pressure drops across individual filter units as shown in
Fig. 3.11.2. The arrangement of gages P4I-F1-Al and
P41-F1-A2 on filter section F1 is typical for all three
sections. The pressure drop across both units in a
section varies from 1.6 in. H, O when the filters are
clean to 4.8 in. H,O when the filters are dirty.
P41-F1-Al and P4I-F1-A2 have measuring ranges of O to
8 in. H, O and 0 to 2 in. H, O differential pressure.

The total pressure drop across the filter bank,
including the inlet and outlet dampers, is monitored by
ECI (see Sect. 5.2.24) differential pressure trans-
mitter! > P4T-927B and differential pressure switch'?
P4S927B. PyT-927B transmits an electrical signal
proportional to differential pressure to two indi-
cators,' 5 P41-927-B1 on panel CAP-1 and P41-927-B2
on auxiliary board ABI in the auxiliary control room.
The measuring range of the system is 0 to 10 in. H,O.
P4S927-B operates annunciator P3A-927-B in the
auxiliary control room if the differential pressure
exceeds the desired limit. This can vary from 5.5 to 8
in. H, 0, dependmg on the length of time the filters are
used.

The tubing connections between the filter pits and
the instruments were made with considerable care to
avoid conditions which might cause large measurement
errors. The tubes are all %-in. OD and are installed with
a continuous downward slope from panel CAP-1 to the
pits. This allows condensed moisture to drain out rather
than collect in traps where it can produce errors by
freezing or by manometer action.

3.11.3 -Stack Fans

It is important to maintain a continuous flow of air
through the contained areas (see Part V, Sect. 6.1,
Reactor Safety Analysis). For this reason two .exhaust
fans, SF1 and SF2, are provided as shown in Fig.
3.11.2. Either one of the two fans may be used to
exhaust the contiinment enclosures, but for normal
operations fan SF1 is run continuously, with fan SF2 in
a standby condition. If for any reason the flow stops or
is significantly reduced, pressure switches'2 PS-927Al
and A2 operate in control circuits No. 254 and No. 526
(see Sect. 4.8.4.1) to automatically start standby fan
SF2 and shut down fan SF1. This action is annunciated
in the auxiliary control room (see circuit 891, Fig.

 

 
 

 

 

 

4.1.53). Although the operator may choose to run
either fan, the automatic switching feature is available
only if SF1 is running and SF2 is placed in the
automatic control mode.

For normal operating conditions the air flow varies
from the maximum rate of 28,000 scfm, when the
filters are clean and the static pressure at the fan inlet is
5.5 in. H, O negative, to the minimum rate of 21,000
scfm when the static pressure at the fan inlet is 10.0 in.
H; O negative. When the filters are clean, the pressure
upstream from the filter pits, as indicated by gage'®
PI-927-Al, is approximately 4.0 in. H, O negative. This
pressure rises toward zero as flow is reduced. When it
reaches 1.0 in. H, O negative, switches PS-927A1 and
A2 open to switch the fans.

The fan discharge dampers, FCO-925A and
FCO-926A, are operated by the electrical control cir-
cuits described in Sect. 4.84.1. Each damper is
equipped with a pneumatic diaphragm-type spring-
loaded operator? connected to the damper blades by a
lever mechanism. When SF1 is running, the three-way
solenoid valves, FCV-925A and FCV-925B, are both
energized, and air pressure is applied to operators
FCO925A and FCO-926A. With pressure applied to
both operators the SF1 discharge damper FCO-925A is
open and SF2 discharge damper FCO-926A is closed.
When the control circuits switch the operation from fan
SF1 to SF2, the solenoids deenergize and vent the
damper operators; SF2 discharge damper FCO-926A
opens and FCO-925A closes to prevent backflow
through fan SF1.

The solenoid valves FCV-925A1 and FCV-926Al1 are
located near the fans and connected to terminals in
containment air panel CAP-1. Switches PS-927A1 and
A2 and pressure gage PI-927A are also located in panel
CAP-1.

3.11.4 Containment Air Stack

A Pitot tube,!” FE-S1-A, connected to differential
pressure transmitter® FT-S1-A continuously monitors
the total air flow through the containment air stack.
Both instruments are mounted on the stack at the 40-ft
level.® At the full scale flow rate of 30,000 scfm the
Pitot tube produces approximately 1.13 in. H,O
differential pressure’® which is converted by the
transmitter to a proportional 3- to 15-psig pneumatic
output signal. This signal operates flow indicator'®
FI-Si-A, flow switch® FS-Si-A, and signal modifier®
FM-S1-A, all mounted on control board MB3 in the
main control room. F1-S81-A is a vertical strip-type
indicator with a square root scale calibrated to read

30

directly in percent of full scale volume flow rate. Flow
switch FS-S1-A opens when the flow rate falls below
20,000 scfm and operates annunciator FA-S1-A (see
circuit 890, Fig. 4.1.53) in the auxiliary control room.
Signal modifier FM-S1-A converts the pneumatic signal
to a proportional millivolt signal, which is recorded by
the computer data loggér (see Sect. 2.12). _

Air from the contained areas is monitored for excess
radioactivity as it passes through the stack by radiation
detection elements RE-S1-A, RE-S1-B, and RE-S1-C.
Electrical signals proportional to the activity levels are
transmitted to indicating, recording, and alarm instru-
ments on nuclear board NP5 in the auxiliary control
room and to the computer data logger. These instru-
ments are fully described in Sect. 2.11.

3.12 SAMPLING AND ENRICHING SYSTEMS

Instrumentation is provided to control the operation
of the sampling and enriching systems of the MSRE.
The experimental facility provides one system for
sampling, enriching, and poisoning the fuel salt,'?
another system for sampling the coolant salt,'** and a
third system for sampling fuel salt in the processing
plant.2>> The most pressing problem of the sampler-
enricher for the fuel salt is to maintain a minimum of
two barriers against the escape of radioactive gases or
particulates. The quantities of activity that can be
released by the other two systems are much lower;
consequently, the instrumentation requirements are less
stringent for the coolant-salt sampler and the fuel

‘processing sampler.

3.12.1. Fuel Salt Sampler-Enricher

A schematic diagram of the fuel salt sampler-enricher
system is shown in Fig. 3.12.1 A. The system consists of
a transfer tube connecting the pump bowl through two
gate valves to a leak-tight two-chambered shielded
transfer box on the operating floor. The sample transfer
tube passes through both the primary and secondary
containment barriers in the MSRE. Sampling or en-
riching is accomplished by raising or lowering the
capsule while alternately opening and closing barriers

~and purging the exposed volumes to the off-gas system.

3.12.1.1 General instrumentation requirements. As

shown in Fig. 3.12.1B, a helium buffer and leak

detection system is provided for mechanical seals and
valves. Miniature strain gage pressure transducers are
connected to the buffer lines to the primary con-
tainment areas and barrier seals. These transducers
provide signals to be used by electronic Consotrol
instrumentation ¢ECI) to operate and control the
barrier closure operators and solenoid valves in the

- off-gas and containment lines. Electrical interlocks and

alarms are provided to ensure that there are always two
or more independent barriers against the release of
activity. In some cases these barriers consist of two or -

“more block valves. In other cases the barriers consist of

one block valve and at least one fixed barrier, such as a

_ pipe or vessel wall. Care was taken in the design to

ensure that the protective interlocks were truly inde-
pendent of the “protected failure,” that is, that the
mechanism which caused the failure of a containment
barrier could not also cause failure of the protective
interlocks. To further ensure that a single failure will
not cause loss of protection, all instrumentation and
control circuitry associated with the containment of
radioactive particles and gases are designed and installed

 

 
 

 

 

 

32

in accordance with the practices established at ORNL

for the design and installation of reactor protective
systems. Such systems are designated as being “safety
grade,” as distinguished from the “control grade”
systems used for routine control and equipment pro-
tective operations, and employ the principle of redun-
dancy separation (isolation) and identification. The
safety channels in the sampler-enricher use one-out-of-
two logic; that is, two separate and independent
channels are provided for each measured variable, either
of which will produce the required protective action.
Although only two channels are required to obtain the
required redundancy for a given protective action, three
safety channels were required in the sampler-enricher.
The extra channel was required because three barriers
exist in the sampler-enricher, any two of which serve as
a redundant barrier when the third barrier is opened to
insert or remove the sample capsule. The three safety
channels are, therefore, mutually redundant and are
designed to prevent intentional opening of one barrier
unless the other barriers are intact.

The requirements for containment of radioactive
‘materials and for exclusion of oxygen from the con-
tained area dictated a high degree of leak-tightness in
the containment barriers and in all instrument com-
ponents that are connected to and form a part of these
barriers. Since the capsule access chamber is connected
directly to the reactor pump bowl during certain stages
of sampling or enriching operations, the walls of this
chamber, and of the piping, valves, or instrument
components connected to the chamber (or to the line
between the chamber and the reactor), are considered
to be part of the reactor primary containment and are
required to leak less than 1078 std cc of helium per
second. All instrument components in this category
have weldsealed construction with autoclave-type or
welded connections. Specifically, these components
include strain-gage-type pressure elements, solenoid
valves, and the associated instrument tubing. All sole-
noid valves used as containment blocks in the safety
system are specially constructed valves having a speci-
fied leakage through the seat of less than 107 cc of
helium per second when helium at 50 psig is applied at
either end connection and the other end is evacuated to
less than 10~ mm Hg absolute pressure. Some of these
solenoid valves are required to operate under vacuum
conditions during certain stages of sampler operation,
and, consequently, relatively large port openings are
required to obtain reasonable evacuation times. Since
the port size requirements are in direct conflict with the
shutoff requirements, these components were specially
designed and procured for the service. Further dis-

cussion of the special strain gage pressure transmitters
and solenoid valves is given in Sect. 6 of this report.

A lesser degree of leak-tightness is required of the
instrument components that are connected to and form
a part of the secondary containment barriers. Although
these components are required to have a high degree of
helium leak-tightness, gasketed construction and
threaded or gasketed connections are permitted. How-
ever, in some cases, considerations of operational
requirements andfor cost dictated the use of com-
ponents in the secondary system having a quality
equivalent to that required for the primary containment
system. Three control and two relay panels are provided
to house and separate the control- and safety-grade
instruments. Figure 3.12.1C shows the sampler-enricher
and control panels in place at the reactor site during
preoperational testing.

3.12.1.2 Helium system. Helium is supplied at 250
psig through line 509 to control panel No. 1,* where it
is reduced in pressure to 80 psig and 40 psig by pressure
regulators PV-650A and PV-509B respectively. The
250-psig line, the leak detector headers, and the buffer
header are %,-in. sched 40 pipe. All other helium lines
are '4-in.-OD autoclave tubing with 30,000-Ib autoclave
fittings. Low pressure on the 250-psig line is detected
by pressure switch PS509A and indicated by annunci-
ator PASO9A on panel No. 1.

The 80-psig helium is supplied in line 650 through
flow restrictor FE-650D to three-way solenoid valves
HSV-651 A, HSV-652A, and HSV-653A. These valves
supply helium to the pneumatic clamps which open and
close the capsule access chamber door. Valve
HSV-652A supplies the three clamps on the hinged side
of the door to close the door, followed after a 15sec
delay by HSV-653A, which supplies helium pressure to
the three clamps on the opposite side to clamp the door
closed. HSV-651 A supplies helium to the reverse side of
the piston, swinging the clamps out of the way and
permitting the door to open by spring action. The spent
helium is vented through the three-way valves and line
675 to the containment air system. Pressure on line 650
is indicated by PI-650B on panel No. 1. The line is
protected against overpressure by a rupture disk and
relief valve which discharge to the containment air
system. An excess flow valve (FE-650C) connected in
parallel with the relief valve prevents buildup of

 

*Unless otherwise stated, panel numbers referred to in Sect.
3.12.1 are preceded by SE on drawings and other documenta-
tion; for example, sampler-enricher panel No. 1 is panel SE-1.
Similarly, panel No. 1 in Sect. 3.12.2 is fuel processing sampler
panel PS-1, and panel No. 1 in Sect. 3.12.3 is coolant-salt
sampler panel CS-1.
 

 

 

 

pressure downstream of the rupture disk from small
leakage flows through the disk. Failure of the rupture
disk is detected by pressure switch PS-650C and
indicated by annunciator PA650A on panel No. 1.

- The 40-psig helium through line 509 supplies the
remainder of the system, including leak detector
headers, the buffer header, and various other purge and
buffer lines. Pressure on this regulated helium header is
indicated by PI-509C. Low pressure is detected by
pressure switch PS509D and indicated by annunciator
PA509D. Both are located on panel No. 1. This line is

~also protected against overpressure by a rupture disk
and relief valve in branch line 674, which discharges to
the containment air system. Again, failure of the
rupture disk is indicated by an annunciator alarm
PS-674A and PA674A on panel No. 1, and protection is
provided against buildup of pressure downstream from
the rupture disk by excess flow valve FE674A.

The leak detection system is divided into two headers,
No. 1 for those seals considered to be control grade and
No. 2 for those considered to be safety grade. Both

‘headers, with their associated pressure gages and an-
nunciator alarms, are located 'in panel No. 1. The No.
2 header is isolated as far as practical in the lower half
of the panel. (In general, on all three panels the safety-
‘grade instrumentation is located in the lower portion.)
Seals fed from No. 1 header are area 3A; removal valve
flange, illuminator, manipulator, and periscope are area
3A-2B. The safety-grade seals are the operational valve
flange and stem, the maintenance valve flange and stem,
and area 1C. There is a capillary flow restrictor
(FE664A and FE644A) in the supply line to each
header to restrict the flow should a leak develop. If the
header supply valve is closed, a leak in a seal on header
No. 1 will result in a pressure drop, which is detected

by pressure switch PS664B and indicated by an alarm

‘on -annunciator PA664B and a drop in the pressure
‘reading on PI-664B. Similarly, a seal leak on header No.

-2 will be detected and indicated by PS644B, PA644B,

and PI644B. There is a hand valve mounted on the
-panel for each branch line from each header. The valves
are normally open during operation and are used to
determine the location of the leak. o ,

- The buffer header, located on panel No. 3, has branch
lines which pressurize the space between the double
seals of the capsule access chamber daor, the removal
-valve, the operational valve, and the maintenance valve.
Each line has double check valves to prevent backflow

‘of possibly ¢ontaminated gas. Capillary flow restrictors

FE669A, FE6T0A, FEG668A, and FE6SSA restrict flow
and produce a pressure drop when a leak develops or
when the seals are intentionally opened. Strain gage

33

préssure transducers PE669B, PE670B, PE668C, and
PE655C (on each line on the downstream side of the
double check valves) sense the change in pressure which
occurs when a leak develops or a valve is opened and
transmit this change as an electrical signal proportional
to pressure to the electronic Consotrol instrumentation
on panels No. 1 and 2. There the signal is utilized first
as a 0- to 100-psia recording for each valve and the
access door and also, by means of an electronic switch,
to supply electrical interlocks for control and -alarm
purposes. The alarm or open position of each valve and
the ‘access door is indicated by both annunciator alarms
and indicating lights on panel No. 2. Low pressure on

“the buffer header itself is indicated by a separate
‘annunciator alarm on' panel No. 2. Solenoid valves

HSV655B and HSV668B on the buffer lines to the
operational and maintenance valves serve as backup
block ‘valves which are interlocked to close in case of
high radiation in the line or high fuel pump bowl
pressure (see circuit 381, Fig. 3.12.1F). Further infor-
mation on the operation of instrumentation, interlocks,
and alarms associated with the buffer lines is given in

- Sects. 3.12.1.4,,3.12.1.5, and 3.12.1.6 of this report.

The remaining lines served by the 40-psig header are
657, 666, 671, and 672. Each of the lines has its own

panel-mounted hand valve, pressure regulator (PV), and-

~ pressure gage (PI) for individual control and indication.

Line 657, which supplies helium to purge area 1C, is
provided with a flow restrictor (FE657C), double check
valves to prevent backflow, and a solenoid block valve
(HSV657D) which is interlocked to close in case of high
radiation in the line or high fuel pump bowl pressure
(see circuit 381, Fig. 3.12.1F). A strain gage pressure
transducer (PE-IC-E), on the downstream side of the
double check valves, provides a signal to be utilized for
a 0- to 100-psia recording and to obtain electrical
switch action for control interlocks and for high-

~pressure annunciator alarm. The pressure signal for this
area 1C transducer is used in conjunction with a similar

transducer (PE-AR3A) in area 3A to provide a differen-
tial signal to ensure that the capsule access chamber
door cannot be opened unless area 1C pressure is equal

-.t0, or less than, area 3A pressure. Line 666, which

supplies the removal seal buffer, is provided with a
capillary flow restrictor FE666A, an on-off solenoid

valve (HCV666D) with indicating light (ZI666D) to

show when the seal is being pressurized, a pressure
switch (PSS666E) supplying interlocks for control, and

- another indicating light (ZI666E) to show when the seal

pressure is greater than 10 psig. This pressure indicates

‘that the seal is closed, and, due to the restricted flow of

the cover gas, it takes about 10 min to reach 10 psig.
 

 

 

 

34

The indicating lamp and control interlock circuits are

shown in Figs. 3.12.1D and 3.12.1E (circuits 357, 358,
and 375). As can be seen from circuit 375, valve
HCV666D is operated directly by hand switch HS666D
and is not restricted by interlocks. Line 671 runs
directly from the regulator (PV671A) on the panel to
purge the remowval area. Line 672, which supplies the
area 3A purge, has double check valves in it to prevent
backflow. Line 663 connects between these valves and
the panel regulator to permit line 672 to pressurize the
manipulator cover.

3.12.1.3 Ofi-gas system. Off-gas from the transfer

box inner and outer chambers (areas 1C and 3A) is
vented either through or around vacuum pump No. 1 to -

the auxiliary charcoal beds. Lines from either area can
be blocked with two or more valves in series. Area 1C is
vented through line 678, which is provided with
solenoid valve HSV-678A (in area 3A) in series with
air-operated valve HSV-678B1 (in area 3B). The air-
operated valve, because of its good leak-tightness, is
‘used as backup to the solenoid valve. Air is supplied to
HSV-678B1 through solenoid valve HSV-678B2. Area
3A is vented through line 677 and solenoid valve
HSV-677A. Line 677 joins line 678 below HSV-678B1,
and the combined vent line passes radiation detectors
RE-678C and RE-678D before arriving at the vacuum
pump. These radiation detectors provide signals for
electrometers RM678C and RM678D on panel No. 2,
which in turn provide signals for the reactor data logger
and for the high-activity off-gas annunciator alarm
RA678C on panel No. 3. At the inlet to the vacuum
pump, the off-gas can be directed through the pump by
opening solenoid valve HCV678E, or it can be directed
around the pump by opening bypass solenoid valve
'HCV-667A. Normally, the gas would be bypassed
around the pump until the activity decays to a level
that would not be considered harmful to the pump.
Then the pump would be used to evacuate the two
chambers. Should the pump be running with the inlet
valve closed, or should a high outlet pressure develop, a
pressure relief valve is provided to vent around the
pump. Both the pump and the bypass line discharge
through a check valve to line 542, which discharges
through solenoid valve ESV-542A and a hand valve to
the charcoal beds to provide protection against backup
of radioactive gases from the reactor system. Valve
ESV-542A is provided as backup protection for the
check valves and is interlocked to close if a high
- pressure (7 psig) develops in the line or if there is
excessive activity in the sampler containment air system
(see circuit C380, Fig. 3.12.1F). Containment air
activity interlocks are obtained from radiation monitors

RM675A and RM675B, discussed in Sect. 3.12.1.4.
High off-gas system pressure is detected by two pressure

_switches (PSS542B and PSS542C) which provide the

interlock contacts shown in circuits A378 and B378
(Fig. 3.12.1E). Two switches are used to provide the
required safety system redundancy. The hand valve is
for maintenance purposes.

“The on-off hand switches and indicating lights for the
off-gas solenoid valves and vacuum pump are focated on
panel No. 3. As shown in Fig. 3.12.1F, circuit A380,
and Fig. 3.12.1H, switch HS542A must be in the “on”
position before any of ithe valves can be opened. With
HS542A in the “on” position, valve. ESV-542A is
opened if its interlocks are in the permissive state and
will be so indicated by indicating light ZI-542A.
Another switch must be turned on for each of the other
valves before they can be opened. The vacuum pump
inlet and bypass valves, HCV-678E and HCV-667A

(circuits F380 and G380), are energized (opened)

directly by their switches since their circuits do not
contain interlocks. The remaining offgas valves,
HSV-678A, HSV-678B1, and HSV-677A (circuits
D380, A380, and B380), are opened when their

interlocks are in the permissive state and their switches

are in the *“on™ position. To provide protection against
the release of excess radioactivity to the containment
air system, these valves are interlocked to close if there
is excessive radioactivity in the containment air system
(see Sect. 3.12.1.4). o _
To provide further protection against the backup of
activity from the reactor system, valves HSV-677A and
HSV-678A are also interlocked to close in the event of
high pressure in the reactor off-gas system. In general,
these interlocks provide redundant actions to ensure
that two independent barriers exist between the reactor
system and the containment ventilation system, so that
a single failure will not cause a release of high-level
activity. These barriers may consist of two valve

blocking actions or a single valve blocking action or a

fixed barrier such as a pipe or vessel wall. For example,
a release of activity from the reactor through area 1C,
produced by a rupture at the junction of line 677 and
678, is prevented by the redundant blocking action of
HSV678A and HSV678B as well as by the blocking

_action of HSV677A together with the presence of the

area 1C vessel wall. Similarly, protection against backup
of activity from the reactor off-gas system and subse-
quent release through a leak in the manipulator boot or
the area 3A vessel wall is prevented by the redundant
actions of ESV-542A and HSV-677A. Additional
“control grade™ protection against the release of ac-

tivity from the reactor through area 1C is provided by
o ahri et

 

interlocks in circuits A380 and D380, which close (or
prevent opening) valves HSV678B1, HSV677A, and
HSV678A if both the operational valve and the
maintenance valve are open. (Note that interlocks. in
circuits 362 and 365 prevent opening the operational
valve or the maintenance valve if HSV678A is open.)

~ The maintenance and operational ‘“valve closed”
interlocks in circuits A380 and D380 are similar to the
“valve closed and sealed” interlocks discussed in Sect.
3.12.1.5 in that the signal for both is obtained from
measurement of valve buffer pressure. However, as can
be seen from circuits 360, 363, 366, A376, and B376,
the “valve closed” interlocks are set to operate at a
lower pressure than the “valve closed and sealed”
interlocks. The distinction between *“valve closed” and
“valve closed and sealed” was made because the time
requrred for the buffer pressure to build up to a point
where a closed and sealed indication was obtained was
much longer than the time required to obtain a élosed
indication. To avoid the excessive delays in sampler

operations which would have resulted from the use of a

closed and sealed indication, the closed indication was
used for the “control grade” interlocks in circuits A380

and D380.

To prevent damage to the manipulator boot resulting
from "development of excessive differential pressure
across the boot during evacuation of area 3A, valve
HSV-677A is also interlocked to close and.stop evacua-
tion if the pressure in the manipulator boot is 30 in.

35

(water column) greater than the pressure in area 3A.

Excessive differential pressure is detected by differ-
enitial pressure switch P;SS680C (circuit 393), which is
connected between lines 680 and 658. Excessive differ-
ential_"_ pressure also causes an annunciation at the
sampler panel. The open condition for each valve is

‘indicated by individual indicating lights. Another indi-
“cating light, ZIQV-MV-A, is provided to show when
either the operational or maintenance valve is closed

but not completely sealed and the associated interlock
restrictions on the operation of wvalves HSV678A

'HSV678BI, and HSV677A have been cleared.:

‘31214 Containment - air system. The mampulator
boot and cover and the removal area are exhausted
through vacuum pump No. 2 to area 4A. Areas 4A, 2B,

containment air system. All the discharged gas, plus the
buffer lines to the Operatronal and maintenance valves
and to the access port, passes radiation - detectors
RE-675A and RE675B. These detectors provide signals

“for radiation monitors RM675A and RM675B on panel

No. 2, which in turn provide signals for the reactor data
logger, for control interlocks shown in circuits A377

and B377 (Fig. 3.12.1E), and. for the high-activity
containment air annunciator alarm RA 675A on panel
No. 3. Two radiation monitoring channels were. pro-
'vided to satisfy the requirements for redundancy in the
contamment safety system.

The removal area is exhausted through line 679 and
solenoid valve HCV679A to the inlet of the vacuum
pump. The open-close hand switch (HS679A) and
indicating light (ZI1679A) for HCV-679A are on panel
No. 3, and as shown in circuit 383 (Fig. 3.12.1G), the
valve- is interlocked to close on high activity in the
containment air or primary area buffer lines. The
manipulator boot is exhausted through line 682 and the
manipulator cover through line 680. These two lines
join, and the combined line exhausts through solenoid
valve HSV680B to the inlet of the vacuum pump.
HSV-680B does not have an individual control switch,
but is controlled by the same switch (HS668B) that

‘operates the solenoid valves in the primary area buffer

lines (see circuit 381, Fig. 3.12.1F). One indicating
light, ZI-668 B, shows the open-closed position of all the
valves. Also, HSV-680B is interlocked to close on high
fuel pump bowl pressure or high activity in the

containment air or primary area buffer lines.

Vacuum pump No. 2 discharges into area 4A, which is

‘vented through line 684 to line 949 to the containment

air system. Area 3B is vented through line 660 to line
684. Area 2B is vented through line 659 and solenoid
valve HSV659B to area 4A. The open-close hand
switch (HS659B) and indicating light (ZI659B) for
HSV-659B are on panel No. 3, and the valve is
interlocked to close on high activity in the containment
air or primary area buffer lines (see circuit B382, Fig.
3.12.1F). Pressure switch PS659A on line 659 givesa
high-pressure signal for area 2B annuncnator alarm
(PA659A) on panel No. 3. ;

The pneumatic clamps on the capsule access chamber
door are vented through line 675 and air-operated valve

HSV-675A1 to line 949. Air is supplied to HSV-675A1
“through solenoid valve HSV-675A2. The open-close

hand switch. (HS675A) and indicating light (ZI675A)

for HSV-675A1 are on panel No. 3. For convenience in

- closing both valves simultaneously, the hand switch

“and 3B and the access port operator are vented to the

(HS675A) controls both HSV-675A1 and HSV-659B.
HS-675A must therefore be in the “on” position before
HSV659B can be opened (see circuit A382, Fig.
3.12.1F). HSV-675A1 is also interlocked to close on
high ‘activity ‘in the contamment air or primary area

"buffer lines.

- High pressure in area 3A is released through line 658
and a rupture disk to line 675 on the downstream side
of HSV-675A1. High pressures-in the 40-psig helium

 

 
 

 

 

header and the 80-psig access port header are released

through rupture disks to line 949 and to the contain- .

ment air system.

3.12.1.5 Control and operation of motor dnvas and
solenoid valves. The removal valve is opened and closed
by a pneumatic operator. As shown in Fig. 3.12.1B, air
flow to the operator is controlled by solenoid valves
HCV-RV-Al and HCV-RV-A2. The valves are operated
by three-position (open-off<close) hand switch
HS-RV-A on panel No. 2. From circuit 359 (Fig.

3.12.1D) it can be seen that the removal valve is closed

by switch action only; but before it can be opened, the
removal seal, operational valve, maintenance valve, and

access port must be closed. The open-close position of .

the removal valve is shown by indicating lights
ZI-RV-Al and ZI-RV-A2, actuated by limit switches
ZS-RV-Al .and ZS-RV-A2 at the valve (see circuit 361,
Fig. 3.12.1D). The control interlock in circuit 360,
which indicates whether or not the valve is closed and
sealed, is obtained from ECI switch PSS670B, which
receives its signal from pressure transducer PE670B on
the buffer line to the valve (see Sect. 3.12.1.2).

- The operational and maintenance valves are Limi-
torque valves and are operated by three-phase motors.
The motors are controlled with three-phase reversing
starters, with one starter coil in the “open” circuit and
the reverse starter coil in the *“‘close™ circuit, as can be
seen in circuits 362 and 365 (Fig. 3.12.1D). The
starters are mechanically and electrically interlocked to
prevent both forward and reverse being closed simul-
taneously. The “open™ and *‘close” circuits for each
valve are operated by open-off<close hand switches
(HS-OV-A and HS-MV-A) on panel No. 2. The “close”
circuit for each valve is interlocked to prevent {(or stop)
closing if there is a mechanical overload at the valve
(torque switch) or if the capsule cable is inserted 4 in.
or more.. The ‘“open” circuits for each valve are
identical. Before either valve can be opened, the fuel
pump bowl pressure must be less than 10 psig, the
manipulator cover must be on, and the area 1C offgas
valve, access port, and removal valve must all be closed.
Limit switches ZSS-OV-A2 and ZSS-MV-A2 stop (or
prevent starting) the valve motor when the valve is full
open. The open-close position of each valve is shown by
panel-mounted indicating lights (ZI-OV-Al, ZI-OV-A2,
ZI-MV-Al, and ZI-MV-A2) actuated by limit switches
Z8-OV-A3, ZS-0V-AS5, ZS-MV-A3, and ZS-MV-AS at
the valves (see circuits 364, Fig. 3.12.1D, and 367, Fig.
3.12.1E). The control interlocks in circuits 363 and 366
indicate whether or. not the valves are closed and sealed
and are obtained from individual ECI switches
(PSS668C2 and PSS655C2), which receive their signais

' from pressure transducers PE668C and PE655C on the

buffer lines to the valves (see Sect. 3.12.1 2).

The capsule access port, as discussed i in Sect. 3.12.1.2,
is opened and closed by solenoid valves HSV-651A,
HSV-652A, and HSV-653A. The valves are operated by
open-off-close hand switch HS-651 A on panel No. 1.1t
can be seen from circuit 368 (Fig. 3.12.1E) that when
the switch is turned to the “close” position, valve
HSV652A and time delay relay K368 are energized.
The switch must be held in the “close” position for 15
sec until. contact K368A closes, which permits
HSV-653A to be energized and completes the closing
and clamping of the door. Valve HSV-651A can be
energized and the door can be opened if switch
HS-651A is turned to the “open” position, if area 1C
pressure is equal to or less than area 3A pressure, if the
fuel pump bowl pressure is less than 10 psig, if the
operational valve is closed, if the maintenance valve is
closed, and if the removal valve is closed. The control
interlock in circuit 369, which indicates the open-closed
position of the door, is obtained from ECI switch
PSS669B, which in turn receives its signal from pressure
transducer PE669B on the buffer line to the door (see
Sect. 3.12.1.2). There are no position-indicating lights
since the door is under visual observation of the oper-
ator through the periscope. '

The capsule cable drive is a Jordan Shaftrol single-
phase motor with its forward and reverse windings
connected directly in the control circuit (see circuit
370, Fig. 3.12.1E). The motor is operated by three-
position (insert-off-withdraw) hand switch HS-CDA on
panel No. 2. The insert circuit is interlocked so that the
capsule can be inserted only if the operation and
maintenance valves are full open. Lower and upper limit
switches provide interlocks ZSS-CD-Al and ZSS-CD-A2
(circuits 373 and 374) to interrupt the circuits and stop
the motor when the capsule is inserted or withdrawn
approximately 18 ft. These switches also actuate the
panel-mounted position-indicating lights (ZI-CD-A3 and
ZI1-CD-A4, circuit 371). Another limit switch
(ZS-CD-A3, circuit 372) provides a control interlock for
the condition when the cable is inserted 4 in. or more.
Two gear-driven synchro transmitters (ZE-CD-Al and
ZE-CD-A2) are incorporated into the cable drive unit to
drive two synchro receivers (ZI-CD-Al and ZI-CD-A2)
on panel No. 2; these receivers provide indication of the
capsule posmon in feet and inches.

~ Vacuum pumps No. 1 and 2 (cuculté A391 and A392,

Fig. 3.12.1G) are driven by single-phase motors. The

motors are controlled by motor starters and conven-

tional momentary contact push buttons with seal-in. No

interlocks are provided other than motor overload. An
 

 

 

auxiliary relay is provided in each miotor circuit to give
contacts for off-on indicating lights (see circuits B391

37

and B392, Fig. 3.12.1G). The push buttons and

indicating lights are on panel No. 3.

-3.12.1.6_ECI system. The ECI (electromc Consotrol
instrumentation) system is shown in Fig. 3.12.1J. The
origin of the pressure signals for the ECI and the use of
the control interlocks thus obtained have been dis-
cussed in Sects. 3.12.1.2 and 3.12.1.5 of this report.
Various components in the system are described in
Sect. 5.2 of this report. Tabulations and individual
specification of instrument components of the system
are included in the MSRE Instrument Speczﬁcatzons
and Applications Tabulations.’

As can be seen from circuits 639 and 640 in Fig.
3.12.1J, the wiring for instrument safety channels 655,
668, 669, and 670 is identical. In circuit 639, the
direct-current power supply PX-655C and PX-668C
supplies 5 V dc to pressure transducers PE-655C for the
maintenance valve and PE-668C for the operational
valve. The pressure transducers have an output of O to
25 mV dc varying in proportion to a pressure signal of 0
to 100 psia. The transducer output is fed to an
emf-to-current converter, PM-655C1 for instance, where
the 0- to 25-mV dc input is changed to 10- to 50-mA dc
output. This milliampere dc output is fed to dual
'electromc switch PSS-655C1 and PSS-655C2 in series
with resistor PM-655C2. Normally, this milliampere
signal would be fed to electronic switches and recorders
in series as desired. However, safety_requirements for

these circuits require that the recorder be isolated from

the safety circuits. The recorder, due to its maintenance
requirements and panel location for readability, cannot
be considered as safety grade. The output of resistor
PM-655C2 is fed to isolation amplifier PM-655C3, the
output of which is a 10- to S50-mA dc input to one pen
of two-pen recorder PR-655C and PR-668C. =

Circuit 640 (instrument channels AR3A and IC-E)
differs from 639 and 641 in that it is “control grade”
and does not require the resistor and isolation amplifier.
Also, the milliampere output of the converter.for each
half of the circuit is-fed to a differential switch
(P4SS-IC-E and P4S-IC-E), in addition to the individual
electronic switch and the recorder. This differential
switch prowdes control interlocks for pressure differ-
ences between areas 1C and 3A (see Sect. 3.12.1.2).

 

proportional to pump bowl pressure from reactor
transmitters PT-589A and PT592B.

- Shielded cables are used for all the low-voltage signals
between the power supplies, pressure transducers, and
emf-to-current converters. Cable disconnects are pro-
vided at all the transducers,- at transducers PE-655C,
PE-668C, PE-IC-E, and PE-669B where their cables
penetrate the pressure vessel, and outside the shield for
transducers PE-655C and PE-668C to permit the re-
moval of the valve compartment.

3.12.1.7 Process radiation monitors. As discussed in
Sects. 3.12.1.3 and 3.12.14, two sets of radiation
monitoring channels are provided on the sampler-
enricher to provide indications of the presence of excess
activity in the off-gas and containment air systems, to
provide signals required to actuate protective interlocks
and alarms, and for permanent recording of activity
levels on the reactor computer data logger.
" Radiation in the off-gas system is monitored by two
systems, each of which is composed of a Reuter-Stokes
ionization chamber and an E-H Research Laboratories
model 202 electrometer (picoammeter). Radiation in
the containment air system is monitored by two
systems, each of which is composed of an Anton 106C
G-M tube and an ORNL Q-1916 logarithmic response
gamma radiation monitor. Duplicate channels are pro-
vided because of the inaccessible location of the
detectors, and, in the case of the containment air

monitors, to satisfy the reliability and redundancy

requirements of the safety systems.

The Q-1916 monitor is used for monitoring the
containment air activity because of its sensitivity,
operating simplicity, ease of monitor replacement, fast
response, fail-safe features, previous operating history,
and relatively low cost. J 7

The ion-chamber-type monitor is used for monitoring
the off-gas activity because the higher background and
operating activity present in the off-gas lines will at
times exceed the range of the Q-1916 and because the
jon chamber system has the capability of measuring the

' full range of activity levels expected m the off-gas

Electronic switches PSS-589A3 and PSS-592B3 pro-

vide l'ugh fuel pump bowl pressure control interlocks
for use at the sampler-enricher (see cxrcunts A379 and
B379, Fig. 3.12.1F). These switches are connected into
ECI circuits 436 and 439 on auxiliary board No. 7 in
the main control room and receive 10- to 50-mA SIgnals

system.

Both types of monitors are used in other parts of the
reactor systems, and components are mterchangeable
These monitoring systems are described in detail in
Sect. 2.10, Part IIA of this report.

3.12.1.8 lnstrument power, Control power for the
offgas, vent line, and buffer line solenoid valves is fed

~ from the 48-V dc instrument power panel No. 1. This
“dc power is used due to its higher reliability and also

because these high-quality solenoid valves were designed

for dc operation.

 
 

 

 

 

g g

 

-The remaining control and annunciator power is fed
from the 120-V ac single-phase instrument power panel
No. 2, which in turn is fed from the reliable (solid state
inverter) power bus. Control power for operation of the
barrier closures and the capsule cable drive is fed from
instrument power panel No. 2 through a permissive
switch on main board No. 8. This switch must be
turned on before the removal valve, operational valve,
maintenance valve, capsule access port, or capsule cable
drive can be operated. The “‘on” condition is indicated
by a white light on main board No. 8 and by a green

.“power on” light on sampler-enricher panel No. 2.

Three-phase power for the operational and mainte-
nance valve Limitorque motors is fed from the 208-V ac
TV A-diesel instrument power panel No. 5. Single-phase
power for controf -and operation of the vacuum pump
motors is fed from 120-V ac instrument power panel
No. 7. These motors were placed on a less reliable
power source since an outage in their operation could
be tolerated and since the more reliable power sources
were loaded almost to capacity.

Since the radiation instruments and ECI need very
precise regulated power, these instruments were placed
on the regulated 120-V ac single-phase instrument
power panel No. A3.

3.12.1.9 Wiring and containment entrance details.
The wiring of instruments and apparatus, whether on
the control panels or at the sampler-enricher, is the
conventional apparatus-to-terminal-block type of
wiring. Interconnections are made between terminal
blocks. The exceptions to this rule are the cables
between the radiation monitors and the panel meters.
These cables are joined by male and female connectors
at those points where a break is necessary.

The safety-grade terminal blocks at the control
panels, like the safety-grade instruments, are isolated
from control-grade terminal blocks and are located at
the bottom of the panels. The wiring is color coded as
follows: red for safety, blue for ECI (nonsafety), black
for 115-V ac control, white for neutral, green for
ground, and yellow for annunciator. Wiring for ECI,
control, and safety channels Nos. 1,2, and 3 is bundled
separate from each other. Safety channels are separated
from each other as well as from control channels.
Interconnection wiring at the panels is segregated top
and bottom. Safety wiring is in conduits in the base of
the panels. There are separate conduits for ECI safety,
radiation safety, and safety channels Nos. 1, 2, and 3.
Running along the top of the panels are the ECI control
in conduits, the radiation control in conduit, and the

.remaining control wiring in wire ducts. These conduits
and wire ducts interconnect with the relay cabinets and

the junction boxes at the sampler-enricher.

The relay cabinets are mounted on the side of control
panel No. 1. Control-grade relays with their associated
terminal blocks are in the bottom cabinet, and safety-
grade in the top cabinet. The safety relay cabinet is
divided into three compartments, one each for safety
channels Nos. 1, 2, and 3. The dividing partitions have
small holes in them to permit interconnection wiring
between channels. Such interconnections are limited to
hot and neutral power wiring and to wiring required to
form relay contact matrices. No interconnections were
made that would destroy the separation between
redundant safety channels. The motor starters for the
vacuum pumps, operational valve, and maintenance
valve are mounted in the control relay cabinet. Due to
space limitations, it was decided to leave the opera-
tional and maintenance valve starters in the control
relay cabinet, even though they were classified as safety
grade. As a precaution, protective covers marked
“220V, 3-phase, Safety” were placed over the starters
and their associated terminal blocks.

Two junction boxes are provided at the sampler-
enricher to house the terminal blocks for intercon-
necting the control panels and relay cabinets with the
solenoid valves, motors, pressure transducers, etc., in
the sampler-enricher. The connectors for disconnecting
the radiation cables are also mounted in these boxes.
The boxes are mounted on a supporting steel frame-
work above area 4A. Control-grade terminal blocks are
in the bottom box and safety-grade in the top. Again,
the safety-grade box is divided into three compart-
ments, with holes in the dividing partitions to permit
interconnection wiring between channels required for
power wiring and relay contact matrices. Also, a
protective cover marked *“220 V, 3-Phase™ was placed
over the three-phase motor terminals.

All exposed safety wiring between the junction box
and sampler-enricher apparatus is mechanically pro-
tected from physical 'damage. Also, as at the control
panels, wiring for ECI, control, and safety channels
Nos. 1, 2, and 3 is bundled separately from each other.
Radiation-resistant wires and shielded cables are used in
areas 1C, 2B, 3A, and 3B. Four-pin and eight-pin
weld-type receptacles are used to gain access to appa-
ratus inside the pressurized compartments.

3.12.2 Fuel Procéssing Plant Sampler - |

A schematic diagram of the fuel processing plant
sampler- is shown in Fig. 3.12.2A. The system consists
of a transfer tube connecting the fuel storage tank in
the fuel processing cell through one ball valve to a
leak-tight two-chambered shielded transfer box on the

-operating floor. The sample transfer tube passes
through the fuel processing plant containment barrier.
Sampling is accomplished by raising or lowering the
capsule while alternately opening and closing barriers
and purging the exposed volumes to the fuel processing
cell.

3.12.2.1 Comparison with fuel salt sampler-enricher.
The fuel processing plant sampler is the original fuel salt
sampler-enricher mockup, and the three control panels
are the original panels for the moAckup. The more
important differences in instrumentation between the
processing sampler and the sampler-enricher are that the
processing sampler does not have the maintenance
valve, and, because it does not penetrate the primary
reactor containment, safety-grade instrumentation is
not required. Also, because of the lower activity level in
the fuel processing system and the reduced containment
requirements, lower-quality components with higher
permissible leak rate are used for primary sensing
elements and block valves. Otherwise, the design for the
two is essentially the same, with the exceptrons noted
in the following paragraphs.

Helium line numbers in the sampler are ‘increased by
1000 over ‘the corresponding line numbers in the
sampler-enricher; for example, the buffer, line to the
removal valve is 670 for the sampler-enricher and 1670
for the processing sampler. All helium lines in the
sampler other than headers, are Y;-in.-OD copper tube
with solder-type fittings. The pneumatic operation of
the capsule access chamber door is the same. The leak
detector header is in one section. The equipment served
and the operation of the leak detector and buffer
headers are the same. There are no radiation solenoid
block valves in the buffer and purge lines. -

Off-gas from areas 1C and 3A is vented through or
around vacuum pump No. 1 to the fuel processing cell.
There is no backup off-gas block valve in line 1678
from area 1C. Operation of the off-gas solenoid valves is
shown in Figs. 3.12.2B, 3.12.2C, and 3.12.2D. The
removal area and the manipulator boot and cover are
exhausted through vacuum pump No. 2 to area 4A,

which is open to the fuel processing cell. The pneumatic

clamps on _ the capsule_ access chamber door, the
lngh-pressure relief in area 3A, the high-pressure relief

“in the 40-psig helium header, and the high-pressure

relief in the 80-psig access’ port header are vented
directly to the fuel processmg cell.

Radiation monitors are provided on transfer hne 994
only. These monitors provide signals for control inter-
locks and for the panel-mounted radratron meters and
high-activity annunciator alarm.

The removal valve is operated by a single phase motor

~ with its motor windings inserted directly in the control

39

circuit as shown in circuit A576, Fig. 3.12.2B. A cam
switch opens the motor circuit at 90° intervals of travel
of this ball valve, corresponding to the open and closed
positions. The operational valve has a pneumatic oper-
ator; air is supplied to the operator through solenoid
valves HCV-POV-Al and HCV-POV-A2 for opening and
closing the valve. The capsule access port, the capsule
cable drive, and the vacuum pumps are operated in the
same manner as the fuel sampler-enricher.

The ECI system is shown in Fig. 3.12.2E. The system
differs from the sampler-enricher in that wiring is not
required for the maintenance valve and the control-

- grade circuitry does not require the isolation resistor

and amplifier.

All the control and annunciator power is fed from the
120-V ac single-phase instrument power panel No. 2,
which, in turn; is fed from the reliable (solid state
inverter) power bus. Control power for operation of the

_barrier closures and the capsule cable drive is fed from

instrument power panel No. 2 through a permissive
switch on main board No. 11. The “on” condition of .
this switch is indicated by a green hght on main board
No. 11 and by a white “power on” light on processing
sampler panel No. 2. Smg!e-phase power for control and
operation of the vacuum pump motors is fed from
120-V ac instrument power panel No. 7. The radiation
instruments and ECI are fed from the regulated 120-V
ac single-phase instrument power panel No. A3.

" The same scheme was used for panel and intercon-
nection wiring as for the sampler-enricher, except that
the isolation and protection for safety wiring was not
required. The one relay cabinet was mounted on the
side of panel No. 1. In this case, the relays are mounted
in one cabinet, and the associated terminal blocks are
mounted in another cabinet, also on the side of panel
No. 1. The motor starters for the vacuum pumps are

‘mounted inside panel No. 3. Only one field wiring

junction box is provided at the sampler. Access to
apparatus inside the pressurized compartments is gained
by using four-pin and eight-pin weld-type receptacles
and mineral-insulated cables with weld adapters. The

‘mineral-insulated cables extend from the apparatus

inside the sampler to their terminating gland nut
assembhes at the field wrrmg ;unctron box '

- 3.123 Coolant Salt Sampler

A schematrc dragram of the coolantssalt sampler is

“shown in Flg 3.12.3A. The system consists of a transfer

tube connecting the coolant-salt’ pump through two
manually operated ball valves to a leak-tight non-
shielded dry box on top of the penthouse. The sample

 
 

 

 

transfer tube passes through the secondary containment
barrier in the MSRE. Sampling is accomplished by
raising or lowering the capsule while alternately opening
and closing barriers.

3.12.3.1 General instrumentation requirements. In-
strumentation consists of one small control panel,
direct-operating switches and gages, and control-grade
circuitry to supplement a system of mechanical inter-
locks. A helium buffer header is provided for the valve
seals and a vacuum pump for evacuating the dry box.
The key interlock system operates on the principle that
a key is used to unlock a device and also to gain access
to a key which can be used to unlock the next step in
the procedure. An electrical system sounds an alarm if

the pressures in the equipment are not suitable for the
next step to be undertaken.

Fig. 3.12.3B shows the alarm system, the capsule
cable drive motor, and the vacuum pump motor wiring.
As can be seen from circuit 350, the system is in the
safe or nonalarm condition when the box helium
pressure is less than 20 psig, when the buffer helium
pressure is greater than 15 psig, and when keys K3, K4,
and K6 are locked in. The alarm consists of a bell at the
sampler control panel and an annunciator in the main
control room. The first operation in the required
sequence is to obtain key K1 from its lock switch
mounted on main board No. 6 (see circuits 355 and
A356). The removal of K1 is indicated by an amber
light on main board No. 6. Its removal also causes a
bypass interlock (KA356A) to be made up around the
buffer helium pressure interlock (PS-C651-B) in the
alarm circuit; this permits the opening of buffered seals
without giving an alarm. Key K1 can now be inserted in
lock switch No. 2 to obtain key K4 or to unlock and
open valve V1 to obtain key K2 (see Fig. 3.12.3A).
When lock switch No. 2 is unlocked with key K1, key
K4 can be removed from lock switch No. 2 and used to
unlock the transfer line ball valves V4 and V5. There
will be an alarm when switch No. 2 is unlocked if the
box helium pressure is not between 4 psig and 6 psig.
Unlocking valve V4 with key K4 permits the valve to be
manually opened. After valve V4 is opened, key KS can
be operated. Operation of key K5 locks the valve in the
open position and releases the key. Similarly, keys K35
and K6 can be used to unlock valve V5 and to lock it in
the open position. When valves V4 and V5 are locked in
the open position, key K6 can be used to unlock No. 3
lock switch, thus permitting insertion and withdrawal
of the capsule by operation of the capsule cable drive.
The only other interlocks on the capsule cable drive are
the upper and lower limit switches (see circuit 352).
The reverse procedure must be followed to close the

transfer line ball valves and to recover key Ki. To
ensure that the capsule has been withdrawn before the
transfer line ball valves are closed, there will be an alarm
if the capsule is inserted 4 in. or more when key K6 is
removed from lock switch No. 3, preparatory to closing
valves V4 and V5.

Prior to or following the above sample insertion and
withdrawal operations, key K1 may be used to initiate a
sequence of operations associated with loading the
sample capsule into (or removing the capsule from) the
sampler vessel (glove box) and/or evacuation and
helium pressurization of the sampler vessel and glove
port. The evacuation and pressurization operations are
performed to purge oxygen from the glove box and to
equalize pressures in the vessel with the coolant pump
bowl pressure before opening transfer valves V4 and V5
or with atmospheric pressure before opening removal
valve V3. Precautions must also be taken during these
operations to prevent the occurrence of excessive
differential pressures between the glove box and the
glove port, since such differential pressures could result
in damage to the glove. To evacuate the glove box and
glove port, key K1 is used to unlock valve V1. When
valve V1 is opened manually and locked open with key

K2, key K2 can be removed and used to unlock valve

No. 2. After manually opening valve V2, the system can
be evacuated by opening hand valve HV-662-C. Pressure
is then adjusted by closing HV-662-C and bleeding
helium into the system through hand valve HV-C650-A.
The requirement that valve V1 be opened before valve
V2 ensures that pressures across the glove will be
equalized during evacuation. Following evacuation and
pressurization, valve V2 may be locked closed with key
K2, and key K2 may be used to unlock No. 1 lock
switch. (This operation could have been performed
prior to evacuation and pressurization; however, in
either case, valve V1 must be locked open before No. 1
lock switch can be unlocked. This condition ensures
that the pressure in the glove box can be equalized with
the atmosphere before the glove port is opened.) When
lock switch No. 1 is unlocked with key K2, the glove
port cover can be opened and key 3 can be removed
from lock switch No. 1. There will be an alarm when
lock switch No. 1 is unlocked if the pressure in the
glove box is not between 2 in. Hg vacuum .and 1 psig.
After key K3 is released from lock switch No. 1, it can
be used to unlock valve V3. Manually opening valve V3
permits transfer of the sample capsule from the sample
carrier to the glove box or vice versa. The reverse
procedure must be followed to release key K1 for use in
initiating sample insertion and withdrawal operations.

- The procedures described ‘above were abbreviated for
the sake of clarity in this discussion. Detailed pro-
cedures are given in- Sect 6B of the Operanons
Report.®

The coolant-salt sampler system differs from the
sampler-enricher system in that it does not penetrate
primary containment and-in that the activity of the salt
sample is very low. Since it does not penetrate primary
containment, dual barriers and safety-grade:instrumen-
tation are not required. Also, because of the low
activity level and reduced containment requirements,
lower-quality components with higher permissible leak
rates aré used, direct manual manipulation of the
sample is permitted, and instrumentation associated
with radiation monitoring and interlocking to prevent

the escape of activity are not required. These consider-

ations, together with the use of the -key interlock
system, resuited in a great reduction in instrumentation
from that required for the sampler-enricher and ¢hem-
ical process sampler' systems. In general, the system is
designed to 'meet the requuements for secondary
containment. The valving' arrangement and interlock
system ensure that at least one barrier (consisting of a
solid barrier or two closed valves) is intact during- all
phases- of sampler -operation. Commercial-grade instru-
ment coniponents are used throiighout. Threaded con-
nections and gasketed seals are permitted; however, in
some cases, weld-sealed construction and autoclave-type
connections were used for purposes: of reducmg hehum
outleakage and oxygen inleakage. "

In addition to the alarm and: interlock circuitry
described previously, electrical control  circuitry -is
provided for operation of the vacuum pump and for a
cable position indicator lamp. The vacuum pump motor
circuit is the conventional start-stop, ‘with a red light
indicating when the motor is running. A red light is also
provided to indicate when the capsule cable has been
withdrawn 18 in. from the pump bowl. .

3.13 FUEL PROCESSING SYSTEM
3.13.1 Introduction

* The MSRE fuel processing facility was constructed in

a small cell in the reactor building for two purposes: (1)
to remove any accumulated oxides in the fuel or flush
salt by hydrogen (H, )—hydrogen fluoride (HF) sparging
and (2) to recover uranium from the fuel salt by
ﬂuorme (F,) sparging. A complete description of both’
processes and the process equipment is described in
ORNL-TM-2578 This section describes the faclhtys
mstrumentatlon and control systems '

3 13 2 Process Descnptnon |

The followmg is a brief description of" the uranium
recovery process which. will serve to familiarize -the
reader with the processing system. A simplified flow
diagram of the system is shown in Fig. 3.13.1. A more
detailed diagram is shown in Figs. 3.13.2 and 3.13.3:5¢

The molten salt is forced by helium pressure from one
of three fuel drain tanks, FD1, FD2, or FFT, through
salt lines 107, 108, or 109, through the fuel salt filter
(FSF) in line 110 to the fuel storage tank (FST). The
FST and the salt lines leading to the fue! drain tanks are
shown in-Fig. 3.13.3. The FST and the salt.lines are
both reactor-grade components and are considered to
be a ‘part of the reactor fill and drain system when the
reactor is'in operation. Freeze valves FV-107, FV-108,
FV-109, FV-110, and FV-111 must ail: be frozen to
isolate the FST before processing operations begin.

The uranium recovery process consists essentially of

~ sparging the salt in the fuel storage tank (FST) with
* fluorine to volatilize the uranium, followed by decon-

tamination” of the evolved gas stream with a 750°F
sodium fluoride (NaF)bed (SFT) and absorption of the

~uranium hexafluoride in the gas stream on the 200°F

sodium fluoride beds (SFA). The excess fluorine in the
stream is then removed by an aqueous solution in the
 

 

 

 

~ caustic scrubber (CS). A highsurface-area mist filter

(CPF) located downstream of the scrubber removes any
particulate matter that the gas stream picks up from the
solution in the scrubber. A sodadime trap (SLT)
removes traces of fluorine from the off-gas before it
reaches the charcoal traps (CT1 and CT2). The charcoal

42

traps absorb any iodine that was not removed in the

caustic scrubber, and the gas leaving the charcoal traps

consists only of helium and oxygen that was produced
in the caustic scrubber. This gas mixture flows through
a flame arrester and then through an absolute filter
before being discharged into the containment air system
exhaust duct.

3.13.3 Design Considerations

Except for the fuel storage tank and the salt-carrying
lines connected to it, the components and systems in
the fuel processing facility did not have to meet the
stringent requirements governing the construction of
the reactor primary systems. The radiation exposure in

the cells is. much lower, the system will not be used

more than three or four times, and a secondary
containment barrier for lines and vessels containing
process fluids was not required. This allowed the use of
many conventional materials; for instance, all in-cell
conductors have standard polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
insulation, standard phenolic thermocouple connectors
were used in the cell, and some gaskets made of
inorganic materials are also used.

Nevertheless, the process gases used are highly corro-
sive, and the off-gases from the system can be highly
contaminated. Both of these conditions are very dan-
gerous to operating personnel; therefore, considerable
effort was expended to obtain a leak-tight system, and,
except for the gas supply stations, the entire process is
enclosed by the containment air system (see Sect.
3.11).

To obtain a leak-tight system, all joints are made with
Heliarc welds, by silver brazing, or with ring-joint
flanges, some of which have leak detector connections
(see specification No. MSRE-221).* Where possible, the
lines are connected to process vessels through check
valves to prevent contaminated gases from back flow-
ing. All control valves have bellows-type stem seals;
manifold valves in lines connecting instrument trans-
mitters to process lines are Hoke, Inc., type HGP which
also have bellows stem seals. {(See transmitter connec-
tion details on ORNL drawing E-NN-F-55463.)" Valves
with Teflon-packed stem seals are permitted in special
cases, but leak tests must be performed to demonstrate
that stem leakage is less than 1072 cc/sec. All joints in

helium and nitrogen supply lines between the control
panelboard and process vessels are silver brazed.
Screwed joints are permitted at instruments mounted in
the panelboard, but these were made up in the shop and
leak tested before the instrument was installed .in the
panel. Where a mechanical joint was required, Hoke,
Inc., solder-tube-type fittings were used. A typical
solder-tube fitting is shown in Fig. 3.13.4. Variations of
this joint design and the instructions for installing them
are shown on ORNL drawing D-NN-F-55461 .2

Two types of process signal transmitters are used in
the fuel processing system: the Taylor Instrument
Company model 206 (see specification MSRE-225)*
and the Foxboro Instrument Company model 15A (see
specification MSRE-227).* Both types operate on the
force-balance . principle to deliver 3- to 15-psig pneu-
matic output signals (see Chap. 5 of this report) and, in
addition to their performance characteristics, were
selected for this application on the basis of leak-
tightness and their ability to withstand the corrosive
effects of the process fluids, particularly hydrogen and
hydrogen fluoride gases. The sensing element in the
Taylor instrument is a silver-brazed beryllium-copper
double bellows. The silicone-fluid-filled diaphragm-
capsule sensing element and all process-wetted parts of
the Foxboro instrument are nickel-plated stainless steel.
Both elements will withstand process pressures in excess
of 100 psig without rupturing.

The instrument air lines are assembled by conven-
tional methods. Joints in tube runs are soldered, and
connections to instruments, supply headers, and at
bulkheads are made with compression-type tube fit-
tings. -

3.13.4 Electrical Control Circuits

There are only a few electrical control circuits in the
fuel processing system. Elementary diagrams of these
circuits are shown in Fig. 3.13.5° and ORNL drawing -
E-NN-E-55477.!° All of the circuits shown on these
two drawings are control grade. The only safety-grade
circuit in the fuel processing system is circuit 320, Fig.
4.1.34, which controls block valve ESV-609B in the
fuel-salt filter helium purge line 609.

Circuits Nos. A335, 335, 336, and 337 in Fig. 3.13.5
are valve control circuits. The operation of these
circuits is discussed in Sect. 3.13.5. Circuits 340, 341,
and 342 control lamps that indicate the position of
each valve. The switch contacts are operated by the
movement of the valve stem. When the valve is
completely closed, the green lamp is energized. If the

- valve opens just slightly, the switch contacts will
 

 

operate to deenergize the green lamp and energize the

red lamp. The lamps are located near the valve graphic
symbols on panelboard CPl and CP2. The FST vent
valve HCV-692A1 (circuit 342) operates two sets of
lamps, and the extra set is located on mam board MBll
in the main control room.

Annunciator circuits'® 1016 through 1028 control
the 12 annunciator units in two 6-point chassis,
XA-4051 and XA-4052. Each chassis is a Tigerman
Engineering Company model 440TL Tel-Alarm. The
two chassis are identical to those described in Sect. 4.12
and are part of the same system dlustrated by Fig.
4.12.6.

The instrument power distribution circuits are also
shown on drawing E-NN-E-55477.}° Power for all
instruments as well as for the position indicator lamps
shown in Fig. 3.13.5 is provided through circuit breaker
15 in instrument power panel IPP3. The annunciators
and valve control circuits, A335, 335, 336, and 337, are
powered from instrument panel IPP2 (see Sect. 4.13).
The annunciators are connected to breaker 15 and the
valve circuits to breaker 17. Both panels are supplied
from the reliable ac :nstrument power system shown in
Fig. 4. 13.1.

3 13.5.1 Helium supply system. Fuel processing is
ach1eved by sparging several industrial gases, under
pressure, through the salt in the FST. The gas is carried
to the tank by two lines, 690 and 608, as shown in Figs.
3.13.2 and 3.13.3. All sparge gases are carried by line
690, which is connected to a dip tube that extends to
the bottom of the tank. Gas is forced into the salt at
this point and rises through the salt and into the gas
space at the top of the tank. From there it is carried by
off-gas line 691 to the off-gas system, where it too is

processed. Helium gas for purging the space at the top

of the tank and for salt transfer operations is applied
through line 608. Line 694 is connected between sparge
line 690 and the FST gas space. Whenever valve
HCV-694A1* opens, the sparge dip tube is bypassed
and ‘the pressures in line 690 and the gas space equalize.

The helium supply system for sparging, purging, and |

salt transfer operations is shown in the upper right-hand

Instrument Application Tabulation and MSRE Instrument
Specification Sheets (refs. 3 and 4).

43

portion of Fig. 3.13.2. Helium at 40 psig pressure is
delivered from the main cover gas supply through line
530. Line 530 divides at the fuel processing panelboards

into three branches: lines 604, 609, and 619. When

transferring salt, helium pressure is applied to the FST
by opening valve HCV-530A1 and allowing helium to
flow into line 608 via line 619. The FST helium supply
and vent valves, HCV-530A1 and HCV-692Al, are
controlled by manually operated switches in the main
control room, and the operation of both valves is
subject to the restrictions imposed by control- and
safety-grade interlocks in circuits 115 and 120. Since
these circuits are described in Sects. 4.2.4.1 and 4.2.4.2,
they will not be discussed here. Line 609, which is the
purge supply for the fuelsalt filter (FSF), will be
discussed in a later paragraph when the FSF instrumen-
tation is described. Line 604 is a distribution header
which supplies helium to the lines used for purging and
sparging operations.

Pressure regulating valve PCV-604 A reduces the pres-
sure in line 604 to 19 psig, which is the maximum
needed for process operations. Relief valve PSV-604D
prevents the pressure in the distribution header from
exceeding 20 psig. Pressure-actuated switch PS-604C
opens to actuate annunciator PA-604C on control panel
CP1 if the pressure in the header falls below 18 psig.
Helium for purging the gas space in the top of the tank
is supplied from the header through line 608. The flow

- is measured by a Foxboro Instrument Company inte-

gral-orifice differential pressure transmitter, FE-608A-
FT-608 A (see Sect. 5.3.2.1). This is a standard Foxboro
type 15A transmitter with an integrally mounted
manifold containing an interchangeable orifice plate.
The assembly transmits a 3- to 15-psig pneumatic signal,
proportional to the square root of the rate of flow, to
panelboard CP1. The signal operates the receiver-type
pressure gage on CPl1 to indicate the actual flow rate.
Full scale flow rate is 20 standard liters per minute. The
same signal is also applied to two pressure-actuated
switches, FS-608 Al and -A2. The flow rate through line
608 is adjusted by operating a manual valve on
panelboard CP1. The higher flow rates are used during
processing operations, but a small purge flow is needed
at all times to prevent off-gases from backing up in the
line. If the flow ever falls below 4 standard liters per
minute,  switch contact FS-608A1 opens to actuate
annunciator FA-608A on panelboard CP1. If the flow
falls below 3.5 standard liters per minute, switch
contact FS-608A2 opens to deenergize control circuit
335, in Fig. '3.1.5., which automatically closes valves
HCV-690B1 in the fluorine supply line. This will stop
the flow of process gas into the tank, the tank pressure
 

 

 

 

will fall to zero, and the possibility of contaminated gas
backing up to the high-bay area will be reduced to a
minimum.

The two valves in circuit 335 are also energized
through two manual switch contacts, HS-690A and
HS-PS-A2. HS-690A is located on local panelboard CP2,
and HS-PS-A2 is a contact on the fuel process sampler
permissive-to-operate switch located in the main control
room. The sampler is connected to the gas space in the
FST by line 994 and cannot be operated when fuel is
being processed (see Sect. 3.12.2). If the permissive
switch in the main control room is not in the ‘“‘off”
position, contact HS-PS-A2 will be open and the two
valves cannot be opened to start processing operations.

Pressure transmitter PT-608B, manufactured by the
Taylor Instrument Company, measures the FST pres-
sure at all times and transmits a proportional 3- to
15-psig signal to operate several components. These are:

1. Two pneumatic pressure recorders, PR-608B1 and
PR-608B2. PR-608B1 is one pen on a two-pen
recorder located on MBI1. The other pen
(WR-FST-C1) records FST weight. PR-608B2 is
located on local panelboard CP1.

2. One pressure signal modifier, PM-608B1, which
converts the 3- to 15-psig input signal to a voltage
signal that can be utilized by the computer data
logger.

3. Five pressure-actuated switches, PSS-608B1 and -B2,
PS-608B1, PS-608B2, and PS-608B3. The first two

switches operate relays in the fill and drain circuits.

112 and 92 (see Sect. 4.2.4). PS-608B1 opens to
actuate annunciator PA-608B1 on panelboard CP1 if
the tank pressure exceeds 30 psig. Normally the
pressure never gets as high as 30 psig even during salt
transfer operations. PS-608B2 opens if the tank
pressure exceeds 5 psig, and PS-608B3 opens if the
pressure falls below 2 psig. If either switch opens,
annunciator PA-608B2 in the main control room is
actuated. Pressures in excess of 5 psig are not
encountered during normal processing operations.
Helium for the sparging process flows from the
19-psig header 604, through lines 607 and 690, to the
bottom of the FST. The flow through line 607 is
regulated and measured by a variable-area flowmeter
(FI-607A) mounted in panelboard CP1. A precision
metering-type needle valve for adjusting the flow rate is
built into the body of the meter. The measuring range
of the meter is 12 to 120 standard liters of helium per
minute. FI-607B, connected in parallel with FI-607A, is
a purge-type variable-area flowmeter with a measuring
range of 0.05 to 0.85 standard liters of air per hour. A

44

needle valve for adjusting flow rates is also built into
the body of this valve. A continuous flow of helium is
required in line 607 to prevent the backup of con-
taminated gases, and this purge flow is provided
through FI-607B.

During sparging operations the pressure in line 607
must always be greater than the pressure in line 608 to
prevent the cold sparge line 690 from filling with
molten salt that would be forced out of the tank if the
above condition is not maintained. Pressure differential
transmitter PAT-694A provides assurance that the cor-
rect differential pressure will always be maintained.
When the pressure in line 607 is less than 1 psi greater
than the pressure in line 608, the pneumatic signal from
the transmitter opens switch contact PdSS-694Al to
deenergize circuit 336. Valve HCV-694A1 opens and
the pressures are equalized. Circuit 336 is also energized
through the manual switch HS-694 A, which is located
on panelboard CP1. The normally opened push-button
S152 is also mounted on CP1 and is closed when the
process operation is started. The push-button contact
bypasses the normally open switch contact PdS-694 and
energizes HCV-694A2 until the pressure in line 690
builds up to its normal operating value. PAT-694A is
also manufactured by the Taylor Instrument Company.
It transmits a 3 to 15 psig signal proportional to
differential pressure. This signal is connected to two
other devices besides pressure switch PdSS-694A1. One
is a receiver-type pressure gage PdI-694A which in-
dicates the differential pressure measurement on panel-
board CPl, and the other is pressure-actuated switch
PdS-694A2. When the differential pressure measure-
ment is less than 2 psi, the switch contact opens and
actuates annunciator Pd A-694 A on panelboard CP1.

Line 610 provides a continuous helium purge to the
fuel loading line 111. The rate of flow is indicated on
panelboard CP1 by a variable-area-type purge meter
FI-610A. The meter has a measuring range of 0.05 to
0.85 standard cubic feet per hour and is identical to
FI1-607B, which was described previously. Helium lines
602, 603, and 2695 are opened infrequently to purge
the process lines after processing or when maintenance
is required.

3.13.5.2 Fluorine supply system. Before the process
operation begins, sparge gas line 690 is connected to
one of two gas supply stations depending on which
process operation is desired. For. the fluorination
process, line 690 is connected to the fluorine supply
line. For the hydrofluorination process, the connection
is to the hydrogen and hydrogen fluoride supply line.

The connection is made by reversing the position of a -

flanged elbow (see Fig. 3.13.6).
 

 

 

 

 

Fluorine gas for the sparging operation is supplied
from a tank (FT) mounted on a portable trailer as
shown in the lower left portion of Fig. 3.13.2. The
initial pressure in a full tank is 70 psig. Fluorine is
applied to the system when FSV-FT-Al, a remotely
operated shutoff valve on the trailer, is opened. Before
leaving the trailer the fluorine flows through flow safety
switch FSS-FT. Excessive flow rates actuate the switch,
and the shutoff valve closes automatically. This pre-
vents the escape of large quantities of fluorine to the
surrounding atmosphere, an unlikely event that could
result from a ruptured line or process vessel. The
70-psig pressure in the FT is reduced and automatically
controlled at a constant 18 psig by pressure control
valve PCV-690B1. After leaving the control valve, the
fluorine passes through a sodium fluoride trap, which
removes condensed hydrogen fluoride, and then enters
flow measuring element FE-690D. The pressure control
valve PCV-690B1 responds to signals from pressure
transmitter PT-690B that is connected to fluorine line
690 at a point just upstream of the flow element. Valve
FCV-690D responds automatically to signals generated
by FE-690D and controls the rate of flow of ﬂuonne
into the FST.

Flow safety shutoff valve FSV-FT-Al has a remotely
controlled pneumatic operator that is connected to the

45

instrument air supply through the three-way solenoid

valve FSV-FT-A2. The shutoff valve opens when the
solenoid is energized by circuit 337. To open the valve,
the operator momentarily closes push button S179A on
panelboard CP2, and relay K337 is immediately en-
ergized by the flow of current through the “close’ push
button S178A, push button S179A, and the relay coil.
When relay coil K337 energizes, contact K337B closes
to energize solenoid valve FSV-FT-A2, and seal-in
contact K337A closes to maintain the flow of current
when push button S179A is released. The contact

‘operated by flow safety switch FSS-FT-A is normally
“closed, but if the fluorine flow rate becomes excessive,

the switch contact opens, the entire circuit deenergizes,

- and the safety shutoff valve FSV-FT-Al closes auto-

matically. .Lamp [-337 lights up on panelboard CP2
when circuit 337 is energized. All of the components in
circuit 337 are mounted on the trailer as shown in Fig.

-3.13.12, except push buttons S178A and S179A and

lamp I-337. A duplicate “open” push-button sw1tch

- HS-FT-2 is also mounted on the trailer.

Valve PCV-690B1 has a Monel body with mtegral
ring-joint flanged connections, a bellows stem seal, and

‘a pneumatically powered operator. The valve is auto-

matically throttled to maintain a constant pressure of
18 psig on the upstream side of flow element FE-690D.

The pressure at this point is measured by a Taylor
Instrument Company transmitter, PT-690B. The trans-
mitter produces a 3- to 15-psig pneumatic signal
proportional to pressures in the range of 0 to 30 psig.
This signal is monitored on panelboard CP2 by a
Foxboro vertical scale indicator-controller PIC-690B.
The output signal from PIC-690B operates the control
valve PCV-690B to maintain the desired pressure in the
line downstream of the valve. The signal from the
pressure transmitter also operates a pressure-actuated
switch PS-690B which has two electrical contacts. The
contacts open simultaneously when the fluorine pres-
sure exceeds 25 psig. Contact PS-690B2 opens in circuit
335, Fig. 3.13.5, to deenergize solenoid valve
PCV-690B2. This vents the springloaded operator on
control valve PCV-690B1 and allows it to close. Contact
PS-690B1 opens to actuate annunciator PA-690B on
panelboard CP2.!°

The flow of fluorine into the FST is controlled at a
constant rate by throtteling valve FCV-690D. The
construction of this valve is identical to that of
PCV-690B1, which was described in the previous
paragraph. FE-690D-FT-690D is a Foxboro integral-
orifice differential pressure transmitter which measures
flows in the range of O to 50 standard liters per minute
and transmits a 3- to 15-psig pneumatic signal, pro-
portional to the square root of the flow rate, to the
Foxboro vertical scale indicator-controller FIC-690D
mounted on panelboard CP2. FCV-690D is positioned

‘automatically by the output signal from the controller

to maintain the desired flow rate.

A small amount of fluorine carried by line 2691 is
also introduced into line 691 at a point between the
FST and the sodium fluoride trap. This assures an
excess of fluorine in the gas stream after it passes

‘through the tank. The flow through line 2691 is

adjusted by a locally mounted hand valve and is
measured by another Foxboro integral-orifice. differ-
ential pressure transmitter FE-2691 A-FT-2691A. The
pneumatic signal from the transmitter operates pressure
indicator FE-2691A, a receiver-type gage mounted on
panelboard CP1. The full scale flow rate is 20 standard
liters per minute. '

3.13.5.3 Hydrogen and hydrogen fluoride supply
system. After the fluorination process is complete, the

_ reversible elbow in line 690 is connected to the

hydrogen- (H,) and hydrogen fluoride (HF) supply
systems, and the salt is sparged with hydrogen. This is a

- reduction process which removes certain corrosion

products that form when the salt is being fluorinated.
The same connection is also used during the oxide

 
 

 

46

removal process which requires a mixture of hydrogen -

and hydrogen fluoride gases.

Hydrogen fluoride is supplied from a single 100b
cylinder that must be heated in order to generate
sufficient operating pressure. Heat is applied by par-
tially submerging the cylinder in an open water bath
that is sparged with low-pressure steam. The tempera-
ture of the bath water is controlled automatically by
regulating the flow of steam with a self-contained
temperature control valve, TICV-HFC. The valve op-
erator is powered by a filled thermal system, and the
temperature sensing bulb is submerged in the water
bath. Temperature changes in the water bath cause the
valve to throttle so that the bath is maintained within
the desired temperature limits. The resulting pressure in
the hydrogen fluoride cylinder is measured by a locally
mounted Bourdon tube gage PS-696A with an integral
limit switch contact PS-696A. The contact is set to
open and actuate annunciator PA-696A on panelboard
CP2 if the pressure in the cylinder exceeds 22 psig. This
pressure corresponds to the maximum allowable cyl-
inder temperature of 125°F. Normal operating pres-
sures range from 15 to 20 psig.

The hydrogen supply consists of several standard
high-pressure cylinders connected to a common mani-
fold. The hydrogen supply line, 697, is connected to
the manifold through the two-stage pressure regulator
PCV-697B. The regulator is set to maintain a constant
pressure of 15 psig upstream of flow control valve
FCV-697D1 and contains an interstage relief valve that
prevents excessive internal pressure buildups. The reg-
ulator is also equipped with two gages which indicate
inlet and outlet pressures.

The flow from both the hydrogen and hydrogen
fluoride supply systems is automatically controlled at a
constant rate. The hydrogen control system is made up
of flow element FE-697D, flow transmitter FT-697D,
indicating controller FIC-697D, three-way solenoid
valve PCV-697D2, and flow control valve FCV-697DI.
The hydrogen fluoride flow control system con-
sists of components FE-696B, FT-696B, FIC-696B,
FCV-696B2, and FCV-696B1. Except for the orifice
diameters and the wvalve size factors (C,), the two
control loops are identical. The two orifices are
precision fabricated of Monel and are designed with
corner pressure taps, a special arrangement for accu-
rately measuring very low gas flows (Fig. 3.13.7).!3
The flow rate through each orifice is proportional to
the square root of the pressure drop, which is measured
in each case by a Taylor Instrument Company differ-
ential pressure transmitter. Each instrument produces a
3- to 15-psig pneumatic signal proportional to the

measured differential, and the signal is transmitted to
an indicator-controller on panelboard CP2. The in-
dicator-controllers are Foxboro vertical square root
scale-type instruments. The 3- to 15-psig signals pro-
duced by the controllers position valves FCV-696B and
FCV-697D1 to maintain the desired flow rates. Full
scale flow in the hydrogen fluoride system is 10
standard liters per minute when the temperature and
pressure downstream of the orifice are 180°F and 20
psig. Full scale flow in the hydrogen system is 55.5
standard liters per minute when downstream COI!dlthIlS
are 80°F and 13 psig.

The “on-off” action of both valves, FCV-696B and

FCV-697D1, is controlled by three-way solenoid valves -
FCV-696B2 and FCV-697D2. When the two solenoids

are energized by circuit A335, Fig. 3.13.5, the control
valve operators are connected to the outputs of the
automatic flow controllers. When the solenoids are
deenergized, the control valve operators are vented to
the atmosphere and they close. The three-way switch
arrangement in cirucit A335 is a safety precaution.
Switch S150 located on panelboard CP2 is used for
normal operations. S151 is located in the switchgear
room within sight of the hydrogen supply cylinder
station. If some part of the system should catch on fire,
an observer in the switchgear room can immediately
operate the switch to close both valves. Interlock
contact KA340A is operated indirectly by the position
switch on valve HCV-690A1 in fluorination line 690.
Neither the hydrogen nor the hydrogen fluoride flow
control valve can be opened unless HCV-690A is open,
in which case interlock contact KA340A will be closed.
An amber-colored lamp at each manual switch location
is lit when the circuit is energized.

The hydrogen fluoride gas is passed through an
electric heater located downstream of flow control
valve FCV-696B1. Its purpose is to raise the tempera-
ture of the gas above 180°F. At this temperature the
hydrogen fluoride is monomolecular (molecular weight
is 20) and can be metered more accurately. The heater
element is manually controlled, but a thermocouple,
connected to meter-relay TIS-HFH on panelboard CP2,
monitors the heater temperature. If the temperature
exceeds the high limit set on the meter, the meter-relay
contact opens to actuate annunciator TA-HFH on
panelboard CP2. Flow element FE-696C is a Hastings-
Raydist Corporation mass flowmeter which is described
later in Sect. 3.13.5.5.

3.13.5.4 Nitrogen and sulfur dioxide supply systems.
The fuel processing system first installed included a
fluorine reactor in line 693 between the sodium
fluoride absorbers and the caustic scrubber. The pur-
 

 

 

pose of the reactor was to remove excess fluorine from
the FST offgas. According to the original design of the
disposal system, the excess fluorine was expected to
react with sulfur dioxide to form sulfuryl fluoride,
S0, F;, a relatively inert gas that could be safely passed
through fiber-glass filters' and discharged to the at-
mosphere. The nitrogen and sulfur dioxide systems
supplied the necessary process gas to the fluorine
reactor, but it did not operate satisfactorily during tests
and was removed from the system. The nitrogen and
sulfur dioxide gas supply line 698 was subsequently
disconnected from the fuel process system and capped
off as shown in the upper left corner of Fig. 3.13.2.

The instrumentation in line 698 is relatively simple.
The high cylinder pressure is reduced to 30 psig by
pressure regulating valve PCV-698B. The flow is ad-
justed with a manual throttling valve and measured by a
variable-area flowmeter FI-698D. The valve and the
meter are both locally mounted at the gas supply
station. Two pressure switches, PS-698E2 and PS-
698E1, operate annunciator PA-698E on panelboard
CP1 in case of high or low pressures. -

3.13.5.5 Sodium fluoride absorbers. After leaving the
sodium fluoride trap, the gas stream passes through the
sodium fluoride absorbers, where uranium hexafluoride
is removed. The flow rate is monitored by three
Hastings-Raydist, Inc., mass flowmeters. Two of the
meters, FE-692B and 692C, are installed in the SFA
inlet line 692, and the third, FE-693A, is installed in
the SFA' outlet line 693. The output signal depends
only on the mass flow rate and the specific heat of the
particular gas and is, therefore, almost insensitive to
pressure and temperature changes.

The meters are used in this instance to provide a
sensitive indication of the uranium hexafluoride (which
has a high heéat capacity) concentration in the gas

stream. Two detectors with measuring ranges of 0 to 2 ,

and 0 to 10 scfm of air were required in the inlet line to
obtain both range and sensitivity. The meter in the
outlet line 693 has a range of O to 2 scfm of air. The
significance of the meter readings in terms of process
conditions is explained on-pp. 27 and 28 of ref. No. 1.
~ Five absorber units connected in series as shown in
Fig. 3.13.2 are placed in a sealed enclosure located in
the "high-bay operating area (see Fig. 3.13.5). The
enclosure is connected to the fuel processing cell and
the containment air system as described in Sect. 3.11.
Each absorber is mounted in an insulated can which has

- a heater and an air cooling coil in the bottom. The

heaters are used to heat each absorber unit to about
200°F before the start of uranium hexafluoride ab-
sorption. The absorption process is exothermic, and

when it begins, the heaters are turned off and the
cooling air is turned on. Temperature elements
TE-SFA-8 through TE-SFA-12 are thermocouples at-
tached to the bottoms of the cans. These are connected
to temperature recorder TR-3905, which indicates the
temperature of each heating element. The temperature
inside each absorber is measured by a single thermo-
couple inserted in a well that is built into each unit.
Temperature elements TE-SFA-1 through TE-SFA-5 are
connected to multipoint recorder TR-3903, where the
temperature inside each absorber is recorded.

Cooling air is supplied to each absorber can from a
common header which is connected to the 60-psig
service air system through solenoid valve HCV-970A.
The valve control circuit is interlocked with the SFA
enclosure exhaust blower, and the wvalve cannot be
opened unless the blower is running (see Fig. 3.13.5).
The blower must be running when the cooling air is
turned on in order to maintain a negative pressure in
the SFA containment enclosure.

‘The cooling air lines are purged at all times with a
small air flow. This is measured by the purge-type
variable-area meter FI-970B, which is connected in
parallel with the solenoid valve. The meter is mounted
in the pipeline. ‘

3.13.5.6 Caustic scrubber. The caustic scrubber is a
vessel 84 in. high and 42 in. in diameter, partially filled
with a caustic solution. The off-gas from the sodium
fluoride absorbers enters the caustic scrubber through
line 693 and dip tubes 695A and B. The gas stream is
bubbled through the solution, which removes excess
fluorine and hydrogen fluoride, and then leaves through
off-gas line 628 at the top of the tank. Instruments are
provided to measure the liquid level, the pressure, and.
the temperatures in the tank. Radiation measurements

and process sound measurements are also made.

The level measurement is made with a conventional
dip-tube bubbler system. The level signal is obtained by
measuring the diﬁ'erential between the pressure in the
dip tube. When the tubes are purged with a small gas
flow and the density of the liquid remains constant, the

differential pressure produced is proportional to the

height of the liquid above the bottom of the dip tube.
The normal height in the caustic scrubber is about 60
in. LT-CS-B, a Taylor Instrument Company differential
pressure instrument, transmits a 3- to 15-psig pneumatic
signal proportional to the level to a receivertype

pressure gage on panelboard CP2, FIC-CS-C1 and -C2,

also located on CP2, are variable-area-type purge flow-
meters used to regulate and monitor the nitrogen purge
flows in the dip tubes.

 
 

 

PT-CS-A is a Foxboro Company type 13A differential
pressure transmitter with one side of the measuring
-diaphragm connected to the caustic scrubber off-gas
line 628 and the other side vented to cell atmosphere
The instrument is calibrated to measure pressures in the
range of O to S psig and transmit a proportional 3- to
15-psig pneumatic signal to a receiver-type indicating
gage on panelboard CP2. The transmitted signal also
operates pressure switch PS-CS-Al to actvate annun-
ciator PA-CS-A, also on CP2, if the pressure in the
scrubber exceeds 2 psig.

Process sounds inside the caustic scrubber are de-
tected by ceramic contact microphone X ,E-CS-E
attached to the outside of the tank. The microphone
signals are transmitted to audio amplifier X, M-CS-E,
which drives speaker X4, M-CS-E2. The amplifier and
the speaker are located in a portable cabinet in the
operating area. The temperature inside the tank is
measured by a thermocouple in a well that is submerged
in the liquid contents. The thermocouple is connected
to multipoint recorder TR-3901.

3.13.5.7 Ofi-gas filters. The process off-gas leaves the
caustic scrubber through line 628 and passes through a
mist filter (CPF), a soda-lime trap (SLT) which removes

any remaining traces of fluorine, and two charcoal traps

(CT1 and CT2), where radioactive iodine is removed,
before it is discharged to containment air exhaust duct
940. The pressure in line 628 on the upstream side of
CT1 is measured by a Taylor Instrument Company
pressure transmitter, PT-CT1-C. A 3- to 15-psig pneu-
matic signal proportional to pressures in the range of O
to 3 in. H,0 is transmitted to a receiver-type dial
indicator (PI-CT-1C) mounted in panelboard CPl.
Excessive pressure buildup at this point in the line is an
indication that the charcoal traps are becoming plugged.
The connecting line between PT-CT1-C and line 628 is
purged continuously with nitrogen to prevent the
process gases from backing up into the transmitter. The
nitrogen purge supply is obtained from panelboard CP2
through the variable-area-type purge flow meter FIC-
CTi-C. _

Several thermocouples, some in wells and some
attached to the vessel walls, as shown in Flg 3.13. 2,
measure the temperatures of the off-gas filters. The
thermocouples shown are connected to multipoint
temperature recorder 3904.

Before the off-gas stream is discharged to the con-
tainment air stack, it must pass through an absolute
filter in line 940. The pressure drop across the filter is
measured by pressure-differential transmitter
PdT-940C, which produces a 3- to 15-psig pneumatic
output signal proportional to differentials in the range

of 0 to 5§ in. H,O. The signal is transmitted to a
receiver-gage-type indicator mounted in the bottom of
panelboard CP1. The absolute filter and the transmitter
are located in the spare cell.!*

3.13.5.8 Radiation monitors. Nine process radiation
monitors are used on the fuel processing system. Two
types of monitoring channels are used; one is a
Geiger-Muller tube which supplies an input signal to an

- ORNL model Q-1916 logarithmic response gamma

radiation monitor, the other is a standard commercial
Reuter-Stokes ion chamber which supplies a signal to an
E-H Research Laboratories model 202 electrometer.
Both monitoring systems are described in ORNL-
TM-729, Part I1A.2

Al but two of the monitors are jon chamber types

mounted on the off-gas components described in the .

previous section. RM-CS-D and RM-FST-I are installed
as a precautionary measure. RM-CS-D will detect and
indicate neutron multiplication in the unlikely event
that uranium hexafluoride accumulates in the caustic
scrubber, and RM-FST-E will indicate neutron multi-
plication in the FST. RM-CPF-A measures the activity
of fission products collected in the mist filter.
RM-CT1-A and B and RM-CT2-A and -B do the same
for charcoal traps CT1 and 2. Monitors RM-CT1-A and
-B operate switch contacts which open and actuate
annunciator unit 6 on panelboard CP2. Monitors
RM-CT1-A and RM-CT1-B are mounted at the top of
panelboards CPl1 and CP2. Monitors RM-FST-E,
RM-CS-D, RM-CPF-A, RM-CT2-A, and RM-CT2-B are
mounted in containment air panelboard CAP-2, which
is located on the opposite side of the high-bay area
from panels CP1 and CP2.
The two Geiger-Mueller-type momtors RE-CP3-A and
RE-940-G supply input signals to two of the three
model Q-1916 monitors mounted at the bottom of
panelboard CP2. RM-CP3-A (see Fig. 3.11.1) indicates
the amount of process radioactivity in the instrument
transmitter enclosure CP3. RM-940G indicates the
amount of activity in containment air exhaust duct 940
at a point downstream from the absolute filter. Limit
switches RS-CP3-A and RS-940G also actuate annun-
ciator unit 6 on panelboard CP2 (see circuit 1027).1°
3.13.5.9 Thermocouples. Eighty-two thermocouples,
in addition to those on the FST and the fuel-salt filter
FSF, are attached to the pipes and vessels in the fuel
processing system. Fifty of the couples are connected
to readout instruments through a patch panel mounted
on the rear of panelboard CP1. The remaining couples
are connected directly to four multipoint recorders
TR-3901, TR-3902, TR-3903, and TR-3904. The ther-
mocouples are listed by number in the tabulation in ref.
 

 

 

15. The tabulation also lists the patch panel connection
point, if any, and the readout device for each ther-
mocouple. The location of each couple-on pipelines and
vessels is shown in Fig. 3.13.6.12

All thermocouples have Chromel-Alumel conductors,
magnesium oxide insulation, and Y%-in.-diam Inconel
sheaths. These are attached by the two methods shown
in Fig. 3.13.8. Additional information is shown on
ORNL drawing D-NN-F-55466.1¢% By one method the
thermocouple junction is attached to a pad which is
welded to the pipe or vessel wall (see Sect. 6.7 of this
report). By the other method the thermocouple is held
in a well by a spring-loaded adapter fitting.

3.13.5.10 Fuel salt filter. A fuelsalt filter FSF is
located in line 110 between the FST and the fuel drain
tanks as shown in Fig. 3.13.3. The filter is designed to
remove corrosion-product solids from the fluorinated
salt before its reuse in the reactor.

The filter housing is a vertical section of 6-111 pipe 7
ft 9 in. long with a ring-joint blank flange cover on the
top end. The replaceable filter element, which is
- supported by a rod attached to the top flange, occupies

49

the lower half of the pipe section. Filtering action takes,

place when the transfer is from the FST. When the
transfer is from the fuel drain tank, the filter element
floats and offers very little resistance to the flow of salt.
For normal transfer operations the sait level is kept
below the baffles and a helium cover gas is maintained
in the space above the salt.

Temperatures are monitored by 11 rrnneral-msulated
Inconel-sheathed thermocouples attached to the outer
wall of the filter housing. Nine of these are connected
through the main patch panel to readout instruments in
the main control room. The other two, located near the
top flange, operate temperature interlocks TS-FSF-7A
and TS-FSF-9A which open to annunciate high temper-

atures in the filter gas space and to stop the transfer of

salt to the fuel drain tanks if the temperature of the top
flange on the filter gets too high. '

-The temperature interlocks. are contacts in two
Electra Systems Corporation temperature switch mod-
ules  (see Sect. 7.15) mounted in auxiliary board AB6.
The contacts are connected in control interlock circuits
101 and 102, Fig. 4.1.8. Thermocouple TE-FSF-7A is
located below the cover flange of the filter at a point on
the housing that is adjacent to the baffles. If the salt
level should rise to the baffles during a transfer, the
temperature at- this point will also rise and open switch

contact TS-FSF-7A in circuit 101. Relay K101 de-
energizes and opens contact K101A in circuit 115, Fig.

4.1.9, to close the FST helium supply valve,
HCV-530A1. This stops the flow of salt into the filter.

Two other contacts, K101D and K101E, on relay
K101 also operate in circuits 838 (see Fig. 4.1.52) and
427 (see Fig. 4.1.27). Contact K101D opens circuit 838
to actuate an annunciator unit on main board MB9.
Contact KI101E closes in circuit 427 to light the
high-temperature indicator lamp TA-FSF-7A located in
the filter graphic symbo! on main board MB10. Nor-
mally the pressure of the gas trapped in the top of the
filter housing will increase as the salt level rises. This in
turn will tend to drive the level back down by forcing
more salt through the filter and by reducing the transfer
flow rate. If during a transfer the level should continue
to rise, because of a leaky flange joint or perhaps faulty
check valves in helium line 609, the second temperature
switch TS-FSF9A will open and deenergize circuit 102
in Fig. 4.1.8. Circuit 102 is identical to 101. When relay
K102 deenergizes, contact K102A opens and de-
energizes circuit 112, and relay contacts K112A and
K112C open to deenergize circuits 115 and 120 (see
Fig. 4.1.9). This closes FST helium supply valve
HCV-530A1 and opens FST vent valve HCV-692Al.
This stops the transfer operation, and the salt in the
upper part of the filter drains to the FST. Two other
contacts, K102D and KI102E on relay K102, also
operate in circuits 838 and 427. Contact K102D opens
circuit 838 to actuate the same annunciator unit on
main board MB9. Contact K101E closes in circuit 427
to light the high-temperature indicator lamp TA-
FSF-9A, also located in the filter graphic symbol on
main board MB10. Circuits 101 and 102 cannot be
reenergized unless the temperature switches are closed
and reset push buttons S131A and S132A are closed
momentarily. These are control-grade interlocks de-
signed to keep the salt level below line 609 and the
ringjoint flange. A clean flange joint simplifies the
removal and replacement of the filter element. The
integrity of primary containment is assured by the
mechanical design of the filter housing.

“The helium purge supply line 609 assures the presence

- of a gas cushion in the top of the filter at a!l times and

purges salt line 110 of fuel processing gases that might
enter the fuel drain tanks. The supply system shown in
Fig. 3.13.2 is designed so that it does not compromise
the safety features built into the reactor fill and drain
system. These features prevent the accidental filling of
the reactor vessel which would result from inadvertent
and sudden pressurization of the fuel drain tanks (see
Sect. 4.2.4). This is accomplished by . limiting the
pressure and flow rate that can be applied through line
609. Pressure relief valve PSV-530C opens if the
pressure in the main helium supply line 520 exceeds 50
psig. If this pressure is unintentionally applied, the

 
 

 

purge flow rate is restricted to a maximum of §
standard liters per minute by the capillary-type flow
element FE-609C. This rate is only 30% of that
permitted by FE-517 in the fuel drain tank helium
supply line (see Sect. 3.2). Check valves downstream of
FE-609C prevent contaminated gas from backing up
into the supply line. The normal operating pressure in
line 609 is between 10 and 15 psig, depending on the
setting of pressure regulating valve PCV-609A. A special
weld-sealed solenoid block valve, ESV-609B (see Sect.
6.20), is installed downstream of PCV-609A. The valve
is energized to the open position by safety-grade circuit
320, Fig. 4.1.34. Contacts KB20C and KB21C will open
if an emergency drain or reactor fill restriction (see
Sect. 4.7.2) is called for, and the solenoid valve will
close the block line 609.

The fuel drain demand interlocks KB20A and KB21A
in the circuit controlling the FST helium supply valve
(see circuit 115, Fig. 4.1.9) can be bypassed on the
jumper board. This jumper may be used if necessary
during process operations, but its use is not pemutted
when salt transfers are made.

A Taylor Instrument Company transmitter PT-609D
measures the helium pressure in line 609 downstream of
the two check valves. A 3- to 15-psig pneumatic signal is
transmitted to a Foxboro vertical scale pressure in-
dicator in the main control room on MB10.

3.13.6 Equipment Layout

Most of the plant equipment, including instrumen-
tation, is concentrated in three main areas: the fuel
processing cells, the operating area, and the gas supply
station. An isometric view of all three areas is shown in
Fig. 3.13.6.12

3.13.6.1 Processing cells. Most of the processing
equipment is located in the fuel processing cell, which is
situated just north of the reactor drain tank cell. This
cell contains the fuel storage tank, the sodium fluoride
trap, the caustic scrubber, two remotely operated valves
(HCV-694A1 and HCV-692A1), three salt freeze valves,
and an exhaust blower that is connected to the
containment enclosure housing the sodium fluoride
absorber. The spare cell to the east of the processing
cell contains the remaining components in the off-gas
system. These include the mist filter, sodadime trap,
charcoal traps, and the off-gas filter — all of which are
located downstream of the caustic scrubber. Signal
transmitter PdT-940C, which measures the pressure
drop across the off-gas filter, is mounted on the north
wall of this cell. ORNL drawings D-NN-F-55467'* and
-55468'7 show plan views of the equipment and
instrument pipinig layout.

Figure 3.13.9 is a view of the processing cell looking-
from the east toward the west wall. The large vessel in
the upper center is the fuel storage tank (FST). The two
control valves and some of the instrument piping are
attached to the wall at the left. The caustic scrubber
(CS) can be seen in the lower right-hand corner. Trays
containing heater and other power wiring and the
conduits carrying the thermocouple lead wires are
clearly visible. The thermocouple lead wires and control
conductors leave the cell through a wall penetration in
the lower right-hand corner at a point ]ust beneath the
instrument panelboards.

3.13.6.2 Operating area. The operatmg area is lomted
on the west side of the fuel processing cell near the west
wall of the high-bay area. The instruments and controls
needed for data acquisition and routine operations are
mounted in two modular-type panelboards, CP1 and
CP2, located at the west edge of the processing cell.
Annunciators, process radiation monitors, and multi-
point temperature recorders occupy the upper one-third
of the two panels as shown in Fig. 3.13.10.1 Except -
for some additional process radiation monitors
mounted in the bottom right-hand comer, the instru-
ments and controls mounted in the lower two-thirds of
both panels are arranged in a full graphic display of the
process system. An electrical system relay junction box,
JB162, and the instrument air supply header are both
mounted on the right-hand end of the control panel-
boards. Figure 3.13.11 shows the panelboard and part
of the operating area in a view looking west toward the
high-bay wall. The signal transmitter containment en-
closure, CP3, is immediately behind the panelboard.
The enclosure is actually an extension of the con-
tainment wall that is fitted with airtight cover. All
signal transmitters connected to process lines and
equipment are mounted in the housing.?* The housing
is sealed except for a connection to the processing cell
which is exhausted by the containment air system. Any
leakage of process fluids from a transmitter will be
contained by this system and will eventually be
discharged from the containment air stack. The con-
tainment enclosure which houses the sodium fluoride
absorbers is shown to the right of the panelboards.

Other instrument equipment located in the oper-
ational area includes: (1) a portable cabinet containing
two additional multipoint temperature recorders and
one audio amplifier (see Fig. 3.13.10), (2) portable
hydrogen and oxygen monitors, (3) a constant air
monitor, and (4) the fuel processing sampler and
sampler instrument panelboards (see Sect. 3.12.2).

3.13.6.3 Gas supply station. The gas supply station is
located outside of the building near the southwest
 

 

 

 

 

f—

wall.!2 There is space enough in the drea between the
switchgear room and the blower house to park two
15,000-liter fluorine tanks (see Fig. 3.13.12) mounted
on trailers. The trailers are connected to a manifold on

the side of the building. High-pressure bottles con-

taining hydrogen, hydrogen fluoride, nitrogen, and
sulfur dioxide are connected to distribution manifolds
in cubicles located on the north wall of the blower
house. The manifolds are connected to the process
system by pipes mounted on the west wall of the
building. Instruments for measuring gas temperatures,
pressures, and flow rates are also mounted on the
building walls in this area. Since the temperature of the
hydrogen fluoride gas must be maintained above 180°F
to prevent condensation, two of the transmitters,
FT-696 and FT-697D, are mounted in steam-heated
enclosures. Additional details of the fluorine trailer and
the hydrogen fluoride cylinder are shown in ref. 7.
Helium gas for fuel processing is supplied from a
250-psig header in the reactor cover gas supply system
(see Fig. 3.5.0). The pressure is reduced to 40 psig by
pressure regulating valve PCV-530B in line 530, which
extends to two other regulators, PCV-530A and

PCV-604A (see Fig. 3.13.2), mounted on the west wall

of the high-bay area near panelboards CP1 and CP2.
3.13.6.4 Interconnections. There are no safety-grade

instruments or electrical interlocks in the fuel proc-

essing control system. All wiring and pneumatic tubing

is control grade and, for the most part, is installed in a -

conventional manner and in accordance with the

techniques described in Sect. 7 of this report. Standard

commercially available wiring and tubing devxces are
used throughout the system.
Panelboards CP1 and CP2 in the operatmg area are

the central interconnection points for all wires and

tubes in the system. Panel-mounted control elements
such as relays, push buttons, lamps, instruments, and
annunciators are wired to terminal strips CP1-A and

‘CP2-A located inside the panels.!? Field-mounted
elements, such as walve position switches, process- -

actuated switches, and solenoid valves, located in all
three of the main equipment areas are also wired

“directly to the same two strips.?® Jumper wires

interconnect the terminal points to form the desired

circuit arrangements.®'® These arrangements. wﬂl be -

explained later in this chapter.
_Lead wires connected to @ majority of the thermo-

couples in all three areas are brought together and
terminated on a 50-point thermocouple patch panel on’
the ‘rear frame of panelboard CP1.!® One end of a -

flexible lead is connected to each instrument in the two
panelboards, and the opposite end is connected to a

male plug that can be connected to any one of the 50
thermocouples on the patch panel. The remaining
thermocouple lead wires are also brought into panel-
board CP1, but these are connected directly to two
temperature recorders that are mounted in a portable
cabinet adjacent to CP2 (see Fig. 3.13.10).

All electrical conductors are run in rigid steel con-
duits. Thermocouple and other signal lead wires are run
in conduits separate from those carrying control and
power conductors. One group of conduits, which can be
seen in Fig. 3.13.11, leaves the top of the panelboards
and runs along the west wall of the high-bay area. These
carry conductors connected to devices in the SFA
housing and to other devices mounted on the wall.??
Another group of conduits?! serves equipment at the
gas supply station on the outside of the building. This
group leaves panelboards CP1 and CP2 at the bottom
through sleeves in the concrete floor at the 852-ft level
(high-bay area), emerges on the west wall of the diesel
house (DH) at the 840-ft level, and continues along the
west side of the building to the gas supply stations.

A third group of conduits®? also extend from the
bottom of the panelboard to two large pull boxes
mounted on the outside west wall of the fuel processing
cell at the 840-ft level. Three conduits then penetrate
the concrete cell wall to connect the two boxes to the
inside of the cell. The conduit carrying the thermo-
couple lead wires terminates at another pull box on the
opposite ‘side of the wall. From this point several
smaller conduits branch out to distribute the lead wires
to the appropriate thermocouples. The other two
conduits, carrying control and power conductors from
the second box, are connected to conduits that extend
along the north wall of the cell. One of these splits into
several branches and carries conductors to control
elements located in different parts of the cell. The other
conduit extends through the east wall of the fuel
processing cell and through the spare cell and then joins
with the wire trays in the north electric service area. It
carries control conductors to the main and auxiliary
control rooms via: the transmitter room. The fitting in
each of the conduit sleeves which penetrate the cell wall
is a sealing conduit. After all the conductors were
installed, this fitting was filled with a liquid epoxy
compound that hardens and seals the opening between
the processing cell and the pull box.

The pneumatic tubing lines are mounted on the same
racks and follow the same routing as the electrical
conduits. One group of tubes?® connects the panel-
board in the high-bay area with the instruments in the
transmitter housing (CP3). Another group’ connects
the panelboard to instruments located at the gas supply

 
 

 

 

station. A third group'*''”7 connects the panelboard
with components in the two processing cells.

'3.14 MSRE INSTRUMENT AIR
SUPPLY SYSTEMS

3.14.1 General

The MSRE instrument air supply system is designed
to achieve maximum safety, reliability, and serviceabil-
ity. Reliability of the system is enhanced through
redundancy. Two complete compressor and dryer sys-
tems are installed in parallel. Either compressor may be
selected as the operating compressor. The other com-
pressor then becomes the standby compressor and
comes on line automatically if the main header pressure
falls below a preset limit. - _

The output of the compressor is supplied to a main
header (line 9000), which, in turn, supplies five normal
air subheaders (9001-9005) directly, and to six “emer-
gency” subheaders (9007—9011 and 9013) through a
check valve. Each subheader except the block valve
header (9013) is equipped with a filter and pressure
reducing station. Additional subheaders carry the air
from the main reducing stations to various operating
and control areas where it is further reduced in pressure

if and as required. Noncritical instruments are supplied

by the normal air header, and critical instruments are
supplied by the emergency air headers. Critical instru-
ments are those which must continue to operate if
pressure is lost in the main instrument air header. In
general, these are the instruments required for a safe
and orderly shutdown of the reactor; however, some
additional data instrumentation is included in this
category for record purposes.

The emergency “air” is obtained from a system of
nitrogen cylinders, which are capable of supplying the
load on the emergency headers for a period of 30 min.
Instrument air may also be obtained from the service air
compressor by opening valves V-9130 and V-9132 in a
line interconnecting the service and instrument air
systems. These valves are normally closed and the
systems operated independently. Service air is used for
applications such as supplying air to freeze valves in the
 

 

coolant and fuel transfer lines and operating pneumatic
toolsjand is, therefore, less reliable than instrument air.

A “normal” nitrogen supply system supplies nitrogen
requirements for operation of temperature scanner
switches and reactor cell sump bubblers, as well as for
operation of the chemical plant caustic scrubber and
reactor cell pressurization. -

All instrument air supply system power supply
sources are automatically switched to the emergency
diesel-generated source on loss of the primary power
source.

A complete single-line diagram of the system is shown
in Figs. 3 14.1 and 3.14.2.

' 3.14.2 Components

3.14.2.1 Suction air filter. Each compressor is sup-
plied with a suction air filter of the replaceable
cartridge type.

3.14.2.2 Compressors and dryers. Compressors are of
the reciprocating type with drive motors operating from
440-V, three-phase, 60-cycle power. Motors are sized so
“that no portion of the service factor is used. Each
‘compressor is capable of supplying 100 scfm of com-
pletely oil-free air at 80 psig. The compressors are
vertical, water-cooled-type machines with Teflon rings.
Protection against damage resulting from low oil pres-
sure and high outlet air and cooling water temperatures
is provided by switches PS-AC1A and 1B, TS-ACI1B and
2B, and TS-ACI1A and 2A, respectively. Throttling
-valves TV-880C and D control cooling water outlet
temperature by throttling inlet water in response to the
outlet cooling water temperature measured by bulb-
type sensors installed in thermowells TW-880C and D.
Solenoid valves ECV-880A and B shut off cooling water
flow when the compressor is shut down. Dial indicators
TIAC-1F, 2F, 1G, and 2F provide local indication of
cooling water outlet temperature. Pressure switches
PS-ACID and 2D operate solenoid valves PCV-ACIE
-and 2E, which, in turn, operate unloading valves on the
compressor. Pressure gages ACIK ‘and 2K provide a
means of reading pressure in the lmes supplymg the
unloading valves.

. The operating compressor can run at no load or full
" load and is automatically unloaded when the pressure
reaches 85 psig. It is reloaded again when the pressure
drops to 75 psig.

If for any reason the pressure falls to 70 psig, the

53

operating compressor until it is manually shut down.
Coincident with the startup of the spare compressor, an
audible and visual alarm is actuated in the main control
room.

" The system controls are arranged so that either

compressor may be considered the operating comp-
ressor or the spare compressor. Any shutdown of either
compressor by any means other than manual results in
an audible and visual alarm in the main control room.

For further discussion of compressor controls see
Sect. 4.9.2.

3.14.2.3 After cooler. Each compressor is provided
with an aftercooler. Each aftercooler has an automatic
drain trap which is equipped with a self-cleaning filter.
No instrumentation is installed on the aftercooler.

3.14.2.4 Separator. Each compressor is equipped with
a separator at its outlet to remove all particulate matter
and free water before inlet to the dryers. The separators
are mounted and piped on a common base plate with
the dryers and are equipped with automatic traps. Dial
indicators TI-AC1H and 2H provide local indication of
air temperature at the separator outlet.

3.14.2.5 Receivers. The system receivers are sized to
provide air at the maximum consumption rate for 5 min
in the event of air system failure. During this period the
pressure would drop from 80 psig to 40 psig. The
receivers are equipped with safety valves and drains
with automatic traps. Receivers were designed, fabri-
cated, inspected, and stamped in accordance with the
ASME code for unfired pressure vessels, latest revision.
Local indication of receiver tank pressures is provided
by pressure gages PI-R1-and R2. Dial indicators
TI-AC1J and 2J provide local indication of receiver
tank temperature.

3.14.2.6 Dryers The dryers are capable of delivering
100 scfm of dry air with a dew point less than -55°C,
with 100% water-saturated inlet air at 100°F. Recycling

‘of each drying and filtering system is fully automatic.

‘spare compressor is automatically loaded and remains -

loaded until the system pressure is 85 psig. The spare
compressor will continue to operate in parallel with the

The filter and drying systems are designed so that each
one is in service for not less than 3 min before
reactivation is necessary. The dryers are"of a heatless
type

The dryers are des:gned so that the maximum
pressure drop is 5 psi. Each dryer is equipped with a
flow indicator to show the rate of purge air usage and a
pressure gage to indicate tower pressure.

A mechanical filter is installed downstream from the
dryer to remove any absorbent carry-over that may
occur. The inlet to the dryers is also filtered.

3.14.2.7 Main header. Provisions were made for
monitoring the flow and moisture content of air from

the dryers to the main headers. Rotameter FI-9000A -
 

 

 

monitors the flow. Moisture content is detected by
X E-9000B and indicated locally on X I-9000B. Main
header pressure is indicated locally by pressure gage
PI-9000 and monitored by pressure switches PS-9000-1
and 2. When main header pressure is low, PS-9000-!
operates a common annunciator in the main control
room via Rochester alarm module PA-9000 and initiates
startup of the standby compressor.

3.14.2.8 Emergency nitrogen system. The emergency
nitrogen system is automatically actuated if the system
pressure drops to 65 psig and holds the pressure at 65
psig by pressure regulation. Actuation of the emergency
nitrogen system is accomplished by an audible and
visual alarm.

The nitrogen is supplied by two banks of nitrogen
cylinders. Either bank may be valved off for service or
repair. Pressure gages PI-9006-1 and 2 provide local
indication of the pressure of each bank. Pressure
switches PS-9006-1 and 2 actuate annunciators
PA-9006-1 and 2 in the main control room and provide
early and final warning of low nitrogen supply pressure.

The nitrogen supply pressure is reduced to 65 psig by
a conventional pneumatically actuated throttling valve
(PCV-9006-1), which is controlled by pressure control-
ler PIC-9006-1. This instrument has proportional action
and a Bourdon-type sensing element. Supply for the
controller is obtained from the nitrogen cylinders
through a pressure reducing system consisting of pres-
_ sure regulators PCV-9006-2 and 3 and relief valves
PV-9006-1 and 2. Pressure gage PI-9006-3 provides a
local indication required for adjustment of PCV-9006-2.
Pressure gage PI-9006-4 provides a local indication of
the controlled nitrogen pressure. Rotameter FI-9006
provides a local indication of flow from the nitrogen
system to the instrument air headers. Since the control-
ler is set for 65 psig, the controller holds vaive
PCV-9006-1 closed as long as the compressors maintain
the pressure above this valve, and there should be no
- flow through FI-9006. (Nitrogen flow under these
~ conditions indicates a leaky valve.) If the header
pressure drops below 65 psig, the controller opens valve
PCV-9006-1 and admits nitrogen to the emergency air
headers as required to maintain the pressure. Flow of
nitrogen to the normal air headers is prevented by a
check valve.

3.14.2.9 Main piping. The main air system piping
materials are as follows: sizes 2 in. and larger seamless
steel, sched 40, ASTM-A106, grade A or AS3 seamless.
-All main piping is of all-welded construction. Valves are
150-Ib globe type, with steel bodies, nickel alloy

54

connections. In some cases the use of 304 stainless
steel, sched S seamless, or 347 stainless, seam-welded
sched S, pipe was authorized.

- 3.14.2.10 Reducing stations. Each pressure reducing
station consists of a parallel arrangement of two filters,
Fulflow model BR-7A, and two regulators, Moore
Products Company model 40-30, 42-50, or 40-200.

. Detailed information on the regulators mentioned

screwed-in seat, bolted bonnet, and rising handwheel.

Valves are connected into the system by weld-end

above can be found in MSRE instrument specifications
MSRE-157, 158, and 159. Block valves are provided so
that either parallel filter-regulator combination can be
isolated from the system to facilitate maintenance.
Each reducing station is provided with a pressure gage

to indicate both the supply pressure and the reduced

output pressure. These gages are specified in MSRE
instrument specification MSRE-160 or MSRE-161, de-
pending on the pressure range required. A relief valve is
located in the reduced pressure line at each reducing
station to protect the instrumentation served from
excessively high pressure. The relief valves are Circle
Seal Products Company type 559B-4M valves as speci-
fied in MSRE instrument specification MSRE-162. A
low-pressure switch, instrument specification MSRE-

154, is provided to give an audible and visual alarm
annunciation to the operators if the reduced pressure
drops too low.

Schematic representations of the pressure reducing
station appear in Fig. 3.14.1.

3.14.2.11 Low pressure lines, All air system low-pres-
sure lines smaller than 1 1/2 in. are fabricated of ASTM
B75-52 copper. All connections in these lines are made
with compression-type fittings. Construction details and
the layout of control panel air headers are shown in
Figs. 3.14.3 and 3.14.4.

'3.14.2.12 Construction. Insofar as possible, the entire
instrument air system piping is of all-welded construc-
tion. To allow for future additions of field-mounted
instruments, a %-in. valved connection was provided
every 20 ft on the instrument air main.

The maximum use of pipe bends was employed in
order to minimize the number of fittings and welds
required. Also, the longest standard lengths of pipe
were used in a further effort to reduce the number of
fittings.

3.14.3 Cleaning

All components and materials of the air system were
thoroughly cleaned before use. Cleaning methods and
storage precautions were in full accord with the
standard established procedures for MSRE materials.

3.14.4 Test and Inspection of the System

Test and inspection of the system during construction
was made the responsibility of one individual. During
installation every effort was made to exclude all foreign

‘55

material for the pipe or equipment. Before final

inspection and tests, all air mains and branches were
checked with a flow test to ensure that no obstructions
were present in the system. Any restricted lines were
cleared prior to additional testing.

After ‘installation, all piping was pressure tested to
125 psi with clean, dry air. The soap bubble test was
used to check all connections for leaks. After all
detected leaks were repaired, the system was again
pressurized to 125 psi and held at this pressure for 30
min. All leaks detected during this period were repaired.

" 3.15 OFF-GAS SAMPLER

An instrument applications drawing for the off-gas
sampler is shown in Fig. 3.15.0. Figure 3.15.1 is a
simplified schematic of the sampler system. This sam-
pler provides a means for on-line determination of the
presence and level of hydrocarbons and other impurities
in the reactor off-gas stream and for collecting a
concentrated sample of gases, other than hydrocarbons,
in a sample bomb which can be removed to a hot cell
for further analysis. The reactor off-gas is sampled by

the various lines. During sampling operations one of
two paths is generally used. The first is through a
copper oxide scrubber, a conductivity cell with an
associated absorber (AcE-1), a second conductivity cell
(AtcE-2), and then through a flowmeter (FE-2B) to the
return line. The second path is the same as the first
except that the gas discharging from the first con-

‘ductivity cell is diverted through a liquid-nitrogen-

cooled molecular sieve instead of passing through the
second conductivity cell. Other paths are possible and
are used for various purposes.

Tn both modes of operation, hydrocarbons in the gas
stream are oxidized to carbon dioxide and water in the
copper oxide scrubber. The carbon dioxide and water
are removed from the stream by a charcoal absorber.
The difference in the therma! conductivities of the
stream, before and after the charcoal absorber, is
related to the hydrocarbon content of the off-gas
sample stream -and is measured by the conductivity cell.
The output of this cell, which is displayed on panel-
mounted recorder AycR-1, may be calibrated in terms
of percent hydrocarbon content. Part of the calibration
procedure requires that the same gas flow through both

~ the reference and measuring legs of the cell. This is

accomplished by bypassing the gas around the charcoal
absorber through valve VIE. The basic principles of
operation of the conductivity cell are explained in Sect.

3.154.3.

taking a side stream of 100 cc/min from the reactor

off-gas stream at a point upstream of the main charcoal
beds and either upstream or downstream of the particle
filter. Except for a delay time of approximately 40 min,
samples taken above the particle trap are’identical to
the pump bowl exit gas. By sampling upstream and
downstream of the filter and using the hydrocarbon
detector in the sampler, the relative effectiveness of the
particle filter may be evaluated. The simplified diagram
shown in Fig..3.15.1 assumes the sample is taken below
the particle filter. In this mode of -operation, the gas
~stream flows to the sampler through line 537 and
returns through sampler line 538. When the sample
point is taken above the particle filter, the gas stream
flows to the sampler through reactor off-gas lines 533
and 561 and sampler line 538 and returns through
‘sampler line 537 (see Fig. 3.6.0). In this mode of
operation, the entrance .and exit points on the sampler
are reversed. This can be corrected by using sampler
lines 4 and 5 and valves V1A, V2E, V2C, and V2F to
reverse the -connections -of the sampler internals to
sample lines 537 and 538. Within the sampler the gas

In the first mode of operatlon the gas leaving the first
conductivity cell passes through the second cell
(ApcE-2), where its thermal conductivity is compared
to that of a reference gas (helium) which flows from a

gas cylinder through the cell reference leg. The output

of this cell, which can be made proportional to the
gross contaminants .in the gas stream minus the hydro-
carbons, is displayed on a panel-mounted recorder
(ArcR-2). ‘This cell is calibrated by first purging
contaminated gases from the system and then alter-
nately flowing two standard.gases through the mea-
suring leg of the cell. One of these gases is used in

setting the cell zero, and the other is used in setting the

~span. The standard gases, supplied from two separate

gas cylinders, are special mixes prepared for the

application. The instrumentation of the gas supply
system will be discussed in Sect. 3.15.3."
In the second mode of operation, the gas leaving the

first conductivity cell is diverted through a liquid-

may flow through several paths. The path followed is

determined by the position of hand-operated valves in

nitrogen-cooled molecular sieve rather than passing

‘through the second conductivity cell. In this mode,
most of the gases contaminating the helium carrier gas

are liquefied and collected in -the chilled molecular
sieve. The helium carrier gas is not liquefied and passes
 

 

 

 

through the sieve. The reason for passing the gas stream

through the scrubber, first conductivity cell, and

charcoal absorber before entering the sieve is to remove

hydrocarbon contaminants which might foul the sieve.
The sample trapped in the sieve may later be

transferred to a sample bottle by:

1. isolating the sieve,

2. pumping a vacuum above the sieve,

3. connecting the sieve to the sample transfer bottle
while continuing the vacuum pumping,

4. isolating the sieve and transfer bottle from the
vacuum pump,

5. boiling off the liquid nitrogen,
6. heating the sieve,

7. isolating the transfer bottle.

3.15.1 System Layout

The primary components of the off-gas sampler are

located inside a containment housing installed below

floor level in a pipe trench south of the vent house. The
arrangement of components in the containment enclo-
sure is shown in Fig. 3.15.2. All valving in the system is
physically located at the top of the containment
enclosure with the valve handles extending through seal
glands into the enclosure. All other equipment in the
enclosure is arranged for vertical access after the valving
complex is removed. A removable grating allows access

" to the valves. Sampler operations are controlled by

manipulation of these valves and by instrumentation
located on a panelboard in the south end of the vent
house. Figure 3.15.3 shows the layout of this panel-
board. Since all major sampling operations are carried
out at the sampler, all readout of information is
presented at the sampler panels; however, occurrence of
an alarm condition at the sampler will actuate an
annunciator in the main control room, and some
information is transmitted to the computer data logger.
Also, a sample permissive switch is located in the main
control room. This switch, which is connected in the
block valve circuits, prevents operation of the sampler
without knowledge of the reactor operators.

3.15.2 Containment

Since fission gases flow directly from the reactor to
and through the off-gas sampler, most of the primary
components and lines in the sampler are an integral part
of primary containment and, for this reason, are located
in a containment enclosure at the south end of the vent

56

house. Also, since some components of the sampler do
not meet the requirements for primary containment
system components, solenoid block valves are installed
in the inlet and outlet lines which connect the sampler
to the reactor system. Two valves are installed in series
in each line. These valves (ESV-537A and B and
ESV-538A and B) automatically close and isolate the
sampler from the reactor system in the event of high
pressure in the reactor containment cell, high pressure

in the fuel pump bowl, or high air activity in the

sampler enclosure. High reactor cell pressure is in-
dicative of a rupture of the primary containment and
the occurrence of the maximum credible accident. High
fuel pump bowl pressure indicates that conditions exist
that could result in a rupture of the sampler primary
containment. High sampler air activity indicates that a
rupture of the sampler primary containment has oc-
curred. Closure of the block valves resulting from high
sampler air activity (and the accompanying alarm) also
provide protection to the sampler operator against the
occurrence of high background radiation resulting from
small leaks in the sampler. Sampler air activity is
detected by two G-M-tube-type radiation detectors
(RE-54A and B), which monitor two separate and
independent air samples collected from and returned to
the sampler enclosure. The isolation block valves and
associated detecting instruments and control circuitry
were designed in accordance with the criteria and
standards used in the design of the reactor safety
protective circuits (see Sects. 1.2.3, Part IA, and 4.8.2).
The solenoid block valves are weld-sealed types de-
scribed in Sect. 6.20. Signals from the radiation
detectors are input to two ORNL model Q-1916
radiation monitors (see Sect. 2.10, Part IA) located on
the sampler panel. In addition to providing interlock
contacts for the containment safety circuit, these-
monitors provide contacts RS-54-A1 and B1, which
operate a common annunicator (RA-54A) at the sam-
pler panel, an indication of radiation level at the
sampler panel, and a millivolt level signal proportional
to radiation which is input to the data logger. A pair of
small fans in a separate enclosure circulates air from the
enclosure to the disconnect boxes, past the detectors,
and then back to the enclosure, thus providing more
rapid detection of system leaks. The fans also maintain
a slight vacuum in the system, which, under normal
conditions, ensures that enclosure leakage will be
inward. The sampler and detector enclosure are vented
to the stack. The detectors are shielded from the
sampler so that they detect activity in the recirculating
air only. Vane-type flow switches FS54C and D
monitor the recirculating air flow and operate an
annunciator (FA-54C) when flow is low.
 

 

 

- All instrumentation components which form a part of
the primary containment system meet or exceed the
primary containment requirements for 50 psig oper-
ating pressure and 75 psig burst pressiire.

All electrical penetrations to the sampler are made
either by means of MI cable with hermetically sealed
connectors for high level signals, or by means of
epoxy-sealed bell housings with six pairs of thermo-
couples inside a '-in. copper tube similar to the seal
used at the reactor cell junction boxes (see Flgs 6.7.20
and 6.7.21).

3.15.3 Sampler lnstrumentatién_ |

Instrumentation is provided for on-line thermal con-
ductivity analysis; for measurements of flows, pressures,
and temperatures required for proper operation of and
interpretation of data from the conductivity analyzers;
for control of temperature of a molecular sieve trap and
of the level of a liquid-nitrogen bath in which the
molecular sieve is immersed; for detection and annunci-
ation of undesirable operating conditions; and to
prevent the occurrence of hazardous conditions.

3.15.3.1 Thermal conductivity. The conductivity sen-
sors (ArcE-1 and -2) are Gow-Mac model TR-111A
temperature-regulated thermal conductivity cells. The
conductivity cell is basically a temperature-regulated
metallic block with four separate cavities in' which
exposed electrically heated filaments are installed. Two
of these cavities connect with the passage through
which the reference gas passes, and two connect with
the sample gas passage. The filaments' are arranged
“electrically in a Wheatstone bridge with the filaments
exposed to the reference gas in one pair of opposite legs
of the bridge and the two exposed to the sample gas in
the remaining opposite legs. A preset regulated current
is passed through the bridge to heat the filaments. The

57

thermal conductivity of the gas surrounding the fila-

ments determines the rate of cooling and therefore the

Excitation current for each cell is supplied from a
separate power supply. The power supplies are located
on the sampler panel and have provisions for adjusting
the excitation current, zero, and sensitivity (span) of
the cells. By means of these adjustments the recorder
can be calibrated to read directly in terms of percent
impurity in the sample gas. Since the zero adjustment
provided in the power supply affected the filament
temperatures and proved to be difficult to adjust, a
second (fine) zero adjustment was provided in the
recorder. _ _

The temperature of the cell block is controlled by
means of a Thermoswitch and heater on the block (see
Sect. 3.154).

Three cylinders supply gas to the conductmty cells.
One cylinder, containing pure helium, is used for
reference gas for the second conductivity cell
(A1cE-2). This gas is also used to purge out the system.
Two pressure requlators reduce the cylinder pressure to-
10 to 30 psig. The first (PV-61A) reduces the pressure
below 125 psig. The inlet and outlet pressures of this
regulator are indicated locally on gages PI-61A1 and
A2. A second regulator (PV-63A) reduces the pressure
to the desired operating point. This regulator is
mounted on the sampler panel for the convenience of
the operator Pressure gages PI-61C and P1-63C indicate
the pressure upstream and downstream of PV-63A and
are mounted on the sampler panel beside the regulator.
Pressure switches PS-61B1 and B2 and PS-63B1 and B2
monitor these. pressures and initiate an alarm at the
sampler panel and in the main control room if they are
too high or too low. The flow of reference gas to
conductivity cell ArcE-2 is controlled by 'a_ panel-
mounted micrometer-type adjustable valve and in-
dicated on the panel by rotameter FI-70A. Backflow
from the sampler to the gas system is prevented by a
check valve. Since the reference gas discharge from the
conductivity cell is vented to the stack, ‘only one check

- valve was required in this line.

temperature of the filaments. When a sample gas having

a thermal conductivity different from that of the
reference -gas s passed ~through the cell, the two
filaments in the sample cavity are cooled if the

conductivity of the sample gas is higher than that of the

reference gas and warmed if it is lower. In either case

the resistance of the filaments, which is a function of

temperature, changes, the bridge becomes unbalanced,
and-a millivolt level signal proportional to"the differ-

ence in the conductivities of the reference and sample
gases is produced. The signals from the ‘two - con--

ductivity ‘cells are input to a dual-channel recorder
(ArcE1/2) on the sampler panel. =

The other two gas cylmders contain standard sample,
gases used for calibrating both conductivity cells. ‘The
gas pressure in these cylinders is reduced below 125 psig
by regulators PV-65A and PV-65B. These regulators are
equ1pped with mtegrally mounted gages which indicate
the inlet and outlet pressures locally. A second regu-
lator (PV- 64A) reduces the standard gas pressure to the
desired operating point. This regulator is also equipped
with integral gages which indicate the 1nlet and outlet
pressures locally. Since only one cyImder is used at a
time, the second-stage regulator is common to both
cylinders. . Pressure switches PS-64C1 and C2 and
PS-65B1 and B2 monitor the regulator outlet pressures
 

 

and initiate an alarm at the sampler panel and in the
main control room if these pressures are too high or too
low. A panel-mounted valve and a rotameter (FI-804),
similar to those used for the reference gas, control and
indicate the flow of standard gas to the system. Two
check valves are installed in the line between rotameter
FI-80A and the sampler system to prevent backflow
and possible escape of highly radioactive fission gases
during sampling operations. As a further precaution, a
manual block valve installed in this line is opened only
when standard gas flow is required. _
3.15.3.2 Pressure. Four pressure measurements are
made in the off-gas sampler. The pressures at the inlet
of the copper oxide scrubber and at the discharge of the
molecular sieve are measured by strain-gage-type abso-
lute pressure transducers PE-1A and PE-11A. The
output signals from these transducers are recorded at
the sampler panel by dual-channel recorder PR1IA/11A.
Excitation current for the strain gage transducers is
supplied by a pair of 5-V power supplies mounted in
the recorder. Backset switches PS1A and 11A in this
recorder initiate an alarm at the sampler panel and in
the main control room when either pressure is high.
~ The pressure at the vacuum pump suction is measured
by a 0- to 1000-u range Hastings vacuum gage and is
indicated on the sampler panel by indicator PI-40A.

The pressure at the discharge of the vacuum pump is
monitored by pressure switch PS41A, which initiates
an alarm at the sampler panel and in the control room
when the discharge pressure is high.
 3.153.3 Level. The level of liquid nitrogen in the

molecular sieve container is sensed by a Cryogenics,
Inc., model 100L dual-point level probe which also
controls the level by operation of solenoid valve
'LCV-SOA (see Sect. 3.15.4). The probe is basically a
gasfilled temperature sensor connected to a pressure
switch in the control unit by a capillary. The fill gas is
nitrogen. When the probe is immersed, the nitrogen fill
gas condenses and reduces pressure in the probe. When
~ the level drops, nitrogen in the probe evaporates, and
~ the resultant pressure increase in the probe operates the

switch. An indicator lamp on the control unit at the
sampler panel indicates whether the level is above or
below a preselected point. The solenoid valve controls
flow of liquid nitrogen from a supply tank located
outside sampler containment. The solenoid valve is
located at the tank. Backflow in the liquid nitrogen
supply line is prevented by two check valves.

A spark-plug-type electrical conductivity level probe

LE-OGS operates a magnetic-amplifier-type switch and

initiates an alarm at the sampler panel and in the main

control room if water leaks into the enclosure from the -

copper oxide scrubber cooling water line or from

- outside the containment.

3.15.3.4 Flow. A Hastings mass flow meter, model
1F 100X, with a range of 0 to 200 cc/min measures gas
flow in line No. 2. This flowmeter (FE2B) consists of
an electrically heated tube and an arrangement of
thermocouples which measure the differential tempera-
ture resulting from the cooling effect of gases passing
through the tube. The output signal is a dc voltage
proportional to the mass flow and specific heat of the
gas. This signal is almost insensitive to changes in gas
pressure and temperature, and wide variations in the
composition of the gas produce only small differences
in calibration. For this reason, the impurities in the
helium gas stream have a negligible effect on the
accuracy of the flow measurement. Heater power for
the element is supplied and controlled by a power
supply (FIXP-2B) located on the sampler panel. The
output signal is converted to a 10- to 15-mA signal by
emf-to-current converter FM-2B and used to operate
recorder FR-2B. The converter and recorder are located
in a common case on the sampler panel. The flow is also
indicated on a front panel meter on the power supply.

3.15.3.5 Temperature. Except for the bimetallic
thermostats used to control the block heaters on the

~ thermal conductivity cells, all sampler temperatures are

sensed by ;-in.-OD mineral-insulated, Inconel-sheathed
Chromel-Alumel thermocouples terminated in indi-
vidual quick disconnects inside the containment enclo-
sure. All lead wires from the disconnects are routed to
the sampler panel. Ten of the sixteen thermocouples

installed are input to multipoint temperature recorder

TR-3803, and three are installed spares. One thermo-
couple (TE-ABS-A) operates a contact-meter-type in-
dicator-controller (TI/TS-ABS-A) which controls the
heaters on the charcoal absorber and indirectly
(through the control circuit) operates an annunicator
(TA-COS-A) on the sampler panel. Another thermo-
couple (TE-COS-A) operates a similar indicator-

Arcontroller (TIC-COS-A) which has two contact switches
(TS<COSA1 and A2). One of these switches controls the

heaters on the copper oxide scrubber and indirectly
(through the control circuits) initiates a high-
temperature alarm. The second switch initiates a low-
temperature alarm. A common temperature annunci-
ator serves both the charcoal absorber and the copper

oxide scrubber.

Thermocouple TE MS-A operates recorder TR—MS -A.
This recorder has four backset switches (TS-MS-A2B,
A3B, A4A; and A4B) which are used by the control
circuit to control the heaters which evaporate liquid
nitrogen from the molecular sieve container and heat
 

 

 

 

 

 

the sieve (see Sect. 3.15.4). Another switch
(TS-MS-A1B) initiates an alarm at the sampler panel
and in the main control room when the sieve tempera-
ture is too I'ugh

3.15.4 Sampler Control

Figure 3.15.4 shows the-circuits which control the
heaters, blowers, vacuum pump, and molecular sieve
liquid nitrogen level in the sampler system. The supply

voltage to all circuits is 110 V ac. The molecular sieve

and cold trap heaters and the vacuum pump, which are
high-current loads, are supplied from the TVA bus
through instrument power panel No. 7. The rest of the
circuits are supplied from the reliable ‘power bus
through instrument power panel No. 3 (see Sect. 4.13).

3.15.4.1 Copper oxide scrubber heater. Circuit 1220
provides over-temperature protection for the copper
oxide scrubbers. Relay 1220 has contacts in series with
the scrubber heaters and must be energized to apply
power to the heaters. This relay is normal_ly held
energized by the flow of current through “stop”
contact S172A, hlgh-temperature contact TS-COS-A2,
and relay-operated seal contact K1220A. ngh scrubber
temperature causes contact TS-COS-A2 to open and
deenergize the relay, thus cutting off the heaters. When
the relay deenergizes, seal contact K1220A opens and
keeps the relay deenergized until the circuit is reset.
Momentary closure of “reset” contact S172B will
energize the relay and restore the circuit to operating
condition after the scrubber temperature has decreased
sufficiently to close contact TS-COS-A2. S172A and
S172B are contacts on a manually operated spring-
loaded rotary switch located on the sampler panel.
Power is applied to the scrubber heaters through a
manually operated circuit breaker (S173) and a Variac,
both’ of which are located on the sampler panel (see
circuit 1222). Lamps I-1220A and 1222A indicate the
conditions of circuits 1220 and 1222 at the panel. The
heater current is monitored by panel-mounted ammeter
E;I-COS-D.

- Similar circuits control..the heaters on the charcoal
absorber.

3.15.4.2 Molecular sieve mtrogen level. The level of

50

liquid nitrogen in the molecular sieve container is -

controlled by circuit 1223. Most of this circuit is in the
Cryogenics control unit (LIC-50A). This circuit controls

a solerioid (LCV-50A) in the liquid nitrogen supply line -

and has provisions for either manual or automatic
operation. When the selector switch is in the *“manual”
position the solenoid and relay No. 1 are continuously
energized, the amber “filling” lamp is lit, and the green

“satisfactory” rlami) will be lit until the upper contact
on level switch LS-50A opens. In this condition, filling
will continue until the switch is turned to either the
“off” or the “auto” position. When the switch is in the
“auto” position, filling will continue until the liquid
nitrogen level rises above the upper probe contact. At
this point, the solenoid and relay are deenergized, filling
stops, the “filling” lamp goes out, and the “satis-
factory” lamp comes on. The system stays in this
condition until the lower probe contact is opened due
to loss of nitrogen level, at which time the solenoid and
relay are again energized and the cycle starts anew. A
seal contact on relay 1 bypasses the lower probe
contact as soon as the relay is energized. This provides a
dead band action which ensures that the level will cycle
slowly between the upper and lower limits rather than
cycling at a faster rate around the lower limit.

3.15.4.3 Conductivity cell block heaters. Circuits
1213 and 1214 control the block heaters on the
conductivity cells. Manually operated circuit breakers
(S-166 and S-167), located on the sampler panel, allow
the heaters to be turned on or off. When the switches
are closed, panel lamps (I-1213A and I-1214A) are
turned. on and the heaters are controlled by the cell
thermostat switch (TS-AtcEl and E2). Panel lamps
1-1213B and 1-1214B indicate whether the thermostat
has turned the heaters on or off, —

.3.15.44 Recirculating air blower. Circuits 1216 and
1217 control the blowers which recirculate air in the
containment and radiation detector enclosures. The
blowers are connected directly across the line when
panel-mounted circuit breakers S-169 and S-170 are
closed. Panel lamps 1-1216A and I-1217A indicate
whether the breakers are open or closed.

3.15.4.5 Molecular sieve heaters. Circuit 1219 con-
trols a heater on the molecular sieve and another in the
liquid nitrogen bath surrounding the sieve. Three
switches on the molecular sieve temperature recorder
(TR-MS-A) control the heaters. Power is applied to the
circuits and heaters through manually operated circuit
breakers located on the sampler panel. The heaters are
needed only for transferring the sample collected in the
sieve to the transfer bottle and are turned off at all
other times. When liquid nitrogen is in the bath and the
circuit breakers are closed, switch TS-MS-A4B will be
closed, relay 3 will be energized, the lower (cold trap)
heater will be turned on, and the nitrogen will be
evaporated from the bath. After the nitrogen has -
evaporated, the temperature will rise. When the temper-
ature rises above 100°F, contact TS-MS-A4B opens and
contact TS-MS-A4A closes. This action deenergizes
relay No. 3 and turns off the lower heaters and, since
 

 

 

 

 

 

contact TS-MS-A2B and TS-MS-A3B are closed at this
time, energizes relays 1 and 2 and turns on the upper
heater. If the Variac which supplies the heater voltage is
properly set, the temperature of the sieve will continue
to rise until the temperature rises above 600°F and
contact TS-MS-A3B opens. The temperature of the
sieve will then be cycled around 600°F by the on-off
control action of contact TS-MS-A3B and relay No. 2.
If for some reason this control action fails and the sieve
temperature rises to 700°F, contact TS-MS-A2B will
open and cut off the heater through the action of relay
No. 1. The Variac is located on the sampler panel and is
adjusted to a position which gives good control and also
limits the maximum heater power to a value which
would not result in excessive sieve temperature should
the control fail. Two panel-mounted ammeters monitor
the current to the heaters.

3.154.6 Vacuum pump. Circuit 1215 controls the
vacuum pump. Power is applied to the pump through a
panel-mounted breaker (S-168). A panel-mounted lamp
(I-1215A indicates when this breaker is closed.

3.15.5 Annunciator Circuits

The annunciators used are the Tel-Alarm model TLPG
relay units mounted six to a panel above the sampler
panel. These units operate from normally closed field
contacts and utilize a common alarm, acknowledge, and
reset circuit. A relay, in parallel with the buzzer, serves
as a common repeater and operates an annunciator in
the main control room.

Annunciator RA-54A is a common alarm for the two
radiation detectors. High activity sensed by either
detector initiates an alarm.

Annunciator LA-OGS is operated from the spark-
plug-type level probe in the containment enclosure.
High water level in the enclosure initiates an alarm.

Annunciator FS-54C is a common low-flow alarm
operated by vane-type flow switches located in the

60

discharge of each of the blowers used to recirculate air

_in the containment enclosure. Low flow on gither unit

initiates an alarm.

- Annunciator TS-MS-A is operated from a backset
switch in the molecular sieve temperature recorder.
High molecular sieve temperature initiates an alarm.

Annunciator PA-65C is operated from pressure
switches in the high-pressure header from the standard
sample gas cylinders. High or low pressure initiates an
alarm. _

Annunciator PA-64B is operated from pressure
switches in the low-pressure header from the standard
sample gas cylinders. High or low pressure initiates an
alarm. , |

Annunciator TA-COS-A is operated from the contact
meter switches used to control the heaters on the
copper oxide scrubber. The low alarm is operated
directly by the contact meter. The high alarm is
operated by a contact on control circuit relay 1220
which is operated by the high-temperature contact on
the meter. Either high or low temperature initiates an
alarm. This annunciator is also operated by relay 1224,
which is, in turn, operated by the contact meter which
controls the temperature of the charcoal absorber. In
this case only high temperature initiates an alarm.

Annunciator PA41A is operated from a pressure
switch in the discharge of the vacuum pump. High
pressure at this point initiates an alarm.

Annunciator PA-61B is operated from pressure
switches in the reference helium high-pressure header.
Either high or low pressure initiates an alarm.

Annunciator PA-63B is operated from pressure
switches in the reference helium low-pressure header.
Either high or low pressure initiates an alarm.

Annunciator PA-1A is operated from backset switches
in the pressure recorder (one switch operated from each
signal). High pressure on either of these signals initiates
an alarm.

4. ELECTRICAL CONTROL AND ALARM CIRCUITS

P. G.‘ Herndon
R.L.Moore

T.M. Cate

4.1 GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The MSRE electrical control and alarm circuits
consist generally of a system of electrical contacts
interconnected in various logic arrangements to initiate
or inhibit control actions in the reactor systems and to
alert the operator, by operating alarms or indicator
lights, when abnormal conditions exist in the system.
Control and/or alarm actions are initiated either auto-
matically by instrument switches or manually by
hand-operated switches. The electrical circuits are
shown in Fig. 4.1.1 through 4.1.59, and the logic of the
contact arrangements is described by the block dia-
grams in Fig. 4.1.60 through 4.1.77. '

In many cases the instrument switches are actuated
indirectly by the use of pressure switches connected to
pneumatic transmission lines or from electronic
switches connected to electric transmission lines. In
other cases instrument switches are connected directly
to the process and are actuated directly by the process
(see Chap. 5). Two general types of manually (hand)
actuated switches are found in the MSRE: rotary and
push-button. Both types may have multiple contacts;
however, the push-button switches are usually single-
contact devices. Both types may have either main-
tained-contact or _spring-return action. Maintained-
contact switches remain in the selected position, while
spring-return - switches -return to their initial position
when released. Most rotary switches are multicontact,
multiposition devices. This type of switch is ‘used
mainly where variations in the mode of system or
equlpment operation require changes in circuit logic.

Contacts on the instrument and manual switches are
arranged in series, parallel, and senes-paraliel configura-
tions (depending on the logic decision required). The
resultant array is connected to devices such as relays,
contactors, timers, solenoid valves, indicator lamps, and
annunciators.

Relays are used to provide contact multiplication,

reversal of control action, and/or circuit isolation. In

many instances, one switch contact or circuit is
required to initiate or inhibit an action in several
separate circuits. In these instances the controlling
contact or citcuit operates a relay which supplies the
contact actions required for operation of the slave
circuits. In other instances, multiple-contact relays are
used to provide the electrical isolation required to
prevent “sneak™ circuits or to separate redundant safety
circuits. Reversal of contact action (normally open to
normally closed or vice versa) is usually combined, in
one relay, with the contact multiplication and/or
isolation functions; however, in some cases, single- or
multipoint-contact relays are used for this purpose
alone.

" Contactors are basically heavy-duty relays whose
contacts have the capacity to carry large currents. They
are used mamly for the control of heater and motor
loads.

The solenoid valves used in the MSRE are mag-
netically actuated control valves with quick-opening
(on-off) flow characteristics, The valves are operated by
energizing or deenergizing a solenoid coil. Two general
types of solenoid valves are used in the MSRE: two-way
and three-way. The two-way valves are used to shut off
flow in process or instrument lines. The primary use of
this type of valve in the MSRE is to'provide closure of
containment penetrations if unsafe conditions occur;
however, in some applications, such as found in the fuel
sampler-enricher system, they are also used for control
action. Three-way valves are used to switch the connec-
tion of an instrument or process line to one or the other

- of two similar lines. The primary use of this type of

117

valve is for control of pneumatically actuated valves. In
most of these applications the pneumatic valve actuator
is connected to a common port on the solenoid valve, a
second port is connected to an instrument air line, and
 

 

 

 

a third port is vented to atmosphere. When the solenoid
is energized, pressure is either applied to or vented from
the pneumatic valve actuator, causing the pneumatic
valve to either open or close, depending on the form of
the solenoid valve used. In some similar MSRE applica-
tions the third port is connected to another instrument
air line operated at a different pressure. This type of
connection is used where it is desired to switch the flow
in a process line to one or the other of two predeter-
mined values. The pneumatically actuated valves used in
these applications have throttling-type flow charac-
teristics, whereas those used for shutoff service have
quick-opening (on-off) characteristics.

The annunciators used on the MSRE are modular
relay-logic assemblies which produce audible and visual
signals when actuated by opening or closing an external
(field) contact. These devices are discussed in more
detail in Sect. 4.12.

Two grades of circuits are found in the MSRE

“control grade” and “safety grade.” Control-grade
circuits are used where a failure of control or a loss of
information or protective action (though undesirable)
can be tolerated. Safety-grade circuits are used where
such failures or losses cannot be accepted. The choice
between the two systems is based on considerations of
cost vs consequences. Safety systems involve the use of
redundant reliable instruments and interconnections
and tend to be more expensive than the control-grade
systems; hence, safety systems are used only where
necessary, and control-grade systems predominate. In
the MSRE, safety-grade circuits are used to prevent the
occurrence of conditions which could conceivably
result in a nuclear excursion or which could result in
the release of radioactive materials from the primary
containment system. Control-grade circuits are used to
provide routine control of the reactor system and
auxiliaries and to provide equipment protection and
visual and/or audible indications of abnormal or unsafe
conditions. In some cases, control circuits are also used
to forestall operation of safety-grade circuits by initiat-
ing automatic corrective actions such as control rod
reversal or closure of valves supplying helium purge.

The wiring layout of the MSRE control circuit is
arranged so that interconnections are centralized in the
main control area. With a few exceptions, all control
circuit wires are brought to terminal strips in the
“safety” and “‘control” relay cabinets. Circuit intercon-
nections are made within the cabinets. This arrange-
ment expedites trouble-shooting during shakedown and
operation and also expedites circuit revisions.

118

The layout of alarm circuit wiring is semicentralized;
that is, most alarm circuit wiring is brought directly to
annunciators in the main control area, but point-to-
point interconnection of series switches and intercon-
nection in field junction boxes is used extensively.

Control-grade and safety-grade wiring are kept sepa-
rate throughout the MSRE system, and separate cabi-
nets are used to house the control-grade and safety-
grade relays. Redundant channels of safety-grade
systems are also kept separate. This separation elimi-
nates the possibility of loss of redundancy due to short
circuits and aids in the identification of safety-grade
circuits. The wiring practices and coding systems used
in the MSRE are described in Sect. 7.2 of this report.

Except where large amounts of power are required for
operation of motors or heaters, all MSRE control
circuit voltages are either 48 V dc or 115 V ac, 60 Hz.

~ As discussed in Sect. 4.13, reliable power for operation

of the more important control circuits and instruments
is obtained from either the 48-V dc system or from
battery-powered static inverters. In some cases, redun-
dant power sources are used to enhance the reliability
of redundant safety circuits.

The remainder of this chapter discusses the operation
of the MSRE control and alarm circuits.- The intent of
this discussion is to enable a person with a reasonable
knowledge of instrumentation and control to under-
stand the operation of the MSRE circuits. The criteria
on which the control system is based are discussed in
Part II-A of this report (Chaps. 1 and 2), and
justification of the need for most reactor control and
safety interlocks will not be presented in this discus-
sion. However, the need for equipment protective
interlocks and the operation of circuits will be ex-
plained where it is not obvious.

The control and alarm circuits associated w1th the
sampling and enriching systems, the fuel processing
system, and the fuel off-gas sampler are not discussed
in this chapter. Since these are self-contained systems,
the discussion of circuits for these systems is incorpo-
rated in the process instrumentation subsystems discus-
sion of the sampling and enriching systems (Sect. 3.12),
the fuel processing system (Sect. 3.14), and the: fuel
off-gas sampler (Sect. 3.15).

Table 4.1.1 cross-indexes the control circuit numbers
with the numbers of the sectlons in this report where
the circuits are described. ‘

4.2 MASTER CONTROL CIRCUITS

The master control circuits enable the operator in the
main control room to manipulate those elements which
exert a direct and immediate influence on the status of
operating conditions in the reactor primary system. The
major elements involved are the helium supply and vent
valves, the transfer, fill, and drain freeze valves, the
circulating pumps, the control rods, and the radiator
components. The way these elements are used to
control the reactor system is described in Sects. 1 and 3
and will not be discussed here unless further explana-
tions are needed to clarify the operation of specific
circuits. The control elements make up parts of several
systems as shown in Figs. 1.4.3, 1.5.4, and 1.5.6. The

remainder of this section is intended to show how the
control circuits function to energize and deenergize
these elements.

The design of the master circuits, shown in Fig. 4.9,
4.11, and 4.12, is based on the philosophy that, while
necessary and desirable, administrative control alone is
not adequate to ensure safe and orderly operations. The
system is complex, with many valves and tanks, and the
probability of mis-operation is very high; therefore,
some restrictions, independent of operator judgment,
are needed to prevent operations that would result in
hazardous or undesirable conditions. Manual switches,
conveniently located on the console, and graphic panels
in the main control room give the operator command of
each control element. These elements must be manipu-

A
 

 

 

 

lated according to established procedures, and auto-
matic interlocks are combined with the manual switch
contacts in each circuit to ensure that the procedure is
followed. The restrictions imposed by the automatic
interlocks are removed only when correct valve posi-
tions, flows, temperatures, and pressures are established
in the system by the operator.

The system of logic around which the master control
circuits are designed is shown on the block diagrams in
Figs. 4.1.60 and 4.1.61. In general, the operator must
follow a three-step procedure to operate the reactor
system. First, he must commit the reactor to a
particular type or mode of operation by energizing the
operational mode selector circuits in the correct order.
This permits him to use some circuits, places specific
restrictions on the use of some, and prohibits the use of
others altogether. The next step is to select, by
manipulating manual switches, one of the several
specific operations permitted by the established mode.
Finally, another manual switch is used to actuate a
particular control element.

It should be noted at this point that the circuits
described above are used for normal operational pur-
poses. Nearly all of -the valves controlled by these
circuits also serve as safety block valves, and their

121

operation is further restricted by a separate set of relay

and switch contacts. These are safety-grade interlocks
actuated by safety-system instruments and located on
the end of the circuit nearest the final control element.
Safety-grade interlocks are represented by the shaded
blocks in the block diagrams. The elements deenergize
and return to the safe position if any of the contacts
~open. They override all other contacts, and the valves
cannot be energized again under any circumstances
until all safety contacts are closed. The safety system is
discussed in Sects. 1.5 and 4.7.

All of the valves and relays which make up the master
control circuits are supplied from the 48-V dc battery-
powered bus. This prevents unnecessary shutdowns
caused by momentary interruptions of TV A-supplied
electrical power and assures the continued operation of
those instruments and—control elements needed to
conduct an orderly shutdown during sustained outages
and other abnormal situations. The master -control
elements act toward shutdown when deenergized; that
is, they assume positions which permit a reactor drain.

The solenoid valve operating coils are almost pure
inductive Joads which generate high transient voltages
when the circuit is broken. These are often high enough
to sustain damaging arcs across the interlock contacts.
The silicon-diode—resistor combinations connected
across each coil, as shown in Fig. 4.2.4.1C, eliminate

the voltage peaks by effectively shorting out the current
induced in the coil when the circuit is opened. No
appreciable current flows through the diode when the
circuit is closed. The value of the resistor R is equal to
the resistance of the coil and prevents a damaging short
circuit in the event a diode fails.

4.2.1 Reactor Operational Mode Selector Circuits

The reactor is subject to several types or modes of
operation, each having different requirements. Since
each contro] element, such as valves and motors, must
be used for all modes of operation, it is necessary to
change the contact arrangements in the individual
circuits when changing from one mode of operation to
another. This is accomplished by using the operational
mode selector circuits.

The operating modes are manually selected and are
designated “off,” “prefill,” “operate,” “operate-start,”
and “operate-run.” A mode is established when the
relays in circuits 134 through 139 are energized (see
Fig. 4.1.11). The relays are energized when the operator
presses push buttons S8, S9, S10, S11, and S12,
assuming that all conditions imposed by the automatic
interlocks have been satisfied. These switches, with
integral indicator lamps, are located on the left side of
the operator’s console (see Fig. 4.2.1.1). Contacts on
the relays open and close the lamp circuits (see Fig.
4.1.39, circuits 486, 487, and 488) to indicate which
mode is in effect. A discussion of each mode circuit
follows: |

1. Off. This mode is not estabhshed by energizing a
relay but exists whenever relays K134 (“prefill” mode)

.and K136 (“operate” mode) are deenergized. The

operator can always return to the “off’ mode by
opening switch S8. In the “off” mode, restrictions are
imposed on the following circuits:

1. Circuits 115 and 116 are open — prohibits opening

2

fuel system helium supply valves.

Circuit 139 is open — prevents entenng ‘run” opera-

tional mode. This activates control rod reverse

circuit 186 and restricts manual operation of the

radiator doors under certain conditions (see Table

4.2.1.2).

. Circuit 147 is open — prevents startmg the fuel salt
pump.

4. Circuit 150 is open—prohlblts automatic load
control. :

. Circuit 170 is open — rod control servo is off.
 

 

. Circuits 174, 175, and 176 are open — prohibits
control rod withdrawal.

. “Permissive to thaw” circuits for transfer line freeze
valves (circuit A698 in Fig. 4.1.48 is typical) are
-open. Valves cannot be opened.

. “Permissive to thaw” circuits for fill and drain line
freeze valves (circuit A676, Fig. 4.1.47, is typical)
are open. Valves cannot be opened by normal
control functions but will open if emergency fuel
drain safety circuits call for a reactor drain.

2. Prefill. Relays K134 and K135 must be energized
to lift certain restrictions on the operation of the
transfer freeze valves, the helium supply valves, the fuel
and coolant salt pumps, and the reactor control rods. In
circuit 134 the first four series-connected contacts close
to indicate that all of the fuel salt is in the drain tanks
and that freeze valves FV-104, FV-105, and VF-106 in
the lines connecting the drain tanks to the reactor are
closed. When these four contacts close, relay K-135
energizes to close permissive interlocks in the transfer
freeze valve circuits (see Figs. 4.1.46 and 4.1.47),
permitting them to be opened upon request by the
operator. Relay K-134 can also be energized to establish
the “prefill” mode by closing push-button switch S9.
When relay K134 energizes, “prefill” mode is estab-
lished, and the master control circuits are altered as
follows:

1. Contact K134C closes to connect circuit 115 to the
supply bus. The helium supply valves are now

available for transfer operations.

. Contacts K134H and K134D close in circuits 142
and 147 to bypass permissive interlocks which have
no significance unless the pumps are full of salt. This
permits the operation of both the coolant- and
fuel-salt pumps to circulate helium through the
loops.

. Contact K134G closes in circuit 176 to remove
restrictions imposed on the control rod withdrawal
circuits.

3. Operate. Relays K136 and K137 must be ener-
gized to establish the “operate” mode before the fiil
and drain valves can be manipulated to fill the reactor
loop with fuel or flush salt. Neither relay will energize
until all of the transfer valves are closed. In circuit 136
the four series-connected contacts at the top end close
to signify that freeze valves FV107, FV108, and FV109
in the transfer lines are closed. When this occurs, relay
K137 energizes immediately and closes the “‘permissive
to open” interlocks in the fill and drain freeze valve

122

circuits (see Figs. 4.1.46 and 4.1.47). These valves now
open and close as requested by the operator, and one of
them must be opened before relay K136 will energize.
The three parallel-connected contacts K671B, KA682B,
and K693B are closed when these valves are open. After
all safety-circuit jumpers have been removed from the
jumper board, contact K149A closes, and the operate
mode is then established when the operator closes
push-button switch S10. Contact K149A closes when
circuit 149 is energized. For each safety jumper plug

~ inserted in the jumper board, one of the safety relays in

Fig. 4.1.21 is energized. One contact on each relay
closes to bypass a safety circuit interlock, and another

- opens to deenergize the “operate” mode permissive
P g p

interlock circuit 149. Each jumper relay in Fig. 4.1.21
is energized by the same control power bus or the
circuit in which safety interlocks are bypassed. Ob-
viously, contact K149A in circuit 136 cannot be closed
until all safety-circuit jumper plugs are removed.

The conditions imposed on other master control
circuits by energizing the “operate” mode relay K136
are described in Table 4.2.1.1. Also note that the
“prefill” mode relay K134 and the transfer valve
permissive relay K136 deenergize as soon as any one of
the three fill and drain freeze valves is opened. Thus,
transfers between drain tanks are prevented because
freeze valves FV107, FV108, and FV109 cannot be
opened and the drain tank helium supply valves cannot
be energized through transfer circuit 115.

4. Operate-start. The “operate” mode automatically
becomes ‘‘operate-start” (K138 energized) when the
reactor loop is filled to the correct level and the reactor
drain valve (FV103) is frozen (relay contacts K97A and
K695B in circuit 138 are closed). When relay K138 is
energized, one restriction preventing control rod with-
drawal is removed from circuit 174 (K138A closed).

circuits by energizing relay K136

This permits the reactor to start with power generation
exceeding 1.5 MW provided all other'conditions re-
quired for control rod withdrawal have been established
(see Sect. 2.6). The power generation is limited by
means of circuit interlocks in the radiator door control
circuitry which réquire that the reactor control system
be in the “operate-run” mode in order to raise the
doors and this demand power levels above 1.5 MW
(contacts KA139G and KB139D in circuits 162 and
164 must be closed — see Figs. 2.8. 9 and 2.8. 11). _

5. Operate-run. Relay K139 must be energized to
establish the “operate-run” mode of operations. This
relay will energize if the “operate” mode relay contact
K136A is closed, if all of the conditions required for
high-power operation have been satisfied, and if push-
button switch S11 in circuit 139 is closed. The
conditions required for high-power operation may be
established through several different paths in circuit
139, depending on whether or not the operator chooses
to control the reactor automatrcally or manually A
detailed explanation of the conditions required to close
each contact in this circuit is given in Sect. 1.4. Briefly,
circuit 139, shown in the simplified diagram of Fig.
4.2.1.2, operates as follows: One of the parallel paths
above switch S11 will be closed if one complete set of
nuclear instruments is functioning properly, and one of
the parallel paths between switch S11 and contact
K193D will also be closed if the operator has made the
correct selections for manual or for automatic control
of the rod drives and the load contro! elements. At this
pornt it should be noted that all of the above contacts
are permrssrve interlocks which havé no effect on the
crrcmt after relay K139 becomes energized and closes
seal-in contact K139A. Continuing down through the
circuit, one of the parallel paths between contacts
K223D and K166B will be closed :if one of the
wide-range nuclear instrument systems is functromng
properly and indicating that reactor power is at a level
greater than 0.2 MW. When the reactor power mcreases
to a value greater than 1 MW, the above contacts are

shunted by the “nuclear sag bypass” contacts: on relays
K208, K209, and K210. These are arranged in a two of.

three matrix to prevent the reactor from dropping out

of the “run” control mode when a single nuclear safety -

channel is deenergrzed The last contacts in the lower
end of the circuit will be closed if one radrator blower is
running and the fuel pump speed is above 1100 rpm
Once energlzed K139 will remain energlzed as long as
one radrator blower is running, the fuel pump speed is
above 1100 rpm, and the “operate” mode relay K136'is
energized. Table 4.2.1.2 describes the conditions im-
posed on other control circuits when the “run” mode is
established. -

4.2.2 Fuel-Salt Pump

The fuel-salt pump runs when the 500-A power
system circuit breaker D is closed, connecting the
pump s 75-hp three-phase electrical motor to a TVA
bus.! The operation of the breaker is controlled by the
mterlocks and relays in circuit 147, which is shown in
Figure 4.1.12. The operation of the circuit breaker will
be described ﬁrst since not only the fuel pump but also
the coolant-salt pump, the two component coolant
pumps, and the two main radiator blowers are supphed
through identical circuit breakers. Except for the
different logrc arrangements of the control interlocks,
the relay circuits controlling all of these breakers are
basically alike and, operate in the same way as those in
circuit 147. '

A typical breaker control relay circurt rs shown in Fig.
42.2.1a. The breaker closes when relay KA147 is
energized momentarﬂy and opens when relays KB147
and KC147 are deenergized. As long as relays KB147
and KC147 are deenergrzed the crrcurt breaker remains
open, and a cross interlock prevents relay KA147 from
being energized to close the breaker. To energize relay
KA147, both the group I and group II contacts as well
 

 

 

 

 

 

as push-button switch S33 must be closed. Once the
breaker closes, it is mechanically latched in this
‘position. The group 11 interlocks and relay KA 147 have
no further control as long as the breaker remains closed.
The breaker will remain closed unless the group I
interlocks open or the “stop” push button S32 is
opened to deenergize relays KB147 and KC147. The
breaker may also be opened by a mechanical trip lever

124

on the front of the enclosure or by the overload and

undervoltage trip coils which are integral parts of the
breaker latching mechanism.

The action of the circuit breaker is such that when
relay KA147 energizes closing contact KA147A, even
momentarily, the closing coil circuit (circuits shown in
Fig. 4.2.2.1b, which are associated with the operating
mechanism) is energized and seals itself in the energized
mode (relay KA 147 no longer has control). The breaker
closes and is held in this position by a spring-actuated
mechanical latch. As the breaker mechanism moves to
the “closed” position, the X contacts are opened by
mechanical action to deenergize the closing coil. The
closing action also closes an auxiliary contact a,
permitting the trip coil circuit to be energized upon
request. As soon as this contact closes, a small current
will flow through the trip coil and the sensitive
high-resistance relay DA. Relay DA will energize and
close the contact DA in the red indicator lamp (pump
running) circuit shown in Fig. 4.2.2.1c. If the red lamp
goes out while the breaker is closed, it is an indication
that the trip coil circuit is open and cannot be used to
open the breaker and stop the pump. If this occurs, the
mechanical trip lever must be operated to stop the
pumps. A second auxiliary contact b opens the green
(pump stopped) indicator lamp circuit.

The circuit breaker is opened by spring action when
the trip coil releases the mechanical latch. The spring
was compressed when the breaker moved to the
“closed” position. The trip coil is energized when relay
KC147 is deenergized. This relay deenergizes when any

of the group I interlocks open or the “stop” push-

button switch $32 is opened. The breaker will not close
until relays KB147 and KC147 are energized and the
“start” push-button switch is closed to energize relay
KA147. It should be noted that when KC147 is
energized there is a short time delay before contact
KC147A opens the trip coil circuit. This prevents the
circuit breaker from pumping (opening and closing
several times in rapid succession) in abnormal situations
such as simultaneous operation of the “start” and
“stop” push buttons or holding the “start” push button
closed when the overload trip is energized.

The arrangement of the group I and group II
interlocks in the fuel-salt pump control circuit 147 is
shown in Fig. 4.2.2.2. To start the pump, a path of
electrical continuity must be established through both
groups by contact closures. When the group I contacts

are closed, the breaker trip relays KB147 and KC147

are energized and the cross interlock contact KB147C
in group II is closed. The remaining contacts in group II
will be closed if the control rods are fully inserted and
the oil flows are above minimum operating require-
ments. Once these conditions are established, the circuit
breaker will close and start the pump when the “start”
push-button switch, S33, is closed momeniarily. The
group II interlocks are permissive to start only and have
no further effect on the operation of the pump as long
as the breaker remains closed. Once started, the pump
will continue to run unless one of the group I interlocks
or the “stop” push-button switch, $32, is opened
momentarily. - o

In Fig. 4.2.2.2 the group I contacts are labeled IA and
IB. The IB contacts, open when the coolant-salt pump
(CP) off-gas activity and the fuel pump (FP) cooling
water flow are abnormal, must always be closed to
operate the pump. The arrangement of the IA contacts
is altered by the operational mode selector circuits
and the fuel pump circuit breaker position. In the
“prefill” mode only helium is circulated in the fuel
system. All of the IA contacts, which represent condi-
tions that exist only when the loop is filled with fuel
salt, are bypassed by the closure of contact K134D and
have no effect on the operation of the pump. When the
“operate” mode is established, contact K134D opens,
contact KA136H closes, and all of the contacts in group
I must close before the pump can be started. When the
circuit breaker closes to run the pump, seal contact @
closes to bypass contacts KA136H, K659C, and
1.S593C4, and they are no longer required for the pump
to continue running. '

The circuit breaker closing coil is connected to the
same TVA bus which supplies the pump motor. This is
acceptable because the pump will not run unless TVA
or diesel generator power is available. The trip coil
power supply must be more reliable to assure that the
pump can be stopped at any time. For this reason the
trip coil is supplied by the 250-V dc station battery bus.
To isolate the 230-V ac and 250-V dc switchgear
control circuits from the 115-V ac system, relays
KA147, KB147, and KC147 are mounted in a terminal
box near the switchgear units in the switchgear room.
There is a separate relay box for each of the six motor
starting units mentioned previously.

423 Coolant-Salt Pump

The coolant-salt pump runs when power system
circuit breaker K closes and connects the pump motor
to a 480-V ac three-phase bus.> The circuit breaker is
identical to the one described in the previous section
for the fuel pump and is operated by control circuit
142, shown in Fig. 4.1.12. This circuit breaker can also
be operated by manual switch S127, which bypasses
circuit. 142 completely to run the pump in an emer-
gency situation.

.Except for the fact that it has fewer interlock
contacts, the arrangement of circuit 142 is identical to
fuel pump control circuit 147 (see Figs. 4.2.2.1 and
4.2.2.2). Here, as in the fuel pump circuit, a path of
electrical continuity must be established through both
the group I and group II interlock arrangements by
contact closures 'm order to start the pump. When the
group I contacts are closed, the breaker trip relays
KB142 and KC142 are energlzed and the cross interlock
contact KB142C in group II is closed. The remaining
contacts in group Il will be closed if the coolant drain
tank (CDT) freeze valves FV204 and FV206 are frozen
and the oil flows to the pump are above minimum
operating requirements. Once these conditions are
established, the circuit breaker will close and start the
pump when the “start” push-button switch, S35, is
closed momentanly The group Il interlocks are permis-
sive to start only and have no further effect on the
operatlon of the pump as long as the breaker. remains
closed. Once started, the pump will contlnue to run
unless one of the group I interlocks or the :“stop”

‘push-button switch, §34, is opened momentarily.

Again, as in the fuel pump circuit shown in Fig.

When *“‘operate” mode is established, contact K134H
opens, and all three interlock contacts in group I must
close before the pump can be started. Two level
interlocks are needed during startup in both the fuel-
and coolant-salt pump control circuits to accommodate
the drop in salt level which occurs after the pump
starts. The normal operating level is 8 to 12% lower

‘than is required for starting, and a single switch set to

42.2.2, the group I contacts in circuit 142 may be

‘considered in two parts. The single contact in the IB

part, which opens when the coolant-salt pump (CP)

cooling water flow is low, must always be closed to

operate the pump. The arrangement of the contacts in
the IA part is altered by the operational mode selector

circuits and the coolant pump circuit breaker position.
" There ‘is no “operate” mode requirement, but in the

“prefill” operational mode, contact K134H is closed
and both level interlocks are bypassed. Coolant-salt- -

level information is meaningless during “prefill” opera-
tions, when only helium is being circulated in the loop.

meet both level conditions would not leave enough
operating margin to prevent normal level fluctuations
from stopping the pump and shutting down the reactor.
When the circuit breaker. closes to start the coolant
pump, the “start” level interlock is sealed out of the
control circuit by the closing of circuit breaker auxil-
iary contact 4. Once started, only cooling water flow
and normal operating salt level must be maintained for
the pump to run continuously.

The “start” and “stop™ push-button switches and the
indicator lamps are located in the graphic symbol for
the coolant pump on the main control board. Pump
motor current and voltage indicators are located near
the symbol. Manual switch 127, also located on the
main board near the pump symbol, is connected
dlrectly in the power circuit breaker “close” and “trip”
coil circuits (see Fig. 2.8.17). This permits the operator
to override control circuit 142 completely and run the
coolant pump under emergency conditions as described
in Sect. 2.8.6.

4.2.4 Fnll and Drain System.

The fill and drain éystem provides for the orderly
movement of fuel salt between vessels in the reactor
primary system. The reactor vessel, the drain tanks, the

Jinterconnecting piping, and the control elements used

for- these operations are shown on the simplified
diagram in Fig. 1.5.4, Part IIA. Molten salt is forced out
of the vessels, excépt for the reactor core, which drains
by gravity, when helium pressure is applied to the gas
space in the supply vessel and vented from the gas space
in the vessel receiving the moving salt. Helium pressure
is supplied to the drain tanks, FD1, FD2, and FFT,
through main supply valve PCV-517A1 and branch line
valves HCV-572A1, HCV-574A1, and HCV-576A1 and
is vented to the charcoal bed filters ‘through valves
HCV-573A1, HCV-575A1, and HCV-577A1. The drain
tanks FD1, FD2, and FFT may also be vented to the
fuel pump bowl through bypass valves HCV-544A1,
HCV-545A1, and HCV-546A1. All of the valves have
spring-loaded pneumatic actuators.’ Air is supplied to
each actuator through a three-way solenoid valve as
 

 

 

 

 

shown in Fig. 4.2.4.1. When energized, the solenoid
valve connects the actuator to the air supply, and when
deenergized, the compressed air in the actuator is
vented to atmosphere. The helium supply valve actua-
tors are spring loaded to close when vented as shown in
b, while the vent and bypass valves are opened by spring
action as shown in part a of Fig. 4.2.4.1. See Sect. 6.8
for a description of the control valves used in the
MSRE. The valves just described, together with the
freeze valves in the interconnecting lines, control the
movement of salt between vessels. The movement is
controlled differently for each of the three reactor
operating modes. These modes are:

1. Prefill. Transfers are permitted between fuel drain

tanks only. The reactor vessel is isolated.

. Operate. Filling the reactor core vessel is permitted
from FD1, FD2, and FFT. The FST is isolated.

. Operate—run. Drain tanks FD1 and FD2 are pre-
pared at all times to receive salt when a reactor core
vessel drain occurs.

4.2.4.1 Drain tank helium supply valves. The only

way to open a helium supply valve and pressurize a
drain tank is to energize the appropriate solenoid valve
through either circuit 115 or 116, depending on which
operational mode is in effect. When “prefill” mode is
established, circuit 115 is connected to the control
power bus through contact K134C as shown in Fig.
4.2.4.2. Several features which prevent the possibility
of an accidental fill of the reactor vessel during transfer
operations should be noted here: the fill and drain
freeze valves FV104, FV105, and FV106 must close,
and the weight switches must indicate that all of the
salt is in the tanks before “prefill” mode can be
established. Once established, the valves’ permissive-to-
thaw circuits (see circuits A665, A676, and A687 and
Sect. 4.3) are deenergized. Therefore, all salt transfers
between tanks FD1, FD2, FFT, and FST must be
routed through transfer lines 107, 108, 109, and 110.
Transfers during nuclear power operations are not
permitted. At this point it is normal for both freeze
valves on a single tank to be closed, and it is possible for
pressure to build up in the tank even when the helium
-supply valve is closed, if it leaks. Under these conditions
an uncontrolled transfer could occur if one of the two
freeze valves were to open unexpectedly. To avoid this,
drain tank pressure switch interlocks operate in the
permissive-to-thaw circuits (see circuits A698, A709,
A720, and A731) and prevent the transfer freeze valves
FV107,FV108, FV109, and FV110 from opening unless
the pressure in the selected tank is less than 5 psig. This
low-pressure interlock is automatically bypassed in each

126

circuit when the freeze valve opens so that the valve will
remain open when the tank is pressurized to transfer
salt. Also, if both freeze valves on a tank are open,
interlocks in circuits 117, 118, and 119 prevent the
tank’s vent valves from closing. The fuel storage tank is
at the same elevation as the reactor vessel. If line 110
filled with salt and both freeze valves on a tank were
then thawed, salt would siphon directly into the
reactor.

Once the reactor core vessel is isolated, transfer
operations may take place between any two of the four
fuel storage tanks. Since they may be in either
direction, 12 different transfer operations are possible.

For each operation, two specific freeze valves are

opened and six others are closed. To avoid transfers
other than those intended, the contacts of supply tank

" selector switch S5 and receiver tank selector switch S4

are combined with freeze valve position and drain tank
pressure interlock contacts to prevent the helium
supply valves from being energized and applying pres-
sure to a tank unless:

1. the supply selector switch is set to select that tank as
the supply tank and the freeze valve connecting the
selected tank to the transfer lines is open (this is

accomplished in contact matrix III in Fig. 4.7.4.2);

. the receiver selector switch is set to select a tank
other than the selected supply tank (also in matrix
III) and the freeze valve -connecting the selected
receiver tank to the transfer lines is open (matrix II);

. all other freeze valves connected to the transfer lines
are closed (this is accomplished in matrix I);

. the pressure in the selected tank is less than the
maximum allowed and the manual switch for the
valve supplying helium to the selected tank is closed
by the operator (Matrix V);

. the nuclear safety system interlocks in matrix VI are
closed.

All of the supply valves are subject to the above
restrictions except PCV-517A2, which is always ener-
gized unless one of the safety interlocks in matrix VI is
open. The FST supply valve can be energized only when
the system is in the “prefill” operating mode and is
subject to additional restrictions imposed by matrix IV.
The contacts in this matrix prevent the FST from being
pressurized unless:

1. the weight switches indicate that the selected re-
ceiver tank is nearly empty and the bypass valve on
this tank is open, ;
 

 

 

 

O

2 the temperature switches in circuits 101 and 102
indicate that the temperature of the ring-joint flange
cover on the fuel-salt filter (FSF) in line 110 is less
than the maximum allowed.

Selector switches S4 and S5 are the rotary type with
cam-operated contacts which maintain their position
when the operating handle is released. They are located
in the main control room on the part of the console
shown in Fig. 4.2.1.1., and each switch has four
positions identified FST, FD1, FD2, and FFT. Manual
switches for each helium supply valve are located in the
valve symbol near the drain tanks on the main control
board. :

To illustrate the operation of circuit 115, assume that
drain tank FD1 is full of fuel salt, that “prefill” mode is
established, switch S4 is turned to position FD2, and S5
to position FD1. As a result, contacts marked * thus are
closed. Further assume that the operator has closed and
opened the appropriate freeze valves and that tank
pressures as well as safety measurements are not out of
acceptable limits. If these assumptions prevail, contacts
marked ** thus are closed. Except for manual switch
HS572A1, the circuit to the FD1 helium supply valve is
now complete. This switch may be closed at the

“operator’s discretion to pressurize FD1, forcing salt out

of FD1 and into FD2. The movement of salt may be
stopped at any time by opening the switch. Notice how

‘the supply and receiver selector switches force the

operator to establish the correct combination of open
and closed freeze valves for the desired transfer before
the helium valve can be opened to pressurize the tank.

To conduct reactor core vessel fill operations, the
same - helium supply valves, except FST valve HCV-
520A2, must again be energized -~ this time through
circuit 116. Circuit 116 is connected to the control
power bus through contact KA136C, which closes when
the “operate” mode of operations is established. Again,
as in “prefill” mode, the interlock arrangement includes
several protective features which prevent uncontrollable
movements of salt between tanks and to the core vessel.

Before the “‘operate” mode can be established, the
transfer lines must be closed and at least one fill and
drain valve must be opened. The transfer line freeze

127

valves FV107, FV108, and FV109 are closed to isolate -

the FST from the other tanks. Once “operate” mode is
established, the valves’ permissive- -to-thaw circuits are
deenerglzed (see circuits A698, A709, and AT720), and
all salt transfers between the reactor vessel and the
drain tanks must be routed through fill lines 103,104,

105, 'and 106. During the changeover phase from

“prefill” to “operate” mode it is normal for both freeze

valves on a single drain tank to be closed. Here again the
tank could be pressurized through a leaking supply
valve, and if one of the freeze valves opened unex-
pectedly, the reactor vessel could be unintentionally
filled with fuel salt. This is prevented by differential
pressure interlocks which operate in the permissive-to-
thaw circuits (see circuits A665, A676, and A687) to
keep the fill and drain freeze valves FV104, FV105, and
FV106 from opening unless the pressure in the tank
associated with a particular valve is less than 5 psig
greater than the pressure in the fuel pump bowl. After
the freeze valve opens, this interlock is bypassed so that
the valve will remain open when the tank is pressurized
to fill the reactor vessel. Also, as described for “prefill”
operations, the drain tank vent valves cannot be closed
if both freeze valves on a tank are closed.

With *“‘operate” mode -established, some additional
conditions must be satisfied before circuit 116 can be
energized to fill the reactor vessel. These are:

1. Freeze valve FV103 must be closed (matrix VII).

2. Nuclear instruments must be working properly
(matrix VIII). Contact K195A and the weight switch
WQS-1002A2-A1 are closed when the reactor vessel
is less than half full of fuel salt and operating at the

~neutron source level. When flush salt is used, the
weight switch is bypassed by the drain selector
switch contact S6R. With the vessel full of fuel salt,
the wide-range counting channels are needed, and
either contact K193E or 194E must be closed.

3. The fuel pump must be “off" and the levei of salt in
the pump bowl must be below the maximum
allowed (matrix IX).

~ All of the requirements for energizing circuit 116
mentioned to this point are preliminary to the start of

actual fill operations, but they must prevail continu- .

ously during this operation or the helium supply valves
will open and stop the flow of salt mto the reactor
vessel.

The reactor vessel may be connected dlrectly to and

filled from any one of three tanks: FD1, FD2, and

FFT. To prevent transfers between tanks and uninten-
tional fills, the contacts of drain tank selector switch S6
are combined with fill and drain freeze valve position
and drain tank pressure interlock contacts to prevent
the helium supply valves from being energized and
appiying pressure to a tank unleSs: e

1. the drain tank selector sthch is set to select that
tank (matrix X), - o
 

 

 

2. the fill and drain freeze valve connecting the selected
tank to the reactor vessel is open and all valves on
the other tanks are closed (matrix X),

3. the pressure in the selected tank is less than the
maximum allowed and the manual switch for the
valve supplying helium to the selected tank is closed
by the operator (matrix V),

4. the nuclear safety system interlocks in matrix VI are
closed.

To illustrate the operation of control circuit 116,
assume again that drain tank FD1 is full of fuel salt,
freeze valve FV106 is open, drain selector switch S6 is
turned to position FDI, and “operate” mode is
established. Contacts marked * thus are closed. Assume
further that the operator. has closed the other drain
tank freeze valves, that the status of the fuel pump,
freeze valve FV103, and the nuclear instruments is
correct, and that tank pressures as well as safety
measurements are not out of acceptable limits. If these
assumptions prevail, contacts marked ** thus are
closed. Again manual switch HS557A1 may be closed at
the operator’s discretion to pressurize FD1 and force
fuel salt up and into the reactor vessel.

Drain tank selector switch S6, also located on the part
of the console shown in Fig. 4.2.1.1, is the same type as
S4 and S5, but it has only three positions: FD1, FD2,
and FFT. It is equipped with a solenoid-operated latch
to prevent the operator from switching into or out of
the FFT position unless he first closes push-button
switch S112 to release the latch (see circuit 93 in Fig.
4.1.8). The flush salt tank FFT is not equipped to
- contain fuel salt, and the latch is a positive reminder
that the switch must be in either the FD1 or FD2
position when fuel salt is in the reactor vessel. Also,
moving the switch to the FFT position automatically
adjusts the calibration of the fuel pump bowl level
measuring instruments to compensate for the difference
in the densities of the fuel and coolant salts. This is
accomplished through circuit 94, Fig. 4.1.8. In the FFT
position, switch contact S6T is closed and relays KA94
and KB94 are energized. Contacts on these relays
operate in the output signal circuits of the fuel pump
level transmitters, LT-593C and LT-596B, to adjust the
indicated salt level as described in Sect. 6.23.

- With the reactor vessel full of salt, the operator closes
EV103. Contact K660B opens to deenergize circuit 116
and close all of the helium supply valves.

There is one exception to the rule that prevents salt
transfers between tanks FD1 and FD2 through fill lines
105 and 106. It is standard operating procedure to keep
two freeze valves, FV105 and FV106, open when the

128

reactor is operating. This provides additional assurance
that a drain is always possible, but when an unexpected
drain does occur, a part of the salt goes to each drain
tank. To refill the reactor vessel using normal pro-
cedures, the control system must be returned to the
“prefill” mode, and all of the salt must be transferred
to one tank or the other through transfer lines 108 and
109. In this case the time required by the normal
procedure is excessive; therefore, jumpers are provided
in circuit 116, matrix X, to bypass contacts KA681C
(FV105 closed) and KA692C (FV106 closed) — see Fig.
4.1.9. This allows fuel salt to be transferred between
drain tanks FD1 and 2 through lines 105 and 106.
Although this procedure does involve some risk of
transferring fuel to the reactor vessel, the vessel is
prepared for a fill anyway; therefore everything is safe
should one occur inadvertently.

The helium supply valves also serve as safety block
valves. Since PCV-517A2 combines with HCV-572A2,
HCV-574A2, and HCV-576A2 to form redundant pairs,
the safety interlocks and wiring in matrix VI of circuit
127 and those in the same matrix of circuits 115 and
116 are installed in separate conduits.

Helium is admitted to pressurize the coolant drain
tank by closing hand switch HS-511A1 in circuit 126

(Fig. 4.1.9); HS-511A1 is located on the main control

board. Closing the switch will energize the solenoid to
open supply valve HCV-511A1 unless the safety system
demands an emergency drain (contacts KA140E and
KA141E open) or the helium supply pressure is low
(contacts KC40F and KC41A open). During filling
operations contacts K100C and K107C also open to
close the supply valve and stop the fill if pump bowl
level or the drain tank pressure becomes too high.

4.2.4.2 Drain tank vent valves. Before a tank can be
pressurized, both the bypass and vent valves on the
selected tank must be closed. The vent valves on FDI1,
FD2, and FFT close when the solenoids in circuits 117,
118, and 119 are energized. The contact arrangements
in all three circuits are identical, and the circuit shown
in Fig. 4.2.4.3 is typical. Normally all three valves are
closed unless a transfer, fill, or drain operation is in
progress. They will remain closed . as long as the
following conditions exist:

1. At least one of the freeze valves associated with each
tank is closed (matrix II). It was explained pre-
viously that this helps prevent accidental transfers
and fills. It is one of the requirements for estab-
lishing “operate” mode.

2. There is no request for a normal drain, and the fuel
drain demand switch (S7) contacts of matrix I are
closed in all three circuits.

g},
 

 

oo S i .

129

3. The level in the pump bowl is not high, the pressures
in the tanks are not high, there is no request for an
emergency drain, and all of the interlock contacts in
matrices Il and V are closed.

4. The manual switch contacts in matrix IV are
shunted by the bypass valve position interlocks. This
prevents the pump bowl from being pressurized
when the helium supply valve opens.

As soon as the bypass valve on the selected drain tank
(determined by the position of switch S6) closes, the
contact shunting the manual switch (K103C in circuit
117) opens, allowing the vent valve to open. At this

point the operator uses manual switch HS573A2,

located on the main board, to open and close the
supply tank vent valve as required for transfer and fili
operations. For a transfer from one tank to another, the
same procedure is followed to close and then open the
bypass and vent valves on the receiving tank. If, during
a reactor filling operation, the selected drain tank
pressure or the pump bowl level exceeds preset limits,
the interlock contacts in matrix III open to relieve the
pressure in the tank and lower the level of salt in the
pump bowl. Both the vent valve and the bypass valve on
the selected drain tank are opened when a drain is
initiated. Since both of these valves are controlled by
identical contact arrangements in matrix I, the opera-
tion of the drain tank selector switch (S6) and the fuel
drain switch (87) will be discussed in the following
séction after the bypass valve circuits are described.
The use of the FST vent valve, HCV-692AI, is
restricted by control-grade interlocks which operate
automatically to protect’ the tank from excessive

" pressures and prevent accidental transfers of salt to the
“other drain tanks and the reactor vessel. The solenoid

valve in circuit 120 (Fig. 4.2.4.3) must energize and
close the vent valve before the FST can be pressurized.
The solenoid will energize when the operator closes
main board switch HS-692A2 (matrix VHI), prowded

the followmg required COIldlthl'lS are in force:

L The drain tank pressure is not high (contact K1 12C

closed).

2. All of the valves in at least one of the three sets

listed below are closed to isolate the reactor vessel

_ from the FST. The contacts are shown in matrix VII
of Fig. 4.2.4.3. - '

a- Drain tank freeze valve FV1 10 frozen (contact

~K736C closed).
b. Fill and drain freeze valves FV104 FVIGS and
FV106 frozen (contacts K703E, 714E, and 725E
closed).

" ¢. Transfer freeze valves FV107, FV108, and
FV109 frozen (contacts KA670F, KA681F, and
© KA692F closed).

FST vent valve HCV-692A is open when fuel is
processed, and the resulting off-gas, which contains
hydrogen, is discharged into containment air duct 940.
As long as sufficient air flow is maintained,- the
concentration of hydrogen in the duct will not become
great enough to form an explosive mixture. The flow
rate is monitored by switch FS940B2, which remains
open if the rate of flow in the duct is above the
minimum required. Switch S113 is closed when process-
ing operations begin, but the FST vent valve remains
open unless .the flow in the duct drops below the
minimum required. In that case circuit 120 is energized
to close the vent valve and shut off the flow of offgas
from the tank.

A lamp located near switch S113 on the main control
board gives visual indication that contact S113A is
closed and flow interlock FS940B2 is in the valve
circuit. The lamp is energized through contact S113B in
circuit 429 (Fig. 4.1.37).

‘The operator manipulates manual switch HS547A2,
on the main control board, to energize the solenoid in
circuit 121 and close the coolant drain tank (CDT) vent
valve HCV547A1. Automatic control-grade interlocks
open to deenergize the solenoid and prevent the valve
from closing if:

1. 'tttere is an emergency coolant drain demand (con-
- tacts KA140A and KA141A open),

2. pressure in the CDT is excessive (cdntact K107A
opens),

3. the level of the salt in the coolant pump bowl is too

high (contact K100A opens); during a fill operation

- this will allow salt to drain back into the CDT and
- lower the level in the pump bowl.

4243 Dram tank bypass valves. The drain tank .
bypass valves HCV-544A1, HCV-545A1, and HCV-
546A1 close when control circuits 131, 132, and 133
are energized. The contact arrangements in all three
circuits are identical, and. the circuit shown in Fig.

42.4.3 is typical. When the reactor vessel is empty,
there is no request for a normal drain, and all of the S7
switch contacts in matrix I are closed. If the require-
ments. for filling are satisfied, the safety interlocks in
matrix VI are also closed, and the operator may open
and close the bypass valves by manipulating manual
switches ‘HS-544A2, HS-545A2, and HS-546A2, all
located on the main control board. When there is no

 
 

 

demand for a drain, the operator has the option of
leaving the valves open or closed, but normally they are
energized and remain closed.

The most important interlock function is to deener-
gize the solenoids and open the bypass valves when a
drain is initiated. Opening the bypass valves allows the
pressures in the fuel pump bowl and the drain tank gas
spaces to equalize so that the salt drains freely from the
reactor vessel into the selected tank. A drain may be
initiated by the operator, in which case the selector
switch contacts in matrix I open, or it may be initiated
automatically by the emergency drain circuits. In either

case, as previously stated, both the vent and bypass.

valves are opened when a drain is initiated.

Under emergency conditions the contacts in both
matrices V and VI operate to open the valves on all
three tanks. The safety interlocks in these matrices and
the valves are redundant, since either the bypass or the
vent valve provides the venting action necessary for a
successful drain. The reactor vessel will not drain
completely if only the vent valve opens, but the drain
will be sufficiently complete to preclude a nuclear

excursion or a major salt spill. For this reason the safety
portions of these circuits are physically separated, as

described in Sect. 7.2.

Under normal conditions the drain is initiated by the
operator, and only those valves on the tank selected to
receive the salt are deenergized by the opening of
contacts in matrix I. The position of drain tank selector
switch S6 determines which one of the three tanks will
receive the salt when a drain does occur. This switch
must always be in one of three possible positions, FDI1,
FD2, or FFT. Lamps mounted in the drain tank graphic
symbols on the main control board are also energized

through contacts on switch S6 to visually identify the

selected drain tank. The lamp circuits are shown in Fig.
424.4. The S6 switch contacts in the circuits that
control the vent and bypass valves connected to the
selected drain tank are always open, and the selected
circuits are energized through the normal drain switch
(S7) contacts only. This is the condition of the circuits
shown in Fig. 4.2.4.3. The S6 contacts in the circuits
that control the other vent and bypass valves are closed,
and these circuits remain energized through both the S6
and S7 switch contacts. A normal fuel drain is initiated
when switch 87, which is located on the operator’s
console as shown in Fig. 4.2.1.1, is turned to the
“drain” position. In this position all of the S7 contacts
open. The valves connected to the selected tank open
since both contacts in matrix I are now open, but the
valves connected to the other tanks remain closed since

130

the solenoids are still energized through the S6 contacts
in matrix I.

To illustrate, assume that drain tank selector switch
S6 is left in the FDI position after the filling operation
described in a previous example. Contacts S6C and S6D
in matrix I of Fig. 4.2.4.3 are open, but the circuits are
completed through contacts A and D on fuel drain
switch S7, which is in the “off” position. As soon as
switch S7 is turned to the “drain” position, contacts A
and D open to deenergize circuits 117 and 131, and
both valves on the selected drain tank, FD1, open. The
circuits controlling the valves connected to the other
tanks, FD2 and FFT, remain energlzed through the
closed S6 contacts.

Once the reactor vessel is filled with salt, a drain
could occur at any time; therefore the selected drain
tank must be maintained ready to receive salt at all

. times. The selected drain tank is in condxtlon to receive

salt if:

1. the bypass valve is open,
2. the weight of salt in the tank is low,

3. the freeze valve connecting the tank to the fill line is
open, . _ '

4. the freeze valves connecting the other tanks to the
fill line are closed.

The operator is responsible for maintaining these
conditions when the reactor vessel is full of salt. If the
selected tank is not in condition to receive a drain,
circuit 803, also shown in Fig. 4.2.4.4, produces an
audible and visual alarm in the main control room. This
circuit monitors conditions in all three tanks, but
contacts on drain tank selector switch S6 bypass all
except those which represent conditions in the selected
tank (see the logic diagram in Fig. 4.1.72). Operating
procedures require that both FD1 and FD2 be main-
tained ready to receive a drain when fuel salt is in the
reactor vessel. When switch S6 is in either of these
positions, circuit 803 will produce an alarm if either or
both FD1 and FD2 are not in condition to receive a
drain. When switch S6 is in the FFT position, the FD1
and FD2 interlocks are bypassed, and only those
contacts which represent conditions in FFT will pro-
duce an alarm.

Circuit 130 energizes to close the coolant drain tank
(CDT) vent valve HCV-527A1. The circuit will energize
when manual switch HS527A on the main control
board is closed unless the control system demands an
emergency drain, in which case the control-grade
interlock contacts KA140C and KA141C open.

'4.2.5 Pump Bowl Helium Purge Valves

Valves FCV-516B! and FCV-512A1 are the final
elements in control systems which regulate the flow of
helium purge gas to the fuel- and coolant-salt pump
bowls. These systems are described in Sect. 3.5. In
addition to automatic flow control, the valves also
provide safety blocking action. The pneumatic operator
on each valve is connected to a flow controller through
three-way solenoid valves FCV-516B2 and FCV-512A2.
When the solenoid valves in circuits 128 and 129 (see
Fig. 4.1.9) are energized, the control valves are throt-
tled by the air signals from the controllers to regulate
the flow rate of helium purge gas entering the fuel- and
coolant-salt pump bowls. This is the mode of operation
for normal conditions. There are no manual switches in
either circuit, and both are energlzed continuously
unless:

1. pump bowl pressure is too high, in which case
switches PSS-522A and PSS-528A open and deener-
gize the solenoid valves,

2. helium supply pressure is too low, in which case the
contacts actuated by safety system relays KB40 and
KB41 open and deenergize the solenoid valves.

In either case the instrument air signal from the
controller is shut off, the control valve operator is
vented to atmosphere, and the valves close. The
pressure switches in the first case are control-grade
interlocks, but the relay contacts in the second case are
safety-grade interlocks, since the valves must close to
block the escape of radloactlve gas from the pump
- bowl.

4.2.6 Pump Bowl Vent Valves

The fuel- and coolant-salt pump bowl vent valves
prowde a low-resistance path for venting helium cover
gas from the pump bowls to the off-gas system, as

shown in Figs. 1.5.4 and 1.5.8, Part IIA. In the fuel

system the path provided through HCV-533A1 bypasses
' the particle trap and the main charcoal beds in line 522

to vent the pump bowl directly to the -auxiliary

charcoal beds. Vent valve HCV-536A1 in the coolant

system bypasses pressure control valve PCV-528A to

vent the pump bowl dlrectly to the contamment air
system '

The vent valves open when the solenoid valves shown
in circuits 122 and 123 (Fig. 4.1.9) are deenergnzed ‘For
normal operating procedures the valves are controlled
manually at the operator’s discretion with hand
switches, HS-533A2 and HS-536A2, located on the

main control board. The only automatic restrictions
imposed on the operation of either valve are in circuit

122, where safety-grade interlock contacts K22C and

K23C open to prevent valve HCV-533A1 from closing
unless the fuel pump bowl pressure is less than 25 psig
(see Fig. 4.1.2).

4.2, 7 Normal Fuel Drain

A normal, or routine, fuel drain is initiated when
switch 87, which is located on the operator’s console as
shown in Fig. 4.2.1.1, is turned to the “drain” position.
As described in Sect. 4.2.4.3, switches S6 and 7 operate
to assure that the selected drain tank is always ready to
receive salt when the reactor vessel is full. The freeze
valve on the selected tank is also open, and 2 drain will
occur if drain valve FV103 opens.

When switch S7 is turned to “drain,” the vent and

“ bypass valves on the selected tank open immediately,
- and contact S7G closes in circuit 148, Fig. 4.1.12. One

of the three parallel-connected contacts, S6N, S6P, and
S6Q, will also be closed depending on the position of
drain tank selector switch S6. If the freeze valves on the
tanks other than the one selected are frozen, relay
K148 energizes and contact K148A opens in circuit
A655, Fig. 4.46, to thaw reactor drain valve FV103.
For instance, if switch S6 is in the FDI1 position,
contact S6N is closed. Contacts KB670A and KB681A,
connected in series with S6N, also close to complete the
circuit through relay K148 if freeze valves FV104 and
FV105 on drain tanks FFT and FD2 are frozen. The
logic diagram for circuit 148 is shown in Fig. 4.1.73.

428 ébolant Syétem Drain Demand

When either one or both of the coolant drain demand
circuits 140 and 141, shown in Fig. 4.1.12, deenergize, .
the coolant drain tank (CDT) vent and bypass valves
open, the CDT freeze valves thaw, and the salt in the
coolant circulating loop, including the radiator, drains
into the CDT (see Fig. 4.2.8.1). These actions are

-accomplished by the following relay contact ‘opera-

thl’lS

1, Contacts KA140A and KA141A open in circuit 121
“to open the CDT vent valve HCV-547A1.

2. Contacts KA140C and KA141C open in circuit 130
" to open the CDT bypass valve HCV-527A1 .

3. Contacts KA140E and KA141E open in circuit 126

to close the CDT helium supply valve HCV-511A1.

‘4. Contacts KB140A, KB141A, and KB140D open in

circuits B765, A765, and 776 to thaw freeze valves
FV204 and FV206.
 

 

 

5. Contacts KA140D and KA141D open in circuit
1083 to annunciate in the main control room.

Conversely, the coolant-salt system cannot be filled
unless circuits 140 and 141 are energized.

Both routine and emergency drains are initiated by
opening contacts in the drain demand circuits. For
routine operations contacts S95A and 95C open when
manual switch S95 on the operator’s console (see Fig.
4.2.1.1) is turned to the drain position. Emergency
action is required if the coolant-salt temperature at the
radiator outlet becomes abnormally low. When this
occurs, three independent temperature measuring chan-
nels operate switches TSS202A2, TSS202B2, and
TSS202C2 to deenergize the relays in safety circuits 4,
5, and 6 (see Fig. 4.1.1). Contacts on these relays are
connected in a two-out-of-three coincidence matrix in
circuits 140 and 141 so that if any two of the relays are
deenergized, circuits 140 and 141 will also be deener-
gized to injtiate a coolant system drain.

Although arranged in a one-out:of-two configuration
for increased reliability, circuits 140 and 141 are not
safety grade. They are actually control-grade extensions
of the load scram circuits described in Sect. 2.8.6. The
temperature switches in circuits 4, 5, and 6 are
identified in Fig. 1.5.2 (Part IIA) as input reference
number XVIII. Circuits 140 and 141 provide corrective
action 3.c resulting from input reference condition
number XVIII in Table 1.5.1, Part IIA.

42.9 Afterheat Removal System

Circuits 143, 144, and 145 in Fig. 4.1.12 control
cooling water supply valves HCV-882C1, FSV-806A,
and ESV-807A in the drain tank afterheat removal
system. This system is shown in Fig. 1.5.7 and is
described in Section 1.5.3, Part IIA. For normal
operating conditions the contacts in the circuits are
closed and all three valves are energized. Both ESV-
806A and B are direct-acting two-way solenoid valves
which close when energized. HCV-882-C1 is a pneuma-
tically operated three-way valve, which is controlled by
three-way solenoid valve HCV-882-C2 in circuit 143.

If the temperature of the fuel salt in drain tank FD1
exceeds 1300°F, temperature switches open auto-
matically to deenergize control relay K258 in Fig.
4.1.20. This opens contact K258A in circuit 144 to
deenergize ESV-806A, which opens to allow maximum
water flow to the steam dome on fuel drain tank FD1.
When the fuelsalt temperature decreases to 1200°F,
the temperature switches automatically reclose, and
ESV-806A returns to the closed position. ESV807A
supplies water to the steam dome on fuel drain tank

132

FD2 and is controlled by circuits 259 and 145, which
are identical to those just described.

Normally the steam dome condensers are supplied
with tower cooling water, but diversion valve HCV-
882-C1 provides an alternate supply of water. When
cooling tower water pump. discharge pressure falls
below a minimum value, pressure switch PS-851-B1 in
circuit 143 opens to deenergize solenoid valve HCV-
882-C2. This causes HCV-882-C1 to change positions
and shift the cooling water supply from the tower to
the process water main. The valve may also be
controlled by manual switch HS882C, which is located
in the water room (WR) on the water panel (WP).

4.3 FREEZE VALVES
4.3.1 Introduction

The flow of salt in the MSRE fuel and coolant
systems is controlled by freezing or thawing a short
plug of salt in a flattened section of 1%-in.-diam pipe
called a freeze valve. A simplified version is illustrated
by the schematic diagram shown in Fig. 4.3.15. In this
discussion the flat section is referred to as the center,
and the transitions from the flat to the round sections
are referred to as shoulders. The small pots in the lines
on either side of the valve are called siphon breaks. The
extra volume of salt contained in these pots and the
pipe configuration ensure that the freeze valve section
will always be full of salt.

The valve freezes {closes) when a cooling stream of
gas,* directed against the center section, causes the salt
contained there to solidify. A gas flow of 15 to 35
scfm! will freeze a valve, initially at 1200°F, in 15 to
30 min if the salt is not flowing. A valve cannot be
frozen if salt is flowing through it. Once the valve
freezes, the gas flow is reduced to 3 to 7 scfm,! arate
which is sufficient to maintain the frozen condition but
not enough to extend the size of the plug.

The valve thaws (opens) when the flow of cooling gas
is stopped. The heat conducted along the pipe wall
from the pipe line heaters adjacent to the center section

 

*Cell atmosphére gas, consisting of about 95% nitrogen and
5% oxygen. '
 

 

 

will melt a frozen plug in 10 to 25 min, depending on
the particular application. Initially this heat was pro-
vided by an electrical resistance-type heater attached to
the center section, but operating experience proved that
it is unnecessary.

There are 12 freeze valves in the MSRE, all of which
provide “‘on-off” control action. The details of their
design, construction, and operating characteristics are

described in ORNL-TM-728, Part 1.! The general

arrangements at the valves are shown in ORNL-TM-728,
Part I, Figs. 5.31, 5.32, 5.33, and 5.34.!

The control circuit diagrams for all 12 valves are
shown in Figs. 4.1.46 to 4.1.51 inclusive. Although the
basic circuit design and operating characteristics are the
same for all circuits, individual differences make it
convenient to divide them into four major groups.
These are:

Group 1 FV103
Group 11 FV104, FV105, and FV106
Group I FV107 through FV112
Group IV FV204 and FV206

Groups I and II control the flow of molten salt
between the reactor vessel and the three drain tanks.
Four of the six group III valves are in lines connecting
the fuel drain tanks to the fuel processing tank; the
remaining two are in lines connected to the fuel
processing tank only Group. IV valves are in the
coolant-salt system. See Fig. 1.4.3, ORNL-TM-729, Part
IIA* -

432 Bas:c Circuit Operatnon

The circuit for group II freeze valve FVlOS Flg
4.1.47, will be used as a typical example to explain the
basic operation which is applicable to all the circuits.
The differences between this circuit and those in the
other groups will be explained at the appropriate time.
This particular valve circuit is used as an example
primarily  because it utilizes every type of interlock
used in all of the circuits. A simplified version, shown in
Fig. 4.3.1c, will be used to explain the basic operating
characteristics of the freeze valve control circuits. The
operator controls the valve with a manually operated
switch, HS-909A, located on the main control board

(see Fig. 4.3.14). The switch has two positions, “freeze”

and “‘thaw.” Once the switch is set to the desired
position, the control circuit functions automatlcally to
prowde the following actions:

1. Thaw the valve on demand. When the valve is frozen
and the switch is turned to the “‘thaw” position, the
cooling air is shut off, allowing the flow of heat

133

from adjacent pipes and the shoulder heaters to
thaw the frozen plug.

2. Freeze the valve on demand. When the valve is
thawed and the switch is turned to the “freeze”
position, the cooling air is turned on at the
maximum flow rate, and the valve begins to cool.
When the temperature at either shoulder falls below
the value at which the salt in the pipe solidifies, the
flow of cooling air is reduced to a rate sufficient to
maintain the plug but not enough to extend its size
beyond the shoulders.

3. Actuate operational interlocks. The circuit energizes
relays to indicate the condition of the valve (frozen
or thawed). Contacts on these relays are used as
permissive interlocks in the master control circuits
(see Sect. 4.2).

4. Indicate the valve’s operational status. The circuit
energizes lamps which are located near the switch on
the main board to provide continuous visual indica-
tion of the valve’s operational status. Additional
information is also provided by the main board
annunciators.

The condition of the valve is determined by meas-
uring the temperatures at the center and on both
shoulders of the valve. Two thermocouples are provided
at each location for this purpose. Thermocouple loca-
tions for all valves are shown on ORNL Dwg.
D-HH-B-40543.2 One thermocouple at each position is
connected to a solid state temperature switch which
consists of two parallel-connected control modules in
an Electro Scientific monitor system (see Sect. 6.15).
This is illustrated by Fig. 4.3.15. The switches operate,
together with the manual switch HS-909A in the circuit
shown in Fig. 4.3.1¢, to control the cooling air supply
valves, position indicator lamps, operational interlocks,
and annunciators.

The operating set points of the temperature switches
differ from one valve to another. Actual settings were
determined in the field by trial and error and are
recorded in the MSRE Process. Instrument Switch
Tabulation. In actual practice, a valve is thawed when’
the temperature of the salt is slightly above 850°F and

_ is frozen when the temperature is slightly below 850°F.

For the purpose of this explanation, the switches are set
to operate at the nominal temperature values given in
Table 4.3.1.

The control circuit shown in Fig. 4.3.1¢ operates as
follows: Assume that the valve is thawed and manual
switch HS-909A is turned to the “thaw” position

open). When the valve ,. is fully thawed,—r the center

temperature is above 1000°F and the shoulder temper-
atures are above 800°F. Under these conditions, switch
contact TS-FV105-2A1 is closed and control auxiliary
relay K672 is energized,; switch contacts TS-FV105-1A1
and 3A1 are open and relay K673 is deenergized. Relay
contacts K672C, K672E, K673A, K673C, and K682A
are closed and contacts K672D, K673B, and K673D are
open. The solenoid valves HCV-909A2 and A3 are
deenergized and the cooling air is shut off; the red lamp
is on steady, the green lamp is off, and the annunciator
on the main board (circuit 904) is off. The circuit in
Fig. 4.1.3c is shown as described. The valve is in
operational mode 1. Valve conditions for each opera-
tional mode are listed in Table 4.3.2. Table 4.3.3 shows
the position of each contact (open or closed) for each
of the six operating modes.
If the manual switch is now turned to the “freeze”

position, ‘contact HS-909A-2 opens and HS-909A-1
closes; solenoid valves HCV-909A-2 and HCV-909A-3

‘energize jmmediately, and cooling air is applied to the

center of the valve at the maximum rate; circuit 680 is
energized through the normally closed contact K673C,

- and. the green lamp turns on flashing® to indicate that

the valve, though still thawed, is in the process of
freezing; operational interlock relay K682 deenergizes,

" and contact K682A opens in annunciator circuit 904 to

produce an audible and visual alarm. The valve is now in
operational mode 2.

‘The valve is now being cooled, and when the center
temperature  falls  below  1000°F,  contact
TS-FV105-2A1 opens, relay K672 deenergizes, and
contact K672C opens to turn off the red lamp. This
indicates that the valve can no longer be considered
thawed, but the green lamp is still flashing, which
indicates that the valve has not yet reached the frozen
condition. The valve is now in operational mode 3.

As the valve continues to cool, the shoulder tempera-
tures fall below 750°F to open contacts TS-FV105-1A1
and 3AlI; relay K673 energizes, contacts K673A and
K673C open, contacts K673B and K673D close; sole-
noid valve HCV-909-A3 deenergizes, the green lamp is
turned on steady, operational interlock relay K681 is
energized, and contact K681A closes to clear the
annunciator. The valve is now in operation mode 4; all

_of the required conditions are satisfied, and the valve is

frozen.

If the manual switch is now turned to the “thaw”
position, contact HS-909A-1 opens and HS-909A-2
closes. This starts a sequence of control actions which
cause the valve to thaw. Solenoid valves HCV-909A-2
and HCV-909A-3 deenergize immediately to shut off
the flow of cooling air; operational interlock relay
K681 also deenergizes immediately and opens contact
K681A in annunciator circuit 904 to produce an
audible and visual alarm. Since circuit 679 is energized
through the normally closed contact K672D, the red
lamp turns on flashing to indicate that the valve, though
still frozen, is in the process of thawing. The valve is
now in operational mode 5.

The valve is now heating and when the temperature at
either shoulder rises above 800°F, switch contacts
TS-FV105-1A1 and 3A1 open, relay K673 deenergizes,

- contacts K673A and K673C close, contacts K673B and

K673D open, the green lamp goes out and the valve can
no longer be considered frozen, but the red lamp is still
flashing which indicates that the valve has not yet
reached the frozen condition. The valve is now in
operational mode 6. e

As the valve continues to heat up, the center

‘temperature rises above 1000°F, switch contact TS-

FV105-2A1 closes, relay K672 energizes, relay contacts
K672C and K672E close, contact K672D opens, the red

lamp is on steady, operational interlocks relay K682 is

energized, and contact K682A closes to clear annunci-
ator circuit 904. All of the conditions required for a
thawed valve are satlsﬁed and the circuit is in opera-
tional mode 1. :

‘Two important characteristics should be emphasized
at this point. The .first concerns the operational
 

 

i 101 sttt

 

interlock relays K681 and K682. The purpose of these
relays not only in this circuit but also in all of the other
circuits is to give a positive indication of the valve’s
condition (either thawed or frozen), and contacts on
these relays are used as permissive interlocks in the
master control circuits as described in Sect. 4.2. The
second is the fail-safe configuration of the solenoid
valve circuits. The operation of the contacts in these
circuits is such that, if control circuit power fails or 2
solenoid coil burns out, the valve closes, and the cooling
air supply is shut off, allowing the valve to thaw. This
type of operation is highly desirable for the valves in
groups I, II, and IV because safe conditions exist in the
salt systems when they are open, but it creates a
problem for the valves in group III.

Group III valves are not used very often, and when
not in use they are allowed to go into a special
operating mode known as ““deep freeze” (see opera-
tional mode 4A, Table 4.3.2). Once a valve is frozen, it
is put in the ‘“deep freeze” condition simply by
deenergizing the shoulder heaters and allowing the
temperatures to level off at some value between 400
and 600°F. For safety reasons all group III valves must
remain frozen under all circumstances. The problem
arises when a control circuit power failure occurs and
the cooling air system solenoid valves deenergize,
shutting off the cooling air flow. Without cooling air, it
is possible for the group III valves to thaw. Solenoid
ECV-9002-5 is installed to prevent this by connecting
the pneumatic operator of the cooling air supply valve
to a third air pressure source as shown in Fig. 4.3.15.
For normal operations ESV-9002-5 is energized through
circuit 700, Fig. 4.1.47. If a power failure occurs,
ESV-9002-5 deenergizes so that air pressure is applied
to hold all of the group III cooling air supply valves
open.

4.3.3 Valve Condition, Master Control, and
Safety Interlocks

The explanation of the freeze valve control circuit
operating characteristics thus far is based on idealized
conditions; that is, it assumes that operating tempera-
tures are always the same, as shown in Table 4.3.1, that
the shoulder temperatures never fall below a minimum
value when the valve is frozen (this is important because
the time required to thaw a valve is determined by the
shoulder temperatures), and that the siphon pots are
always thawed. In actual practice, operating tempera-
tures as well as switch set points drift. This can cause
spurious operations of the interlock relays. Also,
shoulder temperatures may fall below the values re-

136

quired for acceptable thawing times, and freeze pots

may not remain thawed. Such occurrences are pre-

vented or at least minimized by the use of additional
valve condition interlock circuits. These are;

1. Shoulder temperature limit — A674 and B674.
2. Shoulder temperature control — C674 and D674.
3. Siphon break temperature limits — A675 and B675.

The circuit numbers refer to FV105 in Figure 4.1.47,
which is used as an example, but their operation is
typical for other valves where they are used. All of the
circuits listed impose restrictions on the operation of
the cooling air control solenoids in circuit 677. Item 2
circuits also control the operational interlock relays in

circuit 681. Still further restrictions are imposed on the

operation of the cooling air solenoids by safety system
interlocks and by the master control circuit interlocks.
The latter operate on the valve circuits through the
interlocks in the permissive-to-thaw relay circuit A676,
which is described in the following paragraph.

For this explanation, circuit 677 has been rearranged
and is shown in Fig. 4.3.2. The manual switch contact
HS-909-A1 is closed, contacts KA675C and KB675C
are closed, and contacts KA675D and KB675D are
open. If the master control circuits have given per-
mission to thaw FV10S, relay KA676 is energized,
contact KA676D is open, and contact KA676C is
closed. Under these conditions the cooling air solenoids
are energized through the series-connected contacts
HS-909-A1, KA675C, KB675C, and KA676C. It should
be apparent that if the siphon break temperature falls
below 900°F or if permission to thaw the valve is not
granted, then the above relay contacts will reverse their
aspects, and one or more of the three parallel-connected
contacts will close and bypass the manual switch
contact HS-909A1. This keeps the cooling air solenoids
energized and prevents the valve from being thawed by
manual request. Thawing a valve with a frozen siphon
pot is not desirable because the resulting expansion of
salt trapped between the valve and the siphon pot could
rupture the line. The occurrence of a low temperature
condition in the siphon breaks also actuates circuit 904
to produce an audible and visual alarm. All of the valves
are equipped with siphon break pots except FV103,
and all except FV103, FV204, and FV206 have
permissive-to-thaw interlock circuits. Thawing restric-
tions are not permitted on FV103 for safety reasons,
and they are not needed on the latter two valves.

The circuits listed under items 1 and 2 above control
the valve in the “freeze” mode. The basic operation is

- the same as described for modes 3 and 4, Table 4.3.2,
 

 

 

 

but the circuits are more complex because of the need

137

to positively prevent freeze valve temperature drifts or

switch set-point drifts from producing spurious and
false operations of the “frozen” interlock relay (circuit
681). Such operations are intolerable because they
deenergize the master control circuits to cause unneces-
sary shutdowns. When the valve is thawed, these
temperature drifts are not a problem, because the valve
temperatures are well above the switch set points, but
when the valves in groups 1, II, and IV are frozen, they
must always be maintained ready to thaw. This requires
that their temperatures be maintained at values close to
the thaw point and this does not leave much room for
drifts. Group IV valve temperatures do not have to be
controlled so closely, and the type of circuit described
in the section on basic operations is adequate. In the
group IV valve circuits, the shoulder temperature limit
relays {circuits A696 and B696, Fig. 4.1.48, aré typical)
are used only to activate an annunciator if the
temperatures fall too low.

The main difference between the shoulder tempera-
ture control circuits in Fig. 4.1.47 and those previously
described is a physical one, namely, the two shoulder
temperature switches TS-FV105-1A1 and 3A1 have
been moved from circuit K673 to individual relay
circuits C674 and D674. Either one of these circuits
will respond to shoulder temperature changes and
operate relay K673, which, in turn, operates the
indicator lamps and the *“blast-hold” air solenoid.
Additional contacts on these same two relays (KC674
and KD674) combine with center temperature switch
contact TS-FV105-2A2 to form a two-of-three logic
matrix in relay circuit 681. Relay K681, which ener-
gizes to denote a frozen valve, will remain continuously
energized as long as the center temperature and one
shoulder temperature are below the upper limit (550,
900, and 930°F respectively in this particular case) or
both shoulder temperatures are below the upper limit.
This contact arrangement, coupled with careful adjust-
ment of the shoulder heaters, practically eliminates
false interlock operations as a result of drifting tempera—
ture signals and switch actuation point..

relays KA674 and KB674 remain energized, contacts
KA674 and KB674B remain closed, solenoid valve
HSV-909-A2 remains energized, and cooling air is
applied to the freeze valve. Contacts KC674D and
KD674D are shunted and have no effect on circuit 677.
This makes it possible for circuits C674 and D674 to
provide automatic on-off control for the “blast-hold”
solenoid HCV-909-A3. If, however, either one of the
shoulder temperature control relays (KC674 and
KD674) is energized (temperature less than 850°F) at
the same time that either one of the shoulder tempera-
ture limit relays is deenergized, then circuit 677 will
open, ‘and the cooling air supply solenoid will deener-
gize and shut off the flow of cooling air to the freeze
valve. Freeze valves FV103, FV204, and FV206 have
redundant cooling air supply solenoids, but the opera-
tion of contacts in their circuits is the same as for the
others.

Contact KB18A in circuit 677 is a safety-grade
interlock which opens to shut off cooling air if any.
emergency fuel drain is demanded. Circuits for freeze
valves FV103, FV106, FV204, and FV206 are also
energized through safety-grade interlocks. The actions

of these contacts override the actions of all others to

thaw the valves when an emergency drain is 'called for.

4.4 RADIATOR LOAD CONTROL SYSTEM

- The load control system, includin_g the circuits shown -
in Figs. 4.1.1, 4.1.13, 4.1.14, 4.1.20, 4.1.40, and
4.1.51, is thoroughly described in Sect. 2.8, but a few

‘details about the design and operation of individual

circuits are omitted there and are worth mentioning

"here.

One of these is the AP, drxve motor in circuit 152.
The differential pressure (AP) across the radiator is the
controlled variable in this system. The AP controller
 

 

set-point signal (APgp) is supplied by an instrument air
pressure regulating valve (Fig. 2.8.6). This valve is not
operated manually but is driven by a small single-phase
ac motor and gear reducer.! The motor rotates in a
forward direction to increase the APgp pressure signal
when relay K153 is energized and in the reverse
direction to decrease APgp pressure when K151 is

energized. Only one relay at a time can be energized,

“and two limit switches, ZS, coupled to the drive shaft
prevent valve stem overtravel.

Another detail is the operation of the automatic start
feature and the discharge dampers on main. blowers
MB1 and MB3 in circuits 155 through 160. Circuits 155
and 158 operate circuit breakers P and Q in the same
way as described in Sect. 4.2.2 for the fuel-salt pump.
Automatic load . control is established when the op-
erator energizes relay K150. If system conditions are
not preventive, one of the main blowers is started
manually, and then load demand switch S24 is ma-
nipulated to cause an automatically programmed in-
crease or decrease in the load on the reactor system.
Either blower, MB1 or MB3, may be started manually,
and the other blower can then be set up by circuits 156
and 157 to start or stop automatically as required by
the load programming system. When switch S29A is
closed to start MBI, contact S29B opens to deenergize
circuit 156, and contact S29C closes to energize circuit
157. Relay K157 remains energized through seal con-
tact K157A after push-button switch S29 is released.
With MBI running, contacts K166C and KA150H in
MB3 control circuit 158 are both open, and contact
K166D is closed. The only way to energize relay
KA158 to start MB3 is through contact K154C.
Contact K154C will close when the automatic load
program energizes relay K154. To reduce the load, the
operator turns switch S24 to the “decrease’ position,
and the bypass damper opens. When the full open
position is reached, contact K214D opens, and if switch
S24 is still in the *“decrease” position, all of the
permissive-to-run contacts in the parallel group with
S24E are open. Relay KB158 is deenergized and MB3
stops. When both blowers are on, the selection of the
“automatic” blower may be changed by pushing the
“on” button of the desired blower.

Circuits 159 and 160 energize solenoid valves which
supply air to drive the pneumatic operators on the main
blower discharge dampers. The pneumatic system,
including the damper operators and position switches, is
shown on drawing D-HH-Z-55529.2 When both blowers
are off, the solenoid valves are deenergized and the
dampers are open. This is a fail-safe circuit arrangement
to protect the blowers, which can be damaged if

138

i

operated while the dampers are closed. The piston-type
operators are supplied from the emergency air system.
The 60-psig actuating pressure works against a 30-psig
cushion. If the solenoid fails, this cushion of air will
return the damper to the open position. For normal
operation of the blowers, the solenoids are energized
through auxiliary contacts on the power circuit
breakers. These contacts are so arranged that when only
one blower is running, the damper on the second
blower is closed to prevent the loss of air flow through
the blower opening. The damper on the second blower
opens when that blower is started and the solenoid
valve deenergizes. :

Manual switches S128 and S129, located on main
board 10, are used to close the dampers when the
blowers are off. This is sometimes desirable for main-
tenance purposes when the reactor is shut down. When
these - switches are in position to close the dampers,
additional contacts in circuits 155 and 158 open to
prevent operation of the main blowers.

Circuits 166 and 167 provide additional contacts for
use in other circuits where circuit breaker position
interlocks are required.

4.6 FISSION CHAMBER DRIVES

The MSRE is equipped with two identical wide-range
counting systems which measure the neutron flux near
the reactor core vessel. The neutron sensors are fission
chambers mounted on positioning devices as illustrated
 

 

by Fig. 2.3.1, Part I1A. A dc servomotor drives each
device to move the chamber toward or away from the
reactor vessel. The operator controls each motor in-
dividually by manipulating one of two switches, S13
and S14, mounted on the operator’s console (MB13) in
the main control room as shown in Fig. 4.7.2.1. A
dial-type indicator and several lamps mounted on the
main .console panel just above each switch provide

information about the positions of the chambers and

the operating status of the positioning devices.

In each system all of the operator-initiated control
functions are incorporated in a single switch; control
mode selection requires a lateral push or pull motion on
the operating handle, while manual directional com-
mands require rotary motions. The two lateral positions
correspond to the available control modes — manual
and automatic. The automatic mode is established when
the switch handle is pushed in, manual mode when
pulled out. The handle also has three rotary positions —
insert, auto-manual, and withdraw. It is spring-loaded to
return to the center (auto-manual) position when

‘released. A mechanical lock prevents rotary motions
{manual directional commands) when the switch handle
is pushed in (automatic mode).

The drive motors on the two positioners are con-
trolled by identical circuits as shown in Fig. 4.1.17. The
motor for fission chamber 1 is energized through the
S13 switch contacts in circuits 189 and 190, and the
one for chamber 2 is energized through the S14 switch
contacts in circuits 191 and 192. The circuits are
entirely separate from one another, and each is ener-
gized by an independent 32-V dc power supply. The
indicator lamps on the console are energnzed through
circuits 496 and 497, Fig. 4.1.39.

To illustrate the operation of both circuits, consider
fission chamber drive 1. First, assume that switch S13 is

139

Now, to illustrate further, assume that switch S13 is
in the center rotary position (auto-manual) and the

‘handle is pulled out (manual control is established). In

in the center rotary position (auto-manual) and the-

handle is pushed in (automatic control mode is estab-
lished). In this position, switch contacts S13A and
S13B are closed and all other $13 contacts in the motor
circuit are open. This contact configuration connects
the servomotor directly ta the output signal terminals
of the servo amplifier. The servomotor operates auto-
matlcally in response to the amplifier signals and
maintains the fission chamber at the correct position.
Switch contact S13G also closes in circuit 496 to
energize the green (automatic) indicator lamp,
XI-NCC1-A2, on the console. The design and operating
characteristics of the servo amplifier and other compo-
nents in the measuring system are described in Sect.
2.3, Part IIA.

this position, switch contacts S13A and S13B open to
disconnect the motor from the servo amplifier, and
contact S13C closes in circuit 496 to energize the red
(manual) indicator lamp, XI-NCC1-A2, on the console.
Contacts S13E and S13F also close at the same time,
but the motor remains deenergized because contacts
S13J, S13K, S13L, and S13M are all open. Rotating
switch S13 to the “insert” position closes contacts S13J
and S13M. The servomotor is energized by the flow of
current from the positive bus through switch contacts
S13J and S13E, relay contact K242A, motor armature
M, relay contact K243A, and switch contacts S13F and
S13M to the negative bus. The motor drives the
positioner to move the fission chamber toward the
reactor vessel. Contacts K242A and K243A remain
closed as long as the positioner is within the prescribed
limits of travel. In this case if the positioner moves
beyond the insertion limit, switch ZS-NCC1-A2 opens
circuit 243 (Fig. 4.1.19), relay K243 deenergizes, and
contact K243A opens. The diode blocks the flow of
current, and the motor stops. At the same time, contact
K243C closes in circuit 496 (Fig. 4.1.39) and energizes
green lamp ZI-NCC1-A2 on the console to call this
condition to the operator’s attention.

Rotating switch S13 to the “withdraw™ position
closes contacts S13L and S13K. The flow of current
through armature M is reversed, and the motor drives
the positioner to move the chamber away from the
reactor vessel. Travel is limited by switch ZS-NCC1-Al,
which opens to deenergize relay K242 and open contact
K242A. Contact K242C also closes in circuit 496 to
energize red indicator lamp ZI-NCC1-A1 on the console
if the positioner drives beyond the withdrawal travel
limit.

4.7 SAFETY CIRCUITS - -

The ‘major components of the fuel- and coolant-salt
systems, such as reactor vessel, pumps, heat exchanger,
radiator, and interconnecting pipes, are not only ex-
pensive, difficult-to-replace items that are vital to the
performance of the reactor experiment, but also form
the primary containment barrier to the contents of the
salt systems. The safety instrumentation and control
systems function to prevent both the continuation of

- operations under conditions which could damage these

components and the escape of hazardous materials to
 

 

 

 

surrounding areas if for any reason some malfunction
occurs. A broad, overall description of these safety
systems and the basic principles which guided their
design is presented in Sect. 1.5.

In general, each safety system is composed of three
major subsystems: measurements, electrical circuits, and
final control elements. The measuring systems are
assemblies of highly reliable, safety-grade components
which continuously monitor reactor conditions. If any
of these conditions exceed established limits, instru-
ment switch contacts, operating in safety-grade circuits,
actuate final control elements to either shut the reactor
down or seal openings into the primary and secondary
enclosures or both if required by existing conditions.
The flow of information through these subsystems,
from measuring elements to final control elements, is
described by the input-output diagram of Fig. 1.5.2 and
Table 1.5.1. The remainder of this section is a de-
scription of the safety-grade circuits that are controlled
by inputs I through IX and operate to protect the
integrity of the system by shutting the reactor down.
The containment circuits which operate to block all
openings into the reactor system are controlled by
inputs X through XVII and will be discussed in Sect.
48.

4.7.1 Load Scram Circuits

The safety-grade circuits that shut the reactor down
by dropping (scramming) the load, dropping the control
rods, and draining the reactor vessel are shown in Figs.
4.1.1, 4.1.2, and 4.1.10. The load scram circuits,
numbers 4 through 16, 124, and 125, are illustrated by
Figs. 2.8.13 and 2.8.14, and their operation is thor-
oughly described in Sect. 2.8.6.

4.7.2 Fuel Drain Demand Circuits

The certain method for obtaining absolute shutdown
and returning the system to the safest possible con-
dition is to drain the contents of the reactor vessel into
the drain tanks. An input-output diagram of the reactor
drain instrumentation and control system is shown in
Fig. 1.5.3. Circuits 1, 2, and 3 in Fig. 4.1.1 and circuits
18 through 27 in Fig. 4.1.2 are a vital part of this
system. Logic diagrams for these circuits are shown in
Figs. 4.1.65 and 4.1.68.

A drain is produced when either one or both of
circuits 18 and 19 deenergize and open contacts in the
circuits listed in Table 4.7.2.1. These operate control
elements in the fill and drain system, which is described
in Sects. 1.5.1 and 4.2.4. A drain is also produced if
either one or both of circuits 20 and 21 deenergize but

140

only during fill operations when special restrictions are
in force. Once freeze valve FV103 is frozen, circuits 20
and 21 cannot produce a drain.

A fuel system emergency drain may be initiated
manually or automatically. The operator can deenergize
circuits 18 and 19 by turning manual switch S3, located
on the main console as shown in Fig. 4.7.2.1, to the
“drain” position. The conditions which automatically
initiate a drain are: high reactor outlet temperature,
high level in the fuel pump overflow tank, high
radioactivity in the coolant pump off-gas or the reactor
cell, and high pressure (>>25 psig) in the fuel pump
bowl. Other conditions which initiate a drain during a
fill operation only are: high pressure (2 psig) in the
fuel pump bowl and control rod position below the fill
level.

Three independent temperature measuring systems
(see Fig. 2.54 and Sect. 2.5.1) operate switches
TSS100A1-1, TSS100A2-1, and TSS100A3-3, which
open to deenergize circuits 1, 2, and 3 if -the reactor
outlet temperature gets too high. Contacts on these
relays are connected as shown in Fig. 4.7.2.2 to form a
two-of-three coincident matrix in each of redundant
circuits 18 and 19. The contacts will open and
deenergize both circuits if any two of the three reactor
outlet temperature switches open.

Input circuits 22-23, 24-25, and 26-27 are redundant
pairs which deenergize if pump bowl pressure, reactor
cell activity, and coolant off-gas activity measurements
exceed the established limits. Contacts on relays K22,
K24, and K26 are series connected in circuit 18 to form
one of two independent input-output safety channels;
those on relays K23, K25, and K27 are series connected
in circuit 19 to form the other channel. The operation
of any one of the two circuits in all three input pairs
will deenergize either circuit 18 or circuit 19 and
produce a fuel drain. They also shut off the fuel salt
pumps (circuit 147 in Sect. 4.2.2) and close several
containment block valves (Sects. 4.8.1 and 4.8.5).

Level switches LSS600B and LSS599B, operated by
two independent measuring systems (see Sect. 3.2) and
connected directly in circuits 18 and 19, initiate the
corrective action if the fuel pump overflow tank is more
than 20% full of salt.

Circuits 20 and 21 are interlocked with 18 and 19 so
that all four must be energized to permit reactor filling
operations. When these operations are in progress,
safety considerations require that positive pressures in
the fuel pump bowl be limited to +2 psig or less and
that all three control rods be withdrawn to the fill
position. If, at any time during a fill,” the above
requirements are not met, the pressure and position

switches shown in Fig. 4.7.2.2 open and deenergize
circuits 20 and 21. The drain tank helium supply valves
close, the bypass valves open, and since freeze valve
FV103 is already thawed, the filling process is reversed
and the reactor begins to drain. When conditions return
to normal, the switches close automatically to stop the
drain, and the fill operation may continue.

Circuits 22 and 23 energize automatically when the
pressure switches close, but circuits 24, 25, 26, and 27
must be energized manually; for example, when switch
RSS-565B1 opens, even momentarily, circuit 24 in Fig.
4.7.2.2 automatically deenergizes and will not energize
again unless RSS-565B1 and push-button switch S96
are both closed. The circuit remains energized through
seal contact K24F when the push bottom is released.
The designs of all four radiation circuits are identical.
The indicator lamps, push buttons, and the radiation
switches are all located together on nuclear board NB4
in the auxiliary control room.

4.7.3 Nuclear Circuits

Although the nuclear safety systern is discussed at
length in Sect. 2.5, it interconnects with the process
safety system at several points, and these deserve a brief
explanation. Besides initiating a drain, the reactor
outlet temperature circuits described in the previous
section also scram the control rods by opening relay
contacts K1A, K2A, and K3A in the three branches of
circuit 28. This deenergizes three independent sets of
relays mounted in ORNL model Q-2623 nuclear instru-
ment chassis RX-NSC1-A6, RX-NSC2-A6, and RX-
NSC3-A6. The contacts of relays in the chassis are
interconnected to form three two-out-of-three coinci-
dence matrices in circuit 29. One rod drive clutch is
energized through each matrix as shown in Fig. 2.5.5
and will deenergize to drop the rods when any two of
the three branches of circuit 28 are opened. Other
instrument signals shown in Fig. 2.5.1 will deenergize
circuit 28 and drop the control rods, but these are a
part of the nuclear safety system described in Sect. 2.5.

Circuit 28, when deenergized, also initiates a load
scram and a control rod reverse. Nuclear instrument
switches RSS-NSC1-A4, RSS-NSC2-A4, and RSS-
NSC3-A4 in circuit 124 (Fig. 4.1.10) and RSS-
NSC1-A4, RSS-NSC2-A4, and RSS-NSC3-A4 in circuits
248, 249, and 250 (Fig. 4.1.19) are actually relay
contacts in the three Q-2623 nuclear instrument chassis.

142

safety grade but are redundant control channels with a
two-out-of-three coincident logic contact arrangement
in circuit 186 (Fig. 4.1.16). Circuit 186 produces a rod
reverse when energized. In addition to initiating the rod
reverse when deenergized, relays 248, 249, and 250 also
close contacts in the three branches of circuit 498 to

~energize lamps XI-NSC1-A, XI-NSC2-A, and XI-NSC3-A

(Fig. 4.1.39) and open contacts in circuit 1085 (Fig.
4.1.58) to sound an alarm in the main control room.
The lamps in circuit 498 are located on the operator’s
console as shown in Fig. 4.7.2.1. The lamps energized
through relay circuits 248, 249, and 250 also indicate a
rod reverse but are mounted in the Q-2623 relay chassis
on NB2. .

The control rod. clutch coils in circuit 29 also
deenergize to drop the rods when switch S1 (Fig.
4,7.2.1) is turned to the scram position. K29 is a
quick-opening relay used for rod drop tests only. When
switch S1 is opened, K29 and the control rod clutch
circuits are deenergized simultaneously. Contact K29A
closes in circuit 196, Fig. 4.1.18, and engages the clutch
to start the rod drop timer as the rods start to fall. The
timer is shut off when the falling rods actuate the lower
limit switches and deenergize relays K230, K231, K234,
K235, K238, and K239 in Fig. 4.1.19.

The flux level scram trip point circuits in Fig. 4.1.30
are described in Fig. 2.5.2, Fig. 2.5.3, and Sect. 2.5.1.

4.8 CONTAINMENT

The MSRE containment system design criteria are
discussed at length in Sect. 1.2.3.1. In general the
containment requirements are met by providing two
independent barriers, in series, between the interior of
the primary system, which contains fuel salt, and the
surrounding atmosphere. The fuel system pipe and
vessel walls form the primary barrier. The fuel system is
enclosed in the reactor and drain tank cells, which form
the secondary containment barrier. A third barrier,
controlled ventilation, is also provided for all areas that
surround the secondary containment area (see Sect. 13,
Part I). The instrumentation for the containment
ventilation system is described in Sect. 3.11. Service

‘pipes and instrument signal lines to and from the in-cell

Circuits 124 and 125, also shown in Fig. 2.5.6, are -

redundant safety channels with two-out-of-three coinci-
dent logic, which produce a load scram (see Sect. 2.8.6)
when deenergized. Circuits 248, 249, and 250 are not

reactor system penetrate the first two barriers. The
helium cover gas supply and discharge lines and the
off-gas sampler lines pierce both primary and secondary
barriers, while the instrument air supply, reactor cell
evacuation, and cooling water lines pierce only the
secondary barrier. The two-barrier containment concept
is fulfilled for the former by providing: (1) two
 

143

independent controlled block valves, (2) one controlled
block valve plus a restriction such as a charcoal bed, or
(3) one controlled block valve plus two check valves
For the latter, the concept is fulfilled by prowdlng one
controlled block valve or one check valve in each line to
supplement the primary fixed barrier. A simplified
illustration of the containment systems with typical
penetrations is shown in Fig. 1.1.6, Part I1A.

. This section describes the electrical circuits which
energize the controlled block valves. in lines that
penetrate containment barriers and the components in
the containment ventilation system. The circuits con-

nect . the instrument systems, which measure reactor

conditions, to the safety block valves as shown in Figs.
4.1.3,4.14,4.15,4.1.6,4.1.7,4.1.31, and 4.1.34. The
system of logic. around which they are designed is
diagrammed in Figs. 4.1.67, 4.1.68, and 4.1.69. The
sequence of operations from instrument switch contacts
through contact multiplication relays to the block valve
solenoids is diagrammed in Figs. 4.8.1 and 4.8.2. On the
latter two- figures the valves are divided into two
categories according to their blocking functions. The
first category is composed of valves in lines that
penetrate both primary and secondary containment
enclosures. They are energized through input signal
contact groups XIV, XV, XI, and VI as shown in Fig.
4.8.1. The second category is composed of valves in
lines that penetrate the secondary containment enclo-
sure only. These are energized through signal contact
group’ XV1 in Fig. 4.8.1 and groups XVII, IX, and XII
in Fig. 4.8.2. Input signal contact groups X in Fig. 4.8.1
and XIII in Fig. 4.8.2 energize valves in both categories.
The ihput signal groups listed here are the same as those
shown in the input-output dlagrams of Fig. 1.5.2 and
Table 1.5.1.

Input signal groups XI, X, XVII, XII, and XIII consist
of three independent and redundant circuits, and the
switch in each circuit is operated by a measuring system
that is independent of the other two. Groups XIV, XV,
VI, XVI, and 1X are composed of redundant pairs. If
deenergized, groups XV, VI, X, XVII, XII, and XIII

reset automatically when -the signal systems close the

‘switches. Groups XIV, XI, XVI, and IX must be reset
manually by momentarily closing a push-button switch.
Group XI, circuits 60, 61 and 62 in Fig. 4.1.5, is a good

example of three independent circuits with the manual

reset “feature. Contacts on the relays in these three
circuits form two-of-three matrices which are connected
directly in block valve circuits 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, and
68. In this case, contact multiplication relay circuits are
not used. Group XIiI, circuits 30, 31 and 32, Fig. 4.8.3,
is a'good example of three independent circuits without

the reset feature. Contacts on relays K30, K31, and
K32 form two-of-three matrices in redundant relay
circuits 36 and 37 which serve to multiply the number
of contacts available for use in valve circuits. Circuits
22-23 and 24-25 in Fig. 4.7.2.2 of the previous section
are examples of input groups composed of redundant
circuit pairs. .

Each input signal causes a speaﬁc group of valves to
close so that containment is maintained when an
out-of-limits condition exists in the reactor system.
Although some of the block valves may be operated,
under normal conditions, through control-grade inter-
locks or manual switch contacts, most of the circuits
are energized continuously, and the valves remain open
unless the safety circuits are actuated, in which case the
circuits deenergize and the valves close. They cannot be
energized again unless operating conditions in the
system return to normal. |

4.8.1 Helium Supply Block Valves

The lines shown in Fig. 1.5.6 connect the fuel- and
coolant-salt system components to line 500, which is
the helium cover gas main supply header. Each line has
at least one and some have two controlled safety block
valves. As illustrated by the diagrams in Fig. 4.8.1, the
control circuits operate automatically to close the
valves if (1) the pressure in line 500 drops below 28 psig
(input signal group X), (2) the radioactivity in line 588
becomes excessive (input signal group XI), or (3) the
fuel drain demand circuits, 20 and 21 deenerglze (input
signal group VI).

The operation of input group VI is not a containment
blocking signal but a fuel drain demand signal, which is
described in Sect. 4.7.2. It is shown here to clarify the

‘operation of the circuits controlling the fuel drain tank

supply valves which are used for both operational and
safety blocking purposes. '

A two-out-of-three configuration is formed i in circuits
40 and 41 by circuits 46, 47, and 48. When the pressure
in line 500 falls below 28 psig, circuits 40 and 41 are

~ deenergized by the operation of any.two of the three

pressure switches in circuits 46, 47, and 48. Contacts on
relays K40 and K41 form one-out-of-two contact
matrices which open to deenergtze the following valve
circuits: .

1. Circuits 63, 64, 65, 66, 67 and 68 (see Flg 4.1.5)
close the block valves in the lines supplying helium
to the fuel pump and overﬂow tank bubbler level
elements.
 

 

 

 

2. Circuits 115, 116, and 127 (see Fig. 4.2.4.2) close
valves in the fuel drain tank helium supply lines.
Since PCV-517A1 combines in the fuel system
supply with HCV-572A1, HCV-574A1, and
HCV-576A1 to form redundant pairs, the safety
interlock contacts and wiring in matrix VI of circuit
127 and those in the same matrix of circuits 115 and
116 are installed in separate conduits.

3. Circuits 42, 43, and 129 (Figs. 4.1.4 and 4.1.9) close
redundant valves ESV-516A1, ESV-516A2, and
FCV-516B1 in the fuel pump helium purge supply
line 516. Only two of the three valves shown in line
516 are needed to meet containment requirements.
The third valve is the result of a last-minute piping
design change and was not removed.

4. Circuit 83 (Fig. 4.1.6) closes redundant valves
ESV-519A and ESV-519B in line 519, which carries
helium purge gas to the reactor vessel drain line 103
and to the fuel drain tank helium supply lines 572,
574, and 576.

5. Circuits 126 and 128 (see Fig. 4.1.9) close valves
HCV-511A1 in the coolant drain tank helium supply
line 511 and FCV-512A1 in the coolant pump purge
supply line. Only one controlled block valve is used
in line 512 because the heat exchanger tube wall

144

between the fuel- and coolant-salt systems is the first -

safety barrier.

6. Circuits 44 and 45 (Fig. 4.1.4) close valves
PCV-513A1 and PCV-510A1 to block the lines
supplying helium cover gas to the fuel and coolant
system lube oil tanks. These valves are a part of the
pressure control system shown in Fig. 1.5.9.

7. Circuits 75, 76, and 77 (see Fig. 4.1.6) close valves
in the lines supplying helium to the coolant salt
pump bubbler level elements. The manual switch
contacts and the equalizing valves in these circuits as
well as those in item 1 above are not parts of the
safety-grade system but are used during normal
operations for testing purposes. Their functions are
described in Sect. 4.9.8. |

The circuits in items 1 through 4 control valves in
lines that penetrate both primary and secondary con-
tainment barriers. Those in items 5 through 7 control
valves in lines that penetrate the secondary barrier only.
The fuel pump lube oil system helium supply valve
PCV-513A1 in item 6 has a secondary containment
status because the fuel pump shaft seal is considered to
be the first or primary containment barrier. The vent
valve PCV-513A2, which is discussed in the following

section, is also considered to be a secondary barrier for
the same reason. '

Relay contacts K46F, K47F, and K48F open in
annunciator circuit 964 (Fig. 4.1.54) to activate an
alarm in the auxiliary control room which warns the
operator that the helium supply system block valves are
closed. Pressure switches PS-500B1 and B2 on line 500
also provide low- and high-pressure alarms by opening
annunciator circuits 966 and 967 to warn the operator
that the block valves are about to close.

Line 588 is a vent for the drain tank pressure
transmitters’ zero reference pressure system (see Sect.
6.2). When input signal group XI indicates that an

excessive level of radioactivity exists in line 588,

switches RSS-596A, B, and C open to deenergize relays
K60, K61, and K62 and initiate blocking actions in the
helium lines supplying the level elements (bubblers) and
pressure measuring instruments connected to the fuel
pump bowl, the overflow tank, and the fuel drain tanks.
Contacts on the relays are connected to form two-out-
of-three coincident matrices in those circuits listed in
items 1 and 2 above. If any two relays deenergize, the
contact matrices open and the block valves close.

4.8.2 Off-Gas System Block Valves

Line 557, Fig. 1.5.8, carries helium off-gas from the
main and auxiliary charcoal beds, the coolant-salt
pump, the coolant-salt drain tanks, and the lube-oil
systems to the containment air stack, where it is
discharged into the atmosphere. The radioactivity of
the gas in the line is monitored by elements RM-557A
and B. It is evident from Figs. 4.8.1 and 4.1.6 that an
excess radioactivity signal from either element (input
signal group XVI) deenergizes circuits 70, 71, 72, 73,
and 74 to close block valves HCV-557C1, PCV-513A2,
and PCV-510A2. All three valves are secondary con-
tainment barriers only. High radioactivity causes
switches RSS-557A1 and Bl to open and deenergize
redundant relays K70 and K71. The relay contacts are
connected in a one-out-of-two configuration in the
valve circuits and open to deenergize all three valves if
either one of the relays operates. _

The off-gas sampler is located in the vent house and is
connected to line 522 upstream from the charcoal beds
as shown in Figs. 1.5.8 and 1.5.10. Since the sample
lines are extensions of the primary containment barrier,
two safety-grade block valves (see Sect. 6.20) are
connected in series to form redundant pairs in both the
supply and return lines. Each valve in a series pair is
energized gby separate branches of circuit 319, Fig.
4.1.34. If either branch deenergizes, two valves close to
 

 

 

 

145

block both supply and return lines. Indicator lamps
I-319A and I-319B on OGS control panel 1 are lit when
voltage is applied to energize the valve solenoids.

Each branch of circuit 319 is controlled by a separate’

relay in the OGS block demand circuit 318. Neither
circuit can be energized until the operator in the main
control room gives permission by closing manual switch
S161A. If S161A is closed and push-button switch
S162A is closed momentarily, relay KA318 will en-
ergize and remain energized as long as the following
conditions prevail:

1. Fuel pump pressure is less than 10 psig (input signal
group XV) — safety relay contact KA379F is closed.

2. Reactor cell pressure is less than 2 psig (input signal

group XIII) — safety relay contact K36G is closed.

3. Radioactivity in OGS secondary containsnent, en-
closure is not excessive (input signal group XIV) —
safety switch RS-54A2 is closed.

When the push-button switch is released, energizing
current continues to flow to the relay through seal
contact KA318C. As long as relay KA318 is energized,
contact KA318A ‘is closed and manual switch S164B
may be used to open and close valves ESV-537A and
ESV-538A as required to operate the sampler. Relay
KB318 and manual switch S165B operate in identical
circuits to control the other two valves, ESV-537B and
ESV-538A.

4.8.3 Secondary Containment Penetration Block
Valves

- The valves described in this section are shown in Fig.
4.8.2. They are installed in lines which penetrate the
secondary containment enclosure only.

" 48.3.1 Instrument air lines. The block valves in these

lines have pneumatic operators, all connected to a
.common header, which is supplied through the solenoid -

valve matrix as shown in Fig. 1.5.1. Under normal
Operatmg conditions, the three-way solenoid valves are
energized so that the air supply line is open and air
pressure is maintained in the header and the operators
to hold the block valves open. If the atmospheric
pressure in the secondary containment enclosure ex-
ceeds +2 psig, the solenoid valves automatically de-
energize to positions which close the air supply line and
vent the block valve operators to the atmosphere.
Without air pressure in the operators, the spring-loaded
valves close and block the instrument air lines.

The blockmg action is initiated by safety system
input group XIII, which operates circuits 30, 31, 32,
33, 34, and 35 as illustrated in Fig. 4.8.2. The circuits

are shown in Fig. 4.8.3. Pressures greater than +2 psig
open independent switches PSS-RC-B, -F, and -G to
deenergize the relays in circuits 30, 31, and 32. Each
switch deenergizes one relay, which, in turn, de-
energizes one of the three pairs of solenoid valves in
circuits 33, 34, and 35. Each relay and solenoid valve
circuit combination is separate and independent of the
other two. The instrument air line block valves close
when any two of the three solenoid valve circuits
deenergize. The two-out-of-three coincident logic is
provided by the piping arrangement of the solenoid
valve matrix (see Sect. 1.5.1).

4.8.3.2 Waste system. Input signal group XIII, Fig.
4.8.2, also controls the block valves in the liquid waste
system. Liquid waste from the reactor and drain tank
cell pumps is pumped to the liquid waste tank through
lines 333 and 334 (see Fig. 1.5.13). Two series-
connected valves close to block each line if the reactor
cell pressure exceeds +2 psig. When the pressure exceeds
+2 psig, relays K30, K31, and K32 deenergize. The
relay contacts, connected to form two-out-of-three
coincident matrices, open to deenergize redundant relay
circuits 36 and 37. Contacts operated by relays K36
and K37 open to deenergize and close the waste system
valves shown in circuits 38 and 39, Fig. 4.8.3. An
examination of the circuit diagram shows that one valve
in each line is energized through the K36 relay contacts
and the other valves are energized through the K37
relay contacts. The two valves in each line are re-
dundant, and they are controlled by separate and
independent circuits.

Manual switches HS-333 and HS-343, mounted on
TB9 in the transmitter room (TR), are used for routine
transfer and testing operations. The switch contact
development in Fig. 4.1.3 shows the position of each
valve for each position on the switch.

Contacts on relays K36 and K37 also control block
valves serving the off-gas sampler, the fuel drain tank
steam domes, the vapor condensing system, and the
reactor cell oxygen analyzer. The off-gas sampler valves

are discussed in Sect. 4.8.2. Valves serving the other

systems are discussed in the following sections.
4.8.3.3 Vapor condensing tank. The vapor con-
densing system (Sect. 17.3, Part 1) is a secondary
containment enclosure, but it is isolated from the
reactor and drain tank cells b)) rupture disks as shown

~in Fig.. 1.5.8. The vapor condensing tank, VTI, is a

vertical tank about two-thirds full of water, through

~which gases forced from the reactor cell in a major

accident would be bubbled to condense the steam and

_prevent the pressure from rising above 40 psig (see the

Analysis of Hazards, Part V).

146

A bubbler level element, which requires a nitrogen gas
supply, is used periodically to check the water level in
the tank. The nitrogen is supplied to the bubbler dip
tube through safety block valve ESV-VTI-F. This valve
is always energized and remains open unless safety relay
contacts K36H or K37H open to deenergize circuit 49,
Fig. 4.1.4. ,

4.8.3.4 Reactor cell evacuation. During nuclear
operations the pressure in the reactor cell is reduced to
-2 psig (12.7 psia) and held constant at that value by
automatic control (Sect. 3.6). If the pressure falls below
12.2 psia, pressure switch PS-RC-A2 (see circuit 98 in
Fig. 4.1.8) operates to open control-grade contact
K98A in circuit 80, which deenergizes and closes cell

evacuation valve HCV-565-A1 to prevent further evacu-

ation of cell air (see Fig. 1.5.8). At the same time,
contact K98C opens circuit 811, Fig. 4.1.52, to
produce an alarm in the main control room.

If pressure reduction continues until the reactor cell
pressure falls below 10.7 psia, safety input signal group
Xil, Fig. 4.8.2, produces two protective actions: (1)
closes HCV-565-A1, if not already closed, and (2) shuts
off both component coolant pumps. This action is
initiated when pressure switches PSS-RC-H, -J, and -K
in Fig. 4.1.7 open and deenergize relays KA84, KB84,
and KC84. These are identical to the circuits 30, 31,
and 32 previously described. Two-out-of-three contact
matrices operate in circuit 80 to deenergize evacuation
valve HCV-565-A1 and in circuit 85 to shut off the
component coolant pumps (see Fig. 4.9.4.1). A single
contact on each relay also opens circuit 811 to produce

an alarm in the main control room. The indicator lamps

shown in circuit 84 are mounted on the reactor gage
panel (RGP) in the north electric service area (NESA).
Each lamp is lit when its corresponding relay is
energized. They are useful when routine maintenance
and testing operations are performed on the reactor cell
pressure safety system.

HCV-565-A1, along with HCV-915-A1, is also actu-
ated by radioactivity in the reactor and drain tank cell
atmospheres (safety system input group IX). Contacts
K24C and K25C form a one-out-of-two matrix which
opens to deenergize circuit 80 if the radioactivity in the
reactor cell atmosphere becomes excessive. When oper-
ating conditions are normal and all safety interlocks are
closed, manual switch HS-565-A1 may be used to open
and close the cell evacuation valve at the operator’s
convenience. An identical matrix is formed by contacts
K24E and K25E in circuit 82. If either of these
contacts opens, the circuit deenergizes and closes block
valve HCV-915-A1, which supplies component cooling
air to the rod drives and control rod thimbles.

4.8.3.5 Steam dome drain lines. Line 806-2 in Fig.
1.5.7 is used to keep both drain tank steam domes dry
during normal operations. The line penetrates the
secondary containment barrier and has two block valves
connected in series. Valves ESV-806-2A and 806-2B, a
redundant pair, are energized for normal operations
through the one-out-of-two safety contact matrices in
circuit 81 (Fig. 4.8.3). The contacts open and the valves
close if high reactor cell pressure (input group XIII) or
excessive radioactivity (input group IX) is indicated in
the reactor cell evacuation line. The sequence of events
is illustrated in Fig. 4.8.2. Manual switches are provided
on junction box JB153 in the north electric service area
for use during routine operations. This is a compara-
tively remote area, but these valves are used infre-
quently, and the operator has ample time to reach the
switches whenever the steam domes are filled.

4.8.3.6 Reactor cell oxygen analyzer. The oxygen
analyzer is connected to the reactor cell atmosphere
through evacuation line 565 in the vent house. The
safety block valves in the sample supply and return lines
and their control circuits are shown in Figs. 1.5.12 and
4.1.31. Two series-connected valves provide redundant
blocking actions in each line. It is apparent from circuit
298 that one valve in each line is controlled by safety
relays K24 and K36, while the other two valves, one in
each line, are controlled by relays K25 and K37. If
input signal IX indicates excess radioactivity in cell
evacuation line 565 (contacts K24G and K25G open) or
if input signal XIII indicates that reactor cell pressure is

greater than +2 psig (contacts K36D and K37D open), -

circuit 298 is deenergized and the valves close. This
sequence of operations is illustrated in Fig. 4.8.2. The
manual switches and valve position indicator lamps,
located in junction boxes on the vent house wall near
the analyzer, facilitate routine maintenance and opera-
tions, but the circuits are designed so that these
components do not compromise the reliability of the
safety-grade interlocks. |

Since this system penetrates the secondary contain-
ment only, a single valve in each line would have met
the requirements of the two-barrier containment con-
cept, but special considerations make a second valve
desirable. In this case the pressure rating of the analyzer
is less than the 50 psig minimum required for secondary
containment enclosures. ' '

4.8.3.7 Cooling water lines. Treated cooling water
lines to and from the drain tank and reactor cell space
coolers, thermal shield, and fuel pump motor penetrate
the secondary containment barrier. Check valves pro-
vide blocking action in all inlet lines except 844.
Controlled safety block valves are installed in line 844
 

and in the return lines as shown in Fig. 1.5.14. The
valves open when circuits 53 through 58 in Fig. 4.1.4
are energized. The operation of the safety interlocks in
these circuits is diagrammed in Fig. 4.8.2. If the level of
radiation in line 827 is excessive, three independent
switches (input group XVII) open to deenergize circuits
50, 51, and 52. Contacts on relays K50, K51, and K52
form a two-out-of-three matrix in each of the valve
circuits. Each matrix will open and deenergize the valve
if any two of the three relays are deenergized. Surge
tank (ST) purge valves ESV-ST-Al and -A2 serve as a
backup to FSV-837-A1, FSV-841-A1, FSV-846-A1, and
FSV-847-A1 and provide redundant blocking in the
system. The wiring for circuit 57, therefore, is physi-
cally separated from the wiring for the other cooling
water block valve circuits. '

The reactor thermal shield is protected from excessive
pressures by the self-actuated pressure control valve
PCV-844C. and the rupture disk in supply line 844. To
avoid unnecessary disk ruptures resulting from pressure
surges, control-grade interlock contact K106A in circuit
58 prevents supply valve FSV-844A1 from opening or
remaining open unless valve FSV-847A1 in the return

147

line is wide open. Contact K106A opens to deenergize -

circuit 58 when relay K106, Fig. 4.1.8, is deenergized.
Circuit 106 is completed through switches PSS-844B1,
PSS-855A1, and ZS-847A2. PSS-844B1 remains closed
as long as pressure in the inlet line is below 13 psig.
ZS-847A2, operated by valve stem position, is closed
only if valve FSV-847-A1 is 100% open. PSS-855-Al
remains closed unless the pressure in the line down-
stream from the rupture disk exceeds 5 psig. This line is
normally empty and is not under pressure unless the
disk is ruptured. Circuit 106 deenergizes automatically
if any one of the three pressure switches opens, but it
will not energize again until all three switches are closed
and ‘manual reset switch S119 is closed momentarily.
Under normal circumstances each of the valves, except
'ESV-ST-A in circuit 57, may be opened or closed by
operating a hand switch mounted on the water panel.

484 Containment Air System

. voltage magnetic motor-starting contactors.?

HCV-935A. The two valves and the damper are posi-
tioned by three identical operatois. Each operator is a
Limitorque' speed reduction gear driven by a %-hp
440-V, three-phase induction-type electric motor.
Damper HCV-934A1 in the radiator exhaust duct 934 is
positioned by a spring-loaded diaphragm-type pneu-
matic operator. Air pressure is applied to the operator
through the three-way solenoid valve HCV-934A2. The
damper is either opened or closed by energizing or
deenergizing the solenoid.

All of the above components except the fans and the
radiator exhaust damper may be operated from two
locations. One control station is mounted localy near
the equipment, and the other is mounted on MB3? in
the main control room. The fans and the radiator
exhaust damper are operated from MB3 only. Each
motor control station consists of two push-button
switches and two indicator lamps.

4.8.4.1 Stack fans. Although the stack fans are not

safety-grade components, it is important to maintain a
continuous flow of air through the contained areas,
particularly while the reactor is in operation (see Part
V, Sect. 6.1, Reactor Safety Analysis). Two fans are
provided to increase the reliability of the system. Either
one of the two has sufficient capacity to exhaust all of
the enclosures, but normally SF1 is the operating fan
and SF2 is placed in a standby condition. If for any
reason the flow stops or is significantly reduced,
pressure switches PS-927A1 and A2 (see Fig. 3.11.2)
operate automatically to start the standby fan SF2 and
stop fan SF1. Although the operator may choose to run
either fan, the automatic switching feature is available
only when SF1 is the operating fan and the SF2 control
circuit is placed in the automatic start mode.

The fan motors are connected to separate TVA power
distribution buses through two NEMA size 3 full-
The con-

- tactors are located in the switch-gear room. The

The third containment barrier is the containment air

system, described in Sect. 3.11. This system provides
~ controlled ventilation for all areas that surround the

secondary containment barrier. Two centnfugal fans,

SF1 and SF2, are used to induce air flow through these

areas as shown in Figs. 3.11.1 and 3.11.2. Both the

direction and the volume of flow are determined by the
positions - of two 30-in.-diam butterfly valves,
HCV-930A and HCV-930B, and the louvered damper

operating coils and auxiliary contacts are connected to
terminals in junction box JB26 (see Sect. 4.9.7) by a
12-conductor control cable. Individual wires extend
from JB26 to the control stations. -

The two fan motors are controlled by circuits 522
through 527 in Fig. 4.1.42. Operational logic diagrams
for the same circuits are shown in Fig. 4.1.68. Each
group of circuits receives 120-V control power from a

small step-down transformer connected to the line side -

of the motor starter. The contact positions shown in
Fig.. 4.1.42 indicate that both fans are off. When the

~control power buses are energized, the circuits remain

unchanged, but the green lamps in circuits 524 and 527
light up on MB3 to indicate that both motors are off
 

 

 

 

and the control power is on. The operator now has the
option of starting either fan by pressing the appropriate
push button — but if he chooses SF2, he must
remember that SF1 will not start automatically on a
loss of fan suction pressure. Electrical cross interlocks
K526C and K523C prevent the simultaneous operation
of both fans.

Both fans are controlled by conventional motor
starting circuits, but the two circuits have different
arrangements. The SF1 circuits, 522 and 523, are
designed to provide what is commonly called low-
voltage protection. The SF2 circuit, 526, is designed to
provide low-voltage release. _

Low-voltage protection is the term applied to a circuit
arrangement that will disconnect a motor from the
source of power if the voltage fails and requires that an
attendant operate the starting or control device to
restart the motor. This arrangement is used for motor
applications where unexpected starting cannot be per-
mitted.

Contacts S68 and S69 in SF1 control circuit 522
represent a two-button start-stop control station. The
push-button contacts are spring return and make or
break their contacts only momentarily while depressed.
Pushing the “start” button energizes relay coil K522;
time delay contact K522A closes instantly and en-
ergizes contactor coil CC523; the contactor closes, and
the drive motor on fan SF1 starts. Relay K523 is used
to provide additional auxiliary contacts for CC523.
Therefore, when CC523 energizes, relay K523 also
energizes and hold-in contact K523D closes to maintain
the flow of current in circuit 522 after the “start”
button is released; contact KS523A opens, contact
K523B closes, the green lamp goes out, and the red
lamp lights up to indicate that SF1 is running.

The addition of the time delay relay between the
push buttons and the contactor coil CC523 makes the
circuit appear unconventional, but it does not alter the
basic operating characteristics. Although the circuits are
designed to deenergize and remain deenergized when a
low-voltage condition develops, the slight delay in the
opening operation of contact K522A maintains the
continuity of the control circuits to keep the motor
running without further attention when momentary
power outages or voltage dips occur on the TVA power
line. If a sustained power failure occurs or the overload
relay contacts break the circuit, contact K522A opens,
contactor coil CC523 and relay K523 deenergize, and
hold-in contact K523D opens. The motor stops and will
not restart until the “start™ button is again depressed.
The overload relay must also be reset manually before
the motor can be restarted.

148

When SF1 is running, contacts CC523E and CC526E
in circuit 525 are closed, and three-way solenoid valves
FCV-925A and FCV925B are both energized. Air is
applied to both fan discharge dampers, FCO-925A and
FCO-925B; the SF1 damper is open, and the SF2
damper is closed. When SF2 is the operating fan, both
solenoids deenergize and vent both damper operators;
FCO-926A, the SF2 discharge damper, opens, and
FCO-925A, the SF1 discharge damper, closes to prevent
backflow through fan SF1. '

Low-voltage release is the term applied to a circuit
arrangement that stops a motor if the voltage fails, but
will permit the motor to restart automatically, with no
attention from an attendant, when normal voltage
returns. This arrangement is often used in applications
where continuous operations are important and auto-
matic startup interlocks are required.

S70 in SF2 control circuit 526 represents a two-
button start-stop push-button station with maintained
contacts. If the “start” button is closed, its contacts
remain closed until opened by pressing the “stop”
button. A time delay relay is not needed with this type
of push-button circuit. If voltage dips occur, the circuit
is maintained, and the contactor coil remains energized
unless the loss of voltage is sustained. The motor will

. restart automatically when the voltage is reapplied.

Relay K526 is used to provide additional auxiliary
contacts which operate simultaneously with coil
CC526.

The parallel-connected contacts K254A and K523C
just below the push button in circuit 526 are the SF2
automatic start interlocks. Contact K523C opens when
fan SF1 starts. If SF1 induces normal suction pressure
in the system, pressure switches PS-927A1 and -A2
close to energize relay K254, Fig. 4.1.19. This opens
contact K254A in circuit 526. After starting SF1, the

"operator closes the SF2 “start” button S70. SF2 does

not start because the two parallel interlocks are open,
but the white lamp 1-526 lights up on MB3 to signify
that the SF1 control circuit is in a standby condition. If
the SF1 suction pressure rises above 1 in. H, O negative,
contact K254A will close and energize the SF2 con-
tactor coil CC526. This will start fan SF2 and open
contact K526C in circuit 523 to stop fan SF1. In this
application it is more important to maintain continuous
operations than to protect the motor; therefore, no
overload relay contacts are included in circuit 526.
4.8.4.2 Reactor cell exhaust duct valves. The two
butterfly valves HCV-930A and B in the reactor cell
exhaust duct 930 (Fig. 3.11.1) have electric-motor-
driven operators. The motors are connected to TVA
power system bus G-3* through two three-phase full-
 

 

 

voltage reversing starters. Each starter employs two
magnetic contactors which are mechanically and electri-
cally interlocked so that both cannot be closed at the
same time. One contactor closes to run the motor in the
direction which opens the valve. When the other
- contactor closes, two of the motor connections to the
power line are reversed, and the motor runs in the
opposite direction to close the valve. _

The operating coils for the two contactors in each
starter are controlled by circuits 565 and 566, Fig.
4.1.44. Operational logic diagrams are shown in Fig.
4.1.68. The operation of circuit 565, which controls
valve HCV-930A, is typical, since the two cucutts are
identical.

When coil CCB565 is energized, the operator motor
runs in the direction which opens the valve. When coil
CCAS565 is energized, the valve moves to the closed
position. Contacts CCA565D and CCB563D are the
electrical cross interlocks which prevent the coils from
being energized simultaneously. Each control station
consists of two push buttons marked “open” and
“close.” The push:button contacts are spring return to
the open position. Operation of the “open™ or *“close”
button will energize the proper coil and close the
contactor to run the motor in the desired direction. The
motor will continue to run until the operator releases
the push button and deenergizes the contactor coil. The
coil will deenergize automatically and stop the motor if
one of the overload relay contacts opens or one of the
contacts on -the two operational limit switches,
XSS-930A and ZS-930A, opens. The limit switches are
operated by the Limitorque' drive unit. ZS-930A is a
gear-driven rotary drum switch which governs the valve
disk travel and energizes the valve position indicator
lamps (see circuits 480 and 481, Fig. 4.1.38) for both
the opening and closing directions of travel. XSS-930A
is a torque-actuated switch which also governs valve
disk travel in both directions. It operates to prevent
torque overload damage by limiting the amount of

thrust that can be exerted on the valve. disk when
seating or when moving against some obstruction in the

pipeline.

4.8.4.3 High-bay exhaust damper. The drwe motor
on the high-bay exhaust damper (HCV-935A, Fig.
3.11.1) is controlled by circuit 567, Fig. 4.1.44. This
circuit is identical to circuit 565, which is described in
Sect. 4.8.4.2. The valve position mdlcator lamps are
energlzed by circuit 482, Fig. 4.1.38.

4.8.4.4 Radiator enclosure exhaust damper Damperv

FCO-934A in radiator exhaust duct 934 operates in one
of two possible positions: fully open or closed. The

149

position is selected by operating manual switch
HS-934A in circuit 528, Fig. 4.1.42. When the switch is
closed, the three-way solenoid valve FCV-934A is
energized. Air pressure is applied to the pneumatic
operator, and the damper opens. The manual switch
HS-934A and the solenoid valve FCV-934A are both
mounted in containment air panel CAP-1.* This is a
weatherproof panel that is located immediately to the
south of Building 7503.

4.9 AUXILIARY PROCESS CONTROL

As previously stated, the MSRE and its instrumenta-
tion and control systems may be viewed as a primary
reactor system plus the collection of auxiliary systems
required to run the primary system. The discussions in
previous sections have been concerned mainly with
control circuits for those elements which exert a direct

- and immediate influence on the 'status, of operating
conditions in the reactor primary systems. The follow-
ing paragraphs describe control circuits for auxiliary

systems which provide services that are essential to the

operation of the primary system.

There is a strong incentive to maintain contmuous
operation at the MSRE; therefore, the auxiliary systems
are designed to minimize undesirable and unnecessary
shutdowns caused by equipment failures and electrical
 

 

power interruptions. Redundant components are pro-
vided in each system. A loss of service from one unit is
annunciated, and immediate transfer of the operating
load to the spare unit is accomplished by the operator
in the main control room. In some auxiliary systems,
such as instrument air compressors and lube oil pumps,
the transfer operation occurs automatically. Loss of

150

service due to power interruptions is avoided by

connecting redundant units and their control circuits to

separate TVA power distribution buses which in emer-
gencies may be supplied from diesel generators or a .

battery-powered system. Shutdowns caused by spurious
voltage transients on the control circuit power supplies
are avoided by incorporating a time delay in the
operation of seal-in contacts used with momentary push
buttons.

The operation of the control circuits for each
auxiliary system is described in the following para-

graphs.

4.9.1 Containment Vessel Pressure Control

The pressure in the reactor and drain tank contain-
ment vessels is controlled by circuits 80, 84, 85, and 98
(see Fig. 4.1.6, 4.1.7, and 4.1.8). These circuits are
discussed in Sect. 4.8.3.4.

4.9.2 Instrument Air Compressors

Pneumatic instruments are vital components in the
reactor safety and control systems, and a dependable
supply of clean, dry air is essential for reliable and
continuous operations. This supply is provided by the
instrument air system.! Two vertical water-cooled
reciprocating-type air compressors, each capable of
delivering 100 scfm of air at a pressure of 80 psig, are at
the heart of the system. Figure 4.9.1 is a simplified
diagram of the compressors and their control elements.

Each compressor, driven by a 40-hp 480-V, three-
phase induction-type electric motor, is capable of
supplying 100% of the plant’s requirements. The
motors are connected to separate power distribution
buses? through two NEMA size 3 full-voltage magnetic
motor-starting contactors as shown in Fig. 4.9.2. The
starters and control interlock relays are mounted on the
south wall of the diesel house near the compressors.3

The operator’s controls are mounted on main board
MB12.* These consist of two sets of push-button
switches for starting and stopping the motors, two sets
of on-off indicating lamps, and one operational mode
selector switch S53. The mode of operation, either
manual or semiautomatic, is determined by placing the
selector switch in one of three positions: “compressor

1,” “manual,” and “compressor No. 2.” Semiautomatic
operation is achieved by selecting a compressor, either
No. 1 or No. 2, to be the operating machine. The.
selected machine is started manually by closing the
appropriate push-button switches and runs continu-
ously to maintain the pressure in main supply line 9000
at some value between 75 and 85 psig. If this pressure
falls below 70 psig, the standby machine will start
automatically. With switch S53 in the *“‘manual” posi-
tion, the automatic startup feature is inactive, and
neither compressor will start unless the “start” push
button is closed. Regardless of selector switch position,
the push buttons may be used to operate the compres-
sors individually or simultaneously. Once started, a
compressor will continue to run until the operator
opens the “stop” push button or it is shut down
automatically by the protective interlocks.

‘The two compressor motor starters are controlled by
identical circuits as shown in Fig. 4.9.2. Both operating
coils, CC501 and CC504, are energized by conventional
motor starting circuits 501 and 504, The arrangement
of the momentary-contact-type push-button switches
and the seal-in interlocks is typical of this type of
circuit. Relay contacts, operated by pressure-actuated
switches in circuits 300 and 301, combine in both
circuits with contacts on selector switch $53 to provide
the automatic startup feature for the standby compres-
sor. Operating restrictions are imposed on circuit 501 -
by the permissive-to-run interlock circuit 302; an
identical circuit, 307, imposes the same restrictions on
circuit 504. '

The operation of the circuits controlling air compres-
sor 1 is typical of both machines. With the circuits as
shown in Fig. 4.9.2, the operational status of the
system is as follows: the pressure in main supply line
9000 is zero, all relay and contactor coils are deener-
gized, and both compressors are off. When the control
power buses are energized, the circuits remain un-
changed, but the green lamps in circuits 502 and 505
light up in the main control room to indicate that both
compressor motors are off and that both motor starter
circuits are ready. |

The compressors will not start unless the operator
first energizes permissive interlock circuits 302 and 307.
If the temperatures of the compressed air and the
cooling water leaving the head of compressor 1 are not
too high, the temperature switch contacts TS-AC1-A
and B in circuit 302 will be closed. When the
momentary-contact-type push button S56 (located in
the diesel house) is closed, relay coil K302 is energized
by the flow of current through the temperature
switches, the push-button switch, and the normally
 

 

 

 

closed relay contact KASOIA. At the same time,
contact K302A, connected in parallel wnth S56, closes.
When the operator releases the momentary-contact type
push-button switch §56, relay K302 remains energized
through the seal-in contact K302A instead of through
switch §56. Compressor 2 permissive circuit 307 oper-
ates the same way when reset push button S59 is closed
momentarily.

When circuits 302 and 307 energize, relay contacts
K302B and K307B close to remove the operating
restrictions from motor starter circuits 501 and 504.
Neither compressor is running at this point, and the
operator has the option of placing the operational mode
selector - switch S53 in the ‘“manual” position or
selecting oné of the two compressors as the operating
unit. The operation of circuit 501 is the same regardless
of the selector switch position, but for this illustration
the switch is placed in the ‘“‘compressor 1> position.
This closes contacts SS3C in circuit 301 and S53E in
circuit 504 to activate the automatic startup feature for
compressor 2. The automatic startup circuit consists of
three series-connected contacts, S53E, K300C, and
K301C, in parallel with the “start” push-button switch
S58. The switch is bypassed and the compressor starts
automatically when all three contacts close at the same
time. The compressor does not start automatically at
this point in the startup operation, even though the
system pressure is zero, because relay contact K301C is
open and will not close until the pressure rises above 70
psig and energizes circuits 300 and 301.

So far there has been no change in the operating
status of the system; the pressure in line 9000 is zero,
all relay and contactor circuits except 302 and 307 are
deenergized, and neither compressor is running.

To start compressor 1 the operator momentarily
closes push-button switch S55, and the magnetic starter
operating coil CC501 is energized by the flow of
current  through the permissive . interlock contact
K302B, the “stop” button, coil CCS50I, and  the
overload relay contacts, The starter contacts CC501A,

151

In circuit 502, contact KBSO1B opens and contact
KB501 A closes; the green indicator lamp goes out and
the red lamp lights up on main board MB12 to indicate
that compressor 1 is running,.

Contact KB501C closes to energize one branch of
circuit 500, which opens cooling water supply valve
FCV-880A. The valve shuts off the flow of cooling
water when the compressor is not running to prevent
rust-producing condensation from forming on the cylin-
der wall.

2. Time ' delay relay KASO] connected in parallel
with motor contactor coil CC501, also energizes to
operate two contacts: contact KASO1A opens in circuit
302, and contact KAS01B closes in circuit 500.

The compressor would be damaged if operated even
for a short time without a supply of lubricating oil. If
the supply fails, contact KASO1A operates in parallel

- with oil pressure switch PS-AC1-C to shut off the

-B, and -C close, and the motor starts, Several other

events occur simultaneously with the starting of the
motor These are: '

I. Auxnhary contact CCS01D on the starter closes to
energize relay coil KB501. This in turn. operates
additional auxiliary contacts KB501A, -B, C and -Din
circuits 500, 501, and 502. ,

Contact KB501D, connected in paralleI w1th the
“start” button S$55, closes to maintain the flow of
current through coil CC501 so that the motor will
continue to run when the “start” button is released.

compressor motor. The switch closes at 25 psig when
the oil pressure increases and opens at 15 psig when the
pressure decreases. Since the lube oil pump is driven by
the compressor motor, the oil pressure is zero and the
switch is open when the motor first starts. Several
seconds elapse before the pressure builds up enough to
close the switch. In the interval, circuit 302 remains
energized through relay contact KA501A, but KASO1A
is timed to open 7 sec after contactor CC501 closes to
start the compressor motor. If the oil pressure fails to
close switch PS-AC1-C before contact KASO1A opens,
relay coil K302 will deenergize to open contact K302B
in circuit 501 and shut off the compressor motor. Once
closed, switch PS-AC1-C will not open and shut off the
compressor motor unless the lube oil pressure falls
below 15 psig.

Contact KAS501B closes circuit 500 a few seconds
after the compressor motor is started. This allows
solenoid valve PCV-ACI-E to energize and load the
compressor. The closing of contact KASO1B is delayed
to prevent the compressor from :loading before the
motor has had a chance to reach its normal operating
speed. s
The compressor motor runs contmuously at a con-
stant speed, and the head pressure is regulated by the
automatic operation of the “unloading” valve. Thisisa
pneumatically operated relief valve built into the
compressor cylinder head. Air is supplied to the
operator through the three-way solenoid valve PCV-
ACI1-E as shown in Fig. 4.9.1. When the solenoid is
deenergized, the air supply is shut off, the operator is
vented to atmosphere, and the unloading valve is forced

- open by spring action; compression is prevented, and

the compressor is “unloaded.” When the solenoid is
energized, air pressure is applied to the operator to
close the “unloading™ valve, compression resumes, and
the compressor ‘“loads.” The compressor alternately
“loads” and ‘“‘unloads” as pressure switch PS-AC1-D
 

 

 

152

closes and opens circuit 500 in response to the pressure
in the receiver tanks, When the tank pressure rises to 85
psig, PS-AC1-D opens, solenoid valve PCV-ACI-E is
deenergized, and the compressor “unloads.” When the
tank pressure falls below 75 psig, PS-AC1-D closes,
PCV-ACI1-E is energized, and the compressor *“loads.”

The above events occur simultaneously with the
closing of motor starting contactor CC501. Both
permissive-to-run circuits, 302 and 307, remain ener-
gized. The system pressure is still near zero, but
compressor 1 is now running, and the pressure begins to
increase. With selector switch S53 in the “‘compressor
1 position, compressor 2 is in the automatic startup
mode but does not start at this point, even though the
system pressure is low, because relay K301 is not yet
energized and contact K301C in circuit 504 is open.

As the pressure rises above 70 psig, pressure switch
PS-9000-2 closes to energize relay K300; contact
K300A closes in circuit 301, and contact K300B, the
automatic start interlock fotr compressor 2, opens in
circuit 504. Relay K301 is energized by the flow of
current through contacts S53C and K300A and remains
energized through seal-in contact K301A. This makes
the operation of circuit 301 independent of relay K300,
and relay K301 will remain energized until the operator
returns selector switch S53 to the “manual™ position.

The system is now operating normally, with compres-
sor 1 running and circuit 500 controlling the system
pressure between the limits of 75 and 85 psig. As long
as the system pressure is maintained above 70 psig,
relay K300 will be energized, and the automatic start
interlock K300C in circuit 504 will remain open, but
the moment it drops below 70 psig, relay K300 will
deenergize to close contact K300C, and compressor 2
will start automatically. Both machines will continue to
run unless they are stopped intentionally by operator
action or automatically by the operation of the
protective interlocks. Pressure switch PS-9000-1 (see
Fig. 4.9.1) opens in circuit 988 (see Fig. 4.1.55) to
annunciate the low-pressure condition in the auxiliary
control room. ‘

Abnormal operating conditions will open temperature
and pressure switch contacts to deenergize circuit 302
and shut down compressor 1. It cannot be started again
until the condition is corrected and the operator resets
relay K302. If either circuit 302 or 307 deenergizes,
contact K302C or K307C will open in circuit 990 to
sound an alarm in the auxiliary control room.

Both motor starter control circuits are powered by
individual step-down transformers connected to the line
side of the starting contacts. This arrangement deener-
gizes the contactor coil and disconnects the motor from
the supply line when TVA power fails. When the power
returns, the motor will not restart without the opera-
tor’s attention unleéss the automatic start mode is in
force. -

Unnecessary and confusing operations resulting from
electrical power interruptions and voltage fluctuations
are avoided by connecting the control interlock circuits,
300, 301, 302, and 307, to the 115-V ac reliable power
supply. Permissive-to-run circuits 302 and 307 are
connected to separate buses so that a loss of power on a
single bus cannot disable both machines. -

4.9.3 Lube Oil Pumps

For normal operations both the fuel- and coolant-salt
circulating pumps require a continuous supply of
lubricating and cooling oil. Neither pump can be started
until the required oil flow rates are established, and
these flow rates must be maintained to keep them
running. The oil is supplied by separate but identical
pumping systems which serve to lubricate and cool the
pump bearings and to cool the shield plug located
between the bearings and the pump bowl (see Part I,
Sects. 5.4.1.4 and 8.3.1). _}

Each oil system consists basically of a water-cooled
oil reservoir, two centrifugal pumps piped in parallel,
and an oil filter, all mounted in a supporting framework
which is enclosed to form a unitized package. The two
packages are located adjacent to each other in the
service tunnel area. Flow diagrams of the systems are
shown in Figs. 3.7.0 and 3.7.1. The instrumentation
shown on these diagrams is described in Sect. 3.7.

The oil pump motor control circuits are diagrammed
in Figs. 4.1.32 and 4.1.41. Operational logic diagrams
for the circuits are shown in Fig. 4.1.70. Since the two
oil systems are identical, the operation of the fuel
system circuits, as described here and in Fig. 4.9.3, will
serve as a general illustration of the control circuits for
both systems.

The two pumps, FOP-1 and FOP-2, are driven by 5-hp
240-V ac three-phase induction-type electric motors.
The motors are connected to separate power distribu-
tion busesS through two NEMA size 1 full-voltage
magnetic motor-starting contactors. The starter for
FOP-2 is mounted on the wall of the service tunnel near
the pump, while FOP-1 is supplied from motor control
center G3 in the switchgear room. Each starter is
controlled by two push-button stations, one located on
main board MB10% and the other on auxiliary board
OP3,7 which is mounted directly on the pump package
in the service tunnel. The station on MB10 has two
buttons, one marked “start” and the other “stop,”
while the station on OP3 has only one, marked “stop.”
Both stations utilize two indicating lamps, one red to
indicate that the pump motor is on and one green to
indicate that it is off. The pumps are normally operated
from MB10, and the buttons on OP3 are used only if
emergency stopping is required or for testing purposes.
 

 

 

Cormresponding control switches and lamps for the
coolant-salt system oil pumps, COP-1 and COP-2, are
located on main board MB4® and auxiliary panel OP4.3

Pump operations are semiautomatic. The push but-
tons may be used at the operator’s discretion to operate
the pumps individually or simultaneously, but if either
one of the two is in operation, the second or standby
pump will start automatically whenever the oil pressure
in the discharge line of the operating pump falls below
45 psig. This startup feature is completely automatic,
and the operator has no control over its functions.

The operating status of the system with the control -

circuits as shown in Fig. 4.9.3 is as follows: the control
power buses are energized, but all relay and contactor
coils are deenergized; the green lamps in circuits 507
and 509 are lit and are visible in the main control room
and in the service tunnel. Since both motor starters are
controlled by identical circuits, the operating sequence
for the FOP-1 circuit is typical of both machines. The
operation of FOP-1 is initiated when push-button
switch S42 in circuit 303 is closed momentarily. This

energizes relay KB303 to close contacts KB303A in

circuit 303 and KB303B in circuit 506.

Closing contact KB303A energizes time delay relay
KA303, which remains energized through seal-in con-
tact KA303F. A second contact, KA303A, combines
with pressure switch PS-701-B2 in circuit 308 to form
the automatic starting circuit for FOP-2. The discussion
of this circuit will be continued later.

When contact KB303B closes in circuit 506, time
delay relay K506 energizes and closes contact KS06A
instantaneously; the motor starter operating coil is then
energized by the flow of current from transformer
terminal X1, through time delay contact K506A,
contactor coil CC506, the overload relay contacts, to
terminal X2; the starter contacts CC506A, -B, and -C
close, and the pump motor starts. Energizing coil
CC506 starts the motor and initiates two other opera-
tions simultaneously: First, in circuit 507, contact
CCS06F opens and contact CCS06E closes; the green
lamps go out and the red lamps light up to indicate that
FOP-1 is runnmg Second, contact CC506D, which is
connected in parallel with the FOP-1 “start” button
842, closes to maintain the flow of current through
relay coil KB303 when the “start” button is released;

the contactor operating coil CC506 remains energized, -

‘and the motor continues to run,

At this point in the startup sequence the 0perat10nal .
status of the system is as follows: relays KA303,KB303 -

and K506 and contactor coil CCS506 are all energized;
FOP-1 is running, and the discharge pressure in line 701
begins to increase. The pressure is monitored by switch
PS-701-B2, which, as previously mentioned, operates a

contact in circuit 308. The series-connected contacts -

PS-701-B2 and KA303A are in parallel with the FOP-2
“start” button $45. Whenever both contacts are closed

153

at the same time, the “start” switch is automatically
bypassed, and relay KB308 energizes to start FOP-2.

When FOP-1 first starts, the discharge pressure is low,
and switch contact PS-701-B2 is closed, but FOP-2 does
not start automatically because the time delay contact
KA303A is open and remains open for 5 sec. Normally
the discharge pressure will rise above 45 psig in less than
5 sec and open switch contact PS-701-B2 before
contact KA303A closes. If the system functions prop-
erly, the FOP-1 discharge pressure rises above 435 psig,
PS-701B2 opens, and contact KA303A closes. FOP-1
is now in operation, and FOP-2 is in a standby condition.
If the FOP-1 discharge pressure falls below 45 psig,
pressure switch PS-701-B2 will close the FOP-2 auto-
matic start circuit. Pressure switches PS-701-B1 and
PS-702-B1 open in circuit 847 to sound an alarm in the
main control room if discharge pressure at both pumps
is low.

It is obvious from the foregoing explanation that the
purpose of the time delay contact KA303A in circuit
308 is to prevent the standby pump from starting
automatically while the selected pump is building the
system pressure up to the normal operating value. It
also prevents the standby pump from starting when the
operating pump is stopped manually. If the FOP-1 stop
button S41 is pressed, relays KA303 and KB303
deenergize, FOP-1 stops, and contact KA303A opens
instantaneously in circuit 308 to prevent FOP-2 from
starting,

The pump motor and the motor starter operating coil
CC506 are both energized from the same TVA supply

~ bus. Sustained power outages will deenergize the coil

and disconnect the motor from the power line. The
motor will not restart when the power returns without
operator attention. The purpose of the time delay relay
K506 is to hold the contactor closed during momentary
outages and voltage dips so that the motor will continue
to run without operator attention when the power
system retums to normal. When voltage dips occur on
the line, relay K506 drops out almost immediately, but
the opening of contact KS06A is delayed a few seconds,
and CC506 remains energized. The coil will hold the
contactor closed if the voltage does not g0 below 60%
of the rated coil voltage.

‘The load on each pump is determmed by measunng
the current in one phase of each motor. Two current
transformers, one for each pump motor, are connected

to a single ammeter through a selector switch as shown

in Fig. 4.9.3. An identical circuit measures the coolant
salt system oil pump motor currents. The two ammeters

- and the two selector switches are located in the service
room on auxiliary control panel OP2.

‘Circuit 305 controls valve PCV-703-Bl in the fuel
pump lubricating oil line 703. Oil leaking past the lower
shaft seal of the pump into the fuel salt would cause the
oil level to drop in reservoir OT1. When the level drops,
 

 

 

switch contact LSS-OT1-A3 opens to deenergize circuit
305 and close the valve.

4.9.4 Component Coolant Pump

Control circuits 312, 313, 314, and 315 shown in Fig.
4.1.33 control the operation of component coolant
pumps CCP 1 and CCP 2 through power system circuit
breakers H and E. Although the purposes for and the
arrangements of the protective interlocks (group 1 and
group 11 in Fig. 4.2.2.1) are different, the basic scheme
devised for opening and closing the circuit breakers is
the same as that described for the fuel salt pump in
Sect. 4.2.2. One difference is the safety-grade classifica-
tion for part of the wiring in all of the above circuits.
One requirement of safety is that the integrity of the
secondary containment vessel be protected from exces-
sive yacuum pressure. This pressure can be produced by
the component coolant pumps. If high pressure exists in
the vessel, all of the K85 relay contacts (see Fig. 4.1.7)
will open to shut off both pumps and prevent them
from being started again until the pressure has returned
to normal. The K85 relay contacts, the relays in circuits
312 and 314, and the wiring between are therefore
installed to meet safety system requirements. ‘

As far as their operation is concerned, CCP 2 control
circuits 314 and 315 are identical to circuits 312 and
313, which control CCP 1. Protective interlocks in each
set of circuits impose two restrictions on the operation
of the pumps. First, both cannot run simultaneously,
and second, neither will continue to operate without a
supply of lube oil. The capacity of the plant’s electrical
power distribution system is not enough to operate two
pumps at once, but this is not necessary, since one
pump is capable of supplying all of the component
cooling air needed to operate the reactor system.

The operation of CCP 1 is typical. If both pumps are
off and reactor cell pressure is normal, relays KB312
and KB314 are energized, and the operator has the
option to start either pump by momentarily closing one
of the “start” switches. If S61 in Fig. 4.9.4 is closed,
circuit breaker H closes to start CPP 1. At the same
time, auxiliary contact a, also on circuit breaker H,
closes to energize relay K313. Contact K313E immedi-
ately opens control circuit 314 to prevent the operation
of CCP 2. Parallel contacts K313B and PS791A operate
to shut off the coolant pump motor unless the lube oil
pressure rises above 5 psig (referenced to reactor cell
atmosphere)} within 15 sec after startup. Before the
pump starts, PS791A is open, and relay K312, which
operates the trip coil in circuit breaker H, is energized
through the normally closed time delay contact K313B.
Since the lube oil pump is driven by the coolant pump
motor, several seconds elapse after the motor starts
before the oil pressure increases enough to close switch
contact PS791A. Contact K313B is timed to open 15

154

sec after the coolant pump is started, and if PS791A
does not close within this time period, relay KB312 will
deenergize and shut the pump off. '

This is also an appropriate time to discuss the
operation of the three-way solenoid valve
HCV-PdCV-960A2 in circuit 146, Fig. 4.1.12. This
valve is part of the system which automatically controls
the differential pressure across the component coolant
pumps. When the differential pressure across the pumps
is less than 1.3 psi (startup conditions), switch contact
PdS-960A2 is open, and the solenoid valve is deener-
gized. This shuts off the supply of instrument air to the
controlling instrument PdI-960A. No signal is transmit-
ted to control valve PACV-960A, and it remains wide
open. When the differential pressure rises above 1.3 psi,
switch contact PdS-960A2 closes circuit 146 and
energizes PACV-960A2. This restores the supply of air
to the pressure controller, and the control valve moves
slowly to a throttling position. The complete control
system is fully described in Sect. 3.6.

4.9.5 Steam Dome Feedwater Control

The steam dome feedwater control valves in circuits

143, 144, and 145 (see Fig. 4.1.12) are part of the drain-

tank afterheat removal system, which is discussed in
Sect. 4.2.9. The steam dome condensate drain valves in
circuit 81 (see Fig. 4.1.6) are discussed in Sect. 4.8.3.5.

4.9.6 Cover Gas System

The MSRE cover gas system supplies helium for use as
an inert gas above the salt surfaces, as described in Part
I, Sect. 10. The system consists of a helium supply,
dryers, oxygen removal units, a treated helium storage
tank, and various valve manifolds and distribution
piping, all instrumented as indicated in Fig. 3.5.

Helium is normally supplied from tanks mounted on a
trailer parked at the northwest corner of the diesel
house. Since it must be essentially free of water vapor
and oxygen to reduce the likelihood of oxide precipita-
tion in the salt, the helium is passed through one of two
parallel-connected helium-treating systems installed in
the line between the trailer and the treated helium
storage tank. The two treatment systems are located in
the second bay of the diesel house, and each one
consists of three units: a helium dryer, a preheater, and
an oxygen removal unit. The units are heated to
operating temperatures by separate electrical-resistance-
type heaters. These heaters are energized and automati-
cally controlled by the six identical groups of circuits
shown in Fig. 4.1.35 and 4.1.36.

- The group controlling preheater 1 in Fig. 4.1.35 is a

typical example. The heating element and the control

- circuits are connected to a 220-V, single-phase ac

supply through a combination motor starter. The gas
temperature controller, TIC-PHI-1, and the heating
 

element in circuit 403 are energized directly from the
220-V bus, which is connected to':the load side of
circuit breaker CB-1. The temperature controller
TS-PH1-2, the heater contactor operating coil K401,
and control relays K400, K401, and K402 are energized
from a separate 110-V bus supplied by a step-down
transformer that is also connected to the load side of
circuit breaker CB-1.

The temperature control instruments, the contactors,
and the relays are all mounted on two auxiliary control
panels, CG1 and CG2,!? together with the operator’s
push-button switches, indicating lamps, and 4 variable
autotransformer. The two panels are located in the
diesel house near the helium treatment units.

When circuit breaker CB-1 is open, control circuits
400 through 403 are all deenergized. This is the
condition of the circuits as shown in Fig. 4.1.35. To
energize preheater 1, the operator first closes CB-1; the
green lamp in circuit 402 lights up immediately to
indicate that the control power buses are energized;
temperature controller TS-PH1-2 is energized, and cur-
rent flows through the two closed contacts in circuit
400 to energize relay K400; contact K400A closes in
circuit 401, but the contactor coil K401 remains
deenergized because of the open push-button switch
HS-PH1-1. The temperature controller TS-PH1-2 reads a
temperature signal from a thermocouple embedded in
the heating element. The controller operates the two
contacts in circuit 400, but they remain closed unless
the temperature of the heating element becomes exces-
sive or the continuity of the thermocouple circuit is
broken. In either case, relay K400 deenergizes to open
contact K400A, which deenergizes contactor coil K401
to shut off the heating element.

If the system is operating normmally when CB-1 is
closed, the indicated temperature is below the limit and
control set points on both TS-PH1-2 and TIC-PH1-1,
the two contacts-in circuit 400 are closed, and contact

155

the green lamp goes out, and the red lamp lights up to
indicate that power is applied to heater circuit 403. The
gas temperature rises until the indication on controller
TICPH1-1 exceeds the set point and contact TIC-PH1-1
opens circuit 403 to deenergize the heating element.
The controller alternately opens and closes contact
TIC-PHI-1, turning the heater on and off to maintain
the desired gas temperature.

The voltage applied to the heater can be varied
between 0 and 220 V by manually adjusting the
variable autotransformer in heater circuit 403. Thus the
maximum amount of heat available to the system is
adjustable, since the power output of the heater is
proportional to the square of the applied voltage. This

~adjustment is made by trial and error to get optimum

TIC-PH1-1 in heater circuit 403 is closed. Power is

applied to the heating element when the operator
momentarily closes the “on™ contact on push-button
switch HS-PH1-1 and energizes contactor.coil K401 to
close contact K401C in circuit 403. The heater is
energized by the flow of current from the H (hot) bus,
through the variable autotransformer, controller con-

control for a given set of operating conditions.

If the relay in circuit 400 or any of the corresponding
relays in the other five heater circuits deenergize, one of
the contacts in circuit 402 opens to deenergize relay
K402. Contact K402A opens circuit 965 (Fig. 4.1.54)
to annunciate the high-temperature condition in one of
the heating elements.

4.9.7 Miscellaneous Motor Controls

Circuits 514 through 521, Fig. 4.1.41, and circuits
529 through 564, Figs. 4.1.42 and 4.1.43, control
induction-type electrical motors which drive the follow-
ing auxiliary units:

MB2, MB4 Radiator annulus blowers Fig. 3.3.1

CCC1,CCC2 Coolant cell space cooler fans Fig. 3.8.0
peCc Drain tank cell space cooler fan Fig. 3.8.0

'Each motor is connected to a TVA 480-V three-phase
power bus through a fullvoltage magnetic motor
starter.!2 The starters are mounted in the separate
compartments of two unitized motor control centers,
G-3 and G-4, located in the switchgear room (see Part 1,

~Sect. 19, Descrlptlon of Reactor Design). Each starter

tact TIC-PH1-1, contact K401C, and the heating ele-

ment, to the N (neutral) bus. When the operator
releasés the *‘on” button, circuit 401 remains com-
pleted through the “off” button on switch HS-PHI-1,
contact 'K400A, and also through a “holding” contact

K401B which closed when the contactor coil- K401

energized.: If either the “off” button or contact K400A
opens, even momentarily, coil K401 drops out and
contact K401B opens, breaking the control circuit until
the “on” button is pressed once again.

When the contactor coil is energized, contact K401D
in lamp circuit 402 opens and contact K401A closes,

unit consists of a magnetically operated contactor and
circuit breaker combination. The circuit breaker serves
as a manual disconnect switch and provides short-circuit
protection for the motor and starter circuits. The TVA
bus is an mtegral part of the control centers, and each
starter is convemently connected to the bus by a special
plug-in arrangement. Individual steel conduits carry the
wires between the motor starters in the switchgear
room and the motors located throughout Building
7503. ,

The operator controls for all of the motor starters are
located in the main control room. Each starter except
 

 

the two serving MB2 and MB4 is controlled by a
push-button station mounted on main board MB12.13
Push-button stations for MB2 and MB4 are mounted on
main board MB4. Each station includes two push-
button switches, one marked “start” and the other
marked “stop,” and two indicating lamps. The red lamp
~ lights up when the motor is running, and the green lamp
lights up when it is not running.
The operating coils and auxiliary contacts on each
motor starter are individually wired to the terminals of

156

a centrally located junction box. The junction box,

JB26,'4 is mounted beneath the main control room on
a wall that is accessible from the 840-ft level of Building
7503. A 12-conductor control cable extends from the
junction box to each starter compartment in the motor
control center. Individual wires extend from JB26 to
the control stations. Jumper wires between terminal
points in JB26 interconnect the contactor coils and
contacts with the control station push buttons and
lamps.

All of the starters are controlled by identical circuit
configurations. The configuration formed by circuits
529, 530, and 531 (Fig. 4.1.42) to control treated
water pump 1 (TWP-1) is a typical example. This is the
conventional low-voltage-protection-type circuit which
is described in Sect. 4.8.4.1. The addition of a time
delay relay K529 between the push buttons and the
contactor operating coil CC523 makes the circuit
appear unconventional, but the basic operating charac-
teristics are not altered.

The TWP-1 circuits obtain a 120-V supply of power
from a small step-down control transformer that is also
connected to the line side of the motor starting
contactor. When the contacts are in the positions shown
in Fig. 4.1.42, the pump motor is off. When the control
power bus is energized, the circuit remains unchanged
except for the green lamp in circuit 531 which lights up
on MB3 to indicate that the motor is not running and
the control power is on,

Contacts 871 and S72 in circuit 529 represent the
two-button start-stop control station. The push-button
contacts are spring return and make or break their
contacts only momentarily while depressed. Pushing the
“start” button energizes relay coil K529; time delay
contact K529A closes instantly and energizes contactor
coil CC530. The coil closes the power-line contacts to
start the motor and at the same time closes seal-in
contact CC530D to maintain the flow of current in
circuit 529 when the “start” button is released.
Contactor coil CC530 also operates the two contacts in
lamp circuit 531. When the coil energizes, contact
CC530F opens, and contact CCS30E closes; the green

lamp goes out and the red lamp lights up to indicate
that TWP-1 is running.

The time delay relay helps maintain the continuity of
system operations by preventing needless pump shut-
downs. Although the circuit is designed to deenergize

and remain deenergized when a low-voltage condition

develops, the slight delay incorporated in the opening
operation of contact K522A maintains the continuity
of the control circuits during short intervals when
disturbances such as momentary power failures or
voltage dips occur on the TVA power system. This
keeps the motor connected to the power system during
such intervals so that it continues to run without
further attention from the operator when the power
system returns to normal. If a power failure lasts for
more than a few seconds or the overload relay contacts
open, or if the “stop” button is depressed for a few
seconds, contactor coil CC530 deenergizes and remains
deenergized. The motor stops and will not restart until
the “start” button is again depressed. If the overload
relay operates, it must be reset manually before the
motor can be restarted.

Another group of motors which drive the pump room
sump pumps, the pump room pit pump, the waste
pump, and the waste tank blower are controlled by
locally mounted starters and push-button stations. The
control circuits for these motor starters are not identi-
fied by the instrumentation and controls numbering
system (see Sect. 7.2). However, the circuit designs are
essentially the same as those described above.! 3

Operational logic diagrams for all of the control
circuits discussed in this section are shown in Fig.
4.1.64,4.1.70,4.1.71, and 4.1.72.

4.9.8 Fuel and Coolant Pump Level System Circuits

It is obvious from the descriptions of the master
control circuits given in Sect. 4.2 that salt levels,
particularly those in the fuel- and coolant-salt pump
bowls and in the fuel pump overflow tank, are very
important operating parameters in the MSRE system.
At every stage of reactor operations, electrical inter-
locks operate automatically as the salt levels change to
impose restrictions on the use of the fill and drain
control circuits, the operational mode selector circuits,
and the circulating pump motor control circuits. The
interlock contacts are actuated by pilot devices that
operate in response to signals generated by the three
level measuring systems shown in Fig. 4.9.5.

An examination of the diagrams in Fig. 4.9.5 reveals
that each pump bowl measuring system utilizes only
one set of control-grade pilot devices and one level

O
 

 

 

157 .

recorder but that each set of devices as well ‘as the
recorder may receive signals from more than one level
detector. The devices in the fuel “system may be
connected to either one of two bubbler-type level
- detectors, LT-596B and LT-593C; those in the coolant

system may be connected to any one of three detectors.

“Two of the three, LT-598C and LT-595C, are bubbler- L
type detectors that generate pneumatic output signals, |
2, Circuits 66, 67, and 68 (Flg 4, 1 S), overflow tank

but the third detector, LE-CP-A, utilizes-a ball float

~ with a differential transformer to generate an electrical
* output signal which is then converted to a pneumatic
signal (Sect. 6. 9) In both systems the connection -
between the single set of pilot devices and one of the

two bubbler-type . detectors " is determined by the
position of a three-way. solenoxd—operated valve:

HCV.593C ‘in the fuel pump ' level system ‘and ..

HCV-598C1 in the coolant pump system. In the latter

system the output signal from the selected bubbler-type
detector is passed through a second three-way solenoid -
‘valve, HCV-598C2, which is-also connected to the -

pneumatic output signal from level element LE-CP-A.

" The connection between the pilot devices and one of
these two signal sources is detemuned by the posmon :
~of the valve.

- No.control-grade plIOt devices are connected to the
overflow tank level system. The outputs from the two .

bubbler-type detectors, LT-599B and LT-600B, have no
common connection. Each detector operates a separate

safety-grade pilot device. Contacts on these devices are .
used in safety circuits 18 and ]9 which are descnbed in -
Sect. 4.7.2. : .
~ The three bubbler-type level detector systems in Fig
4.9.5 are all identical. Each system requires a constant
flow of purge gas through the dip tube and reference -
pressure lines. The gas is -supplied through three
solenmd-operated block “valves. The -level signals are

obtained from two differential pressure transmitters

- connected between each dip tube line and the reference -
pressure line together with two equahzmg valves. For -
normal operating conditions the block vaIves remain
.open-and the equalizing valves remain closed. . -~
The above description of the salt level ‘instrument -
systems is very brief, but it provides the basis needed to
understand the control circuit description which is to

follow. A more detailed description of the bubbler-type

~ level elements, the differential pressure transmitters,

- and the weld-sealed valves is given in Sects. 5.8.1, 6.8,
- and 6.1.9. The operation of the instruments in all three -
systems is also discussed in Chap. 3, Sects. 3.1, Fuel Salt

Circulating System, and 3 3, Coolant Salt Circulating
System

It should be"appatent from the foregoirig discussion

‘that the control elements in all three systems are the

solenoid valves which . are  operated by opening and

~ closing manual switch contacts in the following groups

of circuits:

1. Circuits’ 63, 64 65, and 69 (Flg 4.1.5), fuel pump
" bowl level system.

level system.

,3 C1rcu1ts 75, 76, 717, 78 and 79 (Fig. 4.1 6) coolant

pump bowl level systems.

In each system- the valve operations must be carefully

- coordinated to avoid misoperations that could result in -

hazardous or undesirable conditions but at the same
time fulfull the foIlowmg requirements:

1. The level recorders and pilot devices in the fuel and

coolant pump systems must be switched from one
level transmitter signal to another

. 2. The ‘solenoid valves in the fuel and. coolant pump

- helium supply lines must be operated individually
- for testing purposes: the block valves must be closed

periodically for leak tests,-and the equalizing valves

must be opened periodically to demonstrate that the

dip tubes and associated lines are clear and function-
~ ing properly and that pressure changes in the dip

tubes will be sensed by the transmitters (see Sect.

3.1.2). Closing the equalizing valves also provides a

means- of checking the zero calibration of the
- differential pressure transmitters. = -~

3. The operations described in 1 and 2 above must be
conducted without disturbing the pilot devices or
the recorded signal. This is necessary to prevent

- spurious operations of the control interlocks which -

 result in undesirable and unnecessary shutdowns.

4. Output signals from the two level transmitters in the -

fuel pump overflow tank system cannot be switched
while the reactor is. in operation because they
~ actuate two separate sets of safety-grade pilot
~devices. The solenoid valves in the helium supply

- lines must be operated individually for testing

_purposes but only when the reactor is shut down.

Wlth SO many valves in each system, these require-

- ments present a complex operational problem, and the
probability of misoperations is high; therefore, the
“burden of coordinating valve operations is' removed
from the operator by using rotary-type position selector |
. switches to drive the contacts in each group of valve -

NOTES:

1. THESE SWITCH POSITIONS REPRESENT CONTROL ELEMENT CONDITIONS AS SHOW’N

IN THE DIAGRAMS, FIG.4.9.1.

2. PLACING THE TEST SWITCH IN THESE POSITIONS HAS NO EFFECT ON THE VALVES
WHEN THE CORRESPONDING SELECTOR SWITCH 1S IN POSITIONS OFF 3,44

(BUBBLER ¥2 IN SERVICE).

3. PLACING THE TEST SWITCH IN THESE POSITIONS HAS NO EFFECT ON THE VALVES
WHEN THE CORRESPONDING SELECTOR SWITCH IS IN POSITIONS OFF, 1,482

(BUBBLER *1 IN SERVICE).

4. THIS -SWITCH MUST NOT BE MOVED FROM THE “OFF “POSITION WHILE THE REACTOR
IS IN OPERATION. THE TWO LEVEL DETECTORS ON THE OVERFLOW TANK OPERATE
SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT INTERLOCKS IN THE SAFETY CIRCUITS AND THE
REACTOR WILL SHUT DOWN IF EITHER LEVEL DETECTOR IS TURNED YOFF”.

Two switches, one for selecting the mode of opera-

tion and one for conducting tests, are provided for each -

of the pump bowl level systems. The operational model

- selector switches, S36 and S39, are located in the main

control room on main boards MB816 and MB6! 7 along
with level recorders LR-593-C and LR-595C. No selec-

tor switch is provided for the overflow tank level

detectors since both must operate continuously while .
the reactor is in operation. The test switches $37, S40,

~and S38 for all three level systems are located in the

transmitter room on ‘transmitter boards TB51% and

TB6.1? Six level indicators, one connected to read the

output signal from each transmitter, are also mounted
on TB5.and TB6. '

The operation of the fuel pump system switches

‘shown in Table 4.9.1 is typical. Test switch S37 always

remains in the “off” position except for brief periods

when -tests are being conducted. When selector switch

S36 is in the “off” position, all three block valves are
closed, the two equalizer valves are open, and both level
detectors are off (zero output signat from LT-596B and
LT-593C). When the switch is moved to position 1, the
No. 1 and reference line block valves open, and the No.
1 equalizer valve closes to turn on level detector 1

(output signal from LT-596B increases with salt level).-
Level detector 2 remains off. When the switch is moved

to position 2, level detector 1 remains on, the No. 2
block valve opens, and the No. 2 equalizer valve closes

-
 

 

 

 

161

to turn on level detector 2 (output signals from both
LT-596B and LT-593C increase with salt level). Since
the three-way solenoid valve, HCV-593, is deenergized
when switch S36 is in positions “off,” “1,” and “2,”
the pilot devices and the level recorder LR-593C are all
connected to read the output signal from level detector

1 (LT-596B). When switch S36 is moved to position 3,

solenoid valve HCV-593C is energized, and the level
recorder connection is switched to read the output
signal from level detector 2 (LT-593C). Since the
output signals from the two detectors are equal, the
level recording, the pilot devices, and thus the control
circuit interlocks are not disturbed by the switching
operation. Switch position 4 reverses the control
element conditions described for position 1; that is,
level detector 2 remains on, and level detector 1 is
turned off. It is important to note that in every switch

position except “off,” at least one level detector is

turned on and is connected to the level recorder and the
control interlock pilot devices. Also, both detectors are
always tumed on when the level recorder and pilot
devices are switched from one to the other. These
features make the operation of the level systems nearly
foolproof as far as the operator is concerned.

The above description also applies to the operation of
the coolant pump selector switch S39 (Table 4.9.2).
S39 has one additional operating position, but other-
wise it is identical to switch $36. Position 3 on S39
energizes three-way solenoid valve HCV-598-C2 and
connects the level recorder LR-595C and the control
interlock pilot devices to the output signal from
float-type level transmitter LE-CP-A. Positions “‘off,” 1,
2, 4, and 5 on S39 correspond to positions “off,” 1, 2,
3, and 4 on switch S36.

Test switches 837 and S40 are identical, and both
remain in the “off” position unless the operator is
conducting leak tests on the helium system block and
equalizer valves. The valves can be tested individually
by moving the switches to other switch positions while
observing system pressures as described in Sect. 3.1.2.
Both switches are spring-loaded and return automati-
cally to the “off” position when released. The switches
may be rotated at will from one position to another
without upsetting the level recording orthe control
interlock pilot devices. The contacts are arranged so
that the test switches have no effect on the control
circuits of any valves associated with a level detector
that is connected to these devices. Tests can only be
performed on valves associated with the level detector
that is not connected to the pilot devices. Refer to
circuit 63, Fig. 4.1.5, for an illustration. All of the
solenoid valves in the dip tube helium lines open when

energized. When selector switch $36 is in position 1 or
2, level detector 1 is connected to the level recorder and
pilot devices. The No. 1 block valve HCV-593B1 is
energized through closed contacts S36A and S36B.
Contacts S36C and S36D are both open, and the No. 1
equalizer valve HCV-593BS is deenergized. Now, if test
switch 837 is turned to the “No. 1 block™ position,
contact S37A opens, but it obviously will have no
effect on the circuit. If the switch is turned further to
the “No. 1 equalizer” position, contact S37B closes but
does not affect the status of the circuit because
series-connected contact S$36D remains open. When
selector switch S36 is in position 3 or 4, level detector 2
is connected to the level recorder and pilot devices. The
No. 1 block valve HCV-593C1 is energized through
closed contacts S37A and S36A. The No. 1 equalizer
valve remains deenergized, but contact S36D closes.
Now, when the test switch 837 is turned to the “No. 1
block™ position, contact S37A opens and deenergizes
the No. 1 block valve. Turning the switch to the No. |
equalizer position closes contact S37B and energizes the
No. 1 equalizing valve. |

- Contacts on selector switches S36 and S39 also
control the operation of annunciator circuits 835 and
827 (Fig. 4.1.52). Pressure switches20:21 connected to
the helium supply lines operate the contacts in these
circuits to sound an alarm in the main control room if
the pressure in any line becomes too high or too low.
The selector switch prevents the alarm from sounding if
the flow of helium is stopped intentionally. If a selector
switch is turned to a position which closes one of the
dip tube line block valves (one level detector is
deliberately turned off), it also closes a contact in the
corresponding annunciator circuit. This contact by-
passes the two contacts operated by the pressure
switches connected to the same line. For example:
when switch S36 is in position 1, contact S36M is
closed, and contacts PS-593A1 and PS-593A2 cannot
affect the operation of annunciator circuit 835.

" 4.10 CONTROL INTERLOCK CIRCUITS

The contacts on the relays shown in Figs. 4.1.8 and
4.1.9 are connected in circuits which control valves,
motors, and other equipment in the reactor system.
Each relay performs one or more of the followmg
functions:

1. contact multiplication,

2. contact action reversal (normally open to normally
closed or vice versa),

3. isolation of circuits,

4. isolation of low-rated instrument contacts from high
currents and voltage spikes present in some circuits.

The relays are energized by the flow of current
through contacts on pilot devices which depend for
their operation on various physical effects in the
systems. The pilot devices are switches of special form

which are caused to function through pressure, tem- -

perature, vacuum, position, or some other physical
condition.. This condition is usually described on the
drawings by a short note adjacent to each contact
symbol. S

The function of each pilot devnce and relay combma-
tion is to control the operation of other equipment so
as to maintain some physical condition in a particular
system within certain predetermined limits.. Every
circuit shown is energized when the stated condition is
normal; when the condition is abrormal, or rather out
of limits, the switch opens and deenergizes the relay.
- Several additional pilot devices, one .for'_reacvh relay
contact, could have been used in place of the relays, but
it is much simpler to use one device to operate a relay
which has many separate contacts available for use in
other circuits. |

163

The circuits in Fig. 4.1.8 are all connected to one
control power bus, which is supplied by the 48-V dc
uninterruptable system. Those in Fig. 4.1.19 are ener-
gized by a single 110-V ac bus which is supplied by the
highly reliable 60-kW static inverter system.

4.11 JUMPER BOARD AND RELAY CABINETS
4.11.1 Jumper Board

System check-out and tests of various parts of the
reactor system, and the nonroutine operations required
to conduct experiments, inevitably create conflicts and
inconsistencies between operational requirements and
prohibitions 1mposed by the control and safety system.
Where such conflicts were foreseen and expected to
occur frequently, provisions were made in the design of
the control circuits for automatic bypassing with relay
contacts or for manual bypassing with contacts on
hand-operated switches. However, in an experimental
system such as the MSRE, the needs and requirements
for future bypassing of interlock contacts are not
always predictable, and, while it is conceivable that the
flexibility required to cover all possible contingencies
could be obtained with hand switches, the cost and
complexity of such a system would be prohibitive. It is
also possible (and common practice) to provide the
desired flexibility by using “clip leads” or wired
jumpers to bypass contacts when the need arises. This
method is not desirable because the point of installation
of the jumper is usually in an out-of-the-way place
behind panels, inside relay cabinets, or in field junction
boxes, where installation is difficult and easily for-
gotten.

To provide the desired flexibility for convement!y
bypassing interlock contacts and to avoid the problem
of the forgotten clip lead, a jumper board has been

installed in the MSRE. This jumper board, shown in

Fig. 4.11.1, is installed in the main control room and
presents a graphic display of the condition of the more
important electrical control circuitry as well as a means
of jumpering selected interlocks. Figures 4.11.2,4.11.3,
4.11.4, and 4.11.5 show the layouts of individual board
sections. ,Jumper positions are indicated by conc¢entric
circles. Lamps are indicated by circles. Lamps are on
when circuit continuity exists to the point at which the
lamp is attached. Jumpering is accomplished by in-
serting a plug into a jack (see below). Although not all
of the contacts shown on the jumper board are
provided with jumpers, the design of the jumper board
is such as to permit the addition of jumpers on any
contact shown on the jumper board.
 

 

 

 

Both control and safety circuit jumpering capability is
provided on the jumper board. The use of the jumper
board is subject to formal administrative control.
Jumpering of safety system circuitry requires the
approval of the department head and the chief or
assistant chief of reactor operations. Jumpering of
control-grade interlocks requires the same approval.

Installation of safety circuit jumpers will prevent, or
result in the cessation of, power operation of the
reactor (see below). |

The design of the jumper board and associated
circuitry fulfills design criteria, as follows:

1. Safety circuit isolation and separation are main-

tained.

. The jumpers (plugs) are readily visible to supervisory
and operations personnel in the main control area.

. The circuit and its condition (whether or not
energized) in each string of contacts is displayed to
personnel in the main control area by means of
indicating lamps.

. The presence of a safety system jumper is annunci-
ated.

. If any safety system contact is bypassed by a
jumper, the control system cannot be put in the
“operate” mode.

. Failures. of components in the jumper board .cir-
cuitry will not jeopardize operation of the safety
circuits.

Figure 4.11.6 is a diagram showing typical circuitry
required to jumper a safety system contact. Actual
contact bypassing is accomplished by relays which are
energized when plugs are inserted in the board. This
diagram is much simplified in that it shows only one
relay contact in the safety relay circuit. In an actual
circuit there are several contacts, all of which may be
wired for jumpers.

Criteria 1, 4, and 5 (above) are satisfied by contacts
on the bypassing relay (see Sect. 6.2.1.2).

In such a string of contacts with indicating lamps to
show contact condition, the remote possibility exists
that the lamps could bypass enough current around an
open contact to keep the safety relay operated. This
situation requires that the lamp neutral be open, so that
the current path through the lamps passes to neutral via
the safety relay. All safety-contact indicating lamp
circuits contain a dropping resistor and a silicon diode
in series with the lamp, so that normal current through
one lamp is much less than required to maintain the
safety relay operated. In the event of an open lamp

164

neutral, the diodes are back to back in the sneak circuit
through the safety relay. A typical silicon diode will
pass only a fraction of a milliampere of reverse current.
Since relay holding currents are over 100 mA, the relay
will not be prevented from dropping out.

Figure 4.11.7 is a diagram of a typical circuit required
to jumper a control system contact. In these circuits the
consequences of failures are much less severe than in
safety circuits, and there is no redundancy to protect.
The jumper is connected directly across the interlock,
and the silicon diodes and bypassing relay are elimi-
nated. The resistors in series with the lamps are,
however, retained to eliminate the possibility of short
circuits to ground through the lamps or lamp sockets.

To facilitate fabrication and to provide the capability
for future revisions, the MSRE jumper board uses
modular construction techniques. The board is com-
posed of a series of vertical strip assemblies mounted on
horizontal support strips and covered by plates which
are photoengraved to show the circuit schematic. Figure
4.11.8 shows the construction of a typical strip. The
front panel, rear panel jumper strip, and rear panel
terminal strip of all assemblies are drilled for the
maximum number of lamps and jumpers. Hardware and
wiring are, however, installed only where required
initially, and additions or revisions are made as the need
arises.

4.11.2 Relay Cabinets

With a few exceptions, all control and safety circuit
relays are located in cabinets in the auxiliary control
room. To maintain the required separation of control-
grade and safety-grade circuits, two cabinets are used.
One cabinet contains all the control circuit relays and is
designated as the control relay cabinet. The other
cabinet is designated as the safety relay cabinet and
contains only safety circuit relays. Physical separation is
also maintained between redundant safety channels
within the safety cabinets. ,

The relay cabinets also serve as central interconnec-
tion points for the main reactor control circuit wiring
(see Sect. 7.2). | |
- The physical construction of the control relay cabinet
is shown -in Fig. 4.11.9. Relays are mounted on both
sides of a Micarta board assembly as shown in Fig.
4.11.10. Relay contacts and operating coils are wired
directly to plug-in-type terminal blocks* mounted
alongside the relays. The terminal block assemblies also

serve as interconnection strips. Interconnection wiring

is run in troughs between and behind the relays. Figure
4.11.11 is a photograph of one side of the control relay
board. This photograph was taken during construction
and does not show the full complement of relays or the
external interconnection wiring. Part of the internal

- interconnections were installed when the photograph

was taken and can be seen in the photograph. The
physical construction of the safety relay cabinet, shown
in Fig. 4.11.13, is similar to that of the control relay
cabinet. Figure 4.11.12 is a photograph of one side of
the safety relay board. This photograph was also taken
during construction and does not show the full com-
plement of relays or the external interconnection
wiring. The safety relay-cabinet differs from the control
relay cabinet as follows: :

1. It is smaller in size,

2. Barrier-type screw terminal blocks are used mstead
of plug-in terminal blocks.

3. All interface interconnections are made through
terminals at the sides of the cabinet. |

4. The board is physically divided to provide separation
of redundant channels 1, 2, and 3. '

Barrier-type screw terminals were used in the safety
cabinet because, at the time the cabinet was designed,
there was insufficient experience at ORNL with the
more compact and flexible plug-in terminals to satlsfy
the safety system reliability requirements.

The side terminal strips provided a convenient means
of connecting external interconnection wiring and
ensured that the required separation of wiring of
redundant safety channels (and of control- and safety-
grade wiring) would not be inadvertently compromised
during field installation by misrouting of external
interconnection wiring. The side strips also provided

 additional terminals for internal interconnections.

The required separation of redundant channels 1 and
2 is obtained by mounting relays assoclated with these
channels on opposite sides of the board. Channel 3 is
separated from channels 1 and 2 by mounting the
channel 3 relay in a vertical row? at one side of the
board and providing a metallic separator between the
area assigned to channel 3 and the area assigned to
channels 1 and 2. - L

_All external interconnection wmng in both cabmets

enters the cabinets fror_n below. Control-grade wiring is -
run in trays below the cabinets. Safety-grade wiring is

run in separate conduits (see Sect. 7.2).

 

TRight side in Fig. 4.11.12; left side on opposite side of the
board.

Except for the inevitable cross-connections required
for matrices, all wiring associated with a given safety
channel is contained in the space allocated to that
channel. Cross-connections between safety channels
(required for matrices) are routed in the shortest path
possible (usually through the board), so that any
possibility of a short circuit to a third channel or to
control-grade wiring is eliminated. Due to a shortage of
space, much of the internal interconnection wiring in
the safety cabinet is routed through conduits across the
top of the cabinet.

With a few exceptions, all relays are General Electric
type CR-120. This relay is available w1th either ac or dc
coils, and both are used. The basic relay has four
double-break contacts, which ‘may be either normally
open or nommally closed. On dc relays, one of the
contacts is used to operate the relay, and only three are

-available. Contacts are easily removed in the field for

service or inspection and are field reversible. The
number of contacts may be increased at any time to six
or eight by installing contact adder blocks. These relay
features and the general design of the relay cabinets
provide a flexibility which permits expansion and
revision of circuitry with a minimum of effort.

4.12 ANNUNCIATORS
4.12.1 Introduction

Chapters 2 and 3 of this report describe the many nu-
clear and process measuring loops utilized in the MSRE.
Signals generated by these loops operate recorders and
indicators to provide a continuous display of the plant
operating conditions. These same signals also activate
the annunciator system to alert the operator when any
measurement exceeds a predetermined limit. Many
control and safety circuit relay operations, manual as
well as automatic, which are described in other sections
of Chap. 4, are also annunciated. When an’off-ljmits
condition or circuit operation occurs, thg‘;annunciator
produces an audible and visual alarm which the oper-
ator must recognize by pressing a. push button on the

" main control board. This is the only way. ‘the audible

alarm can be silenced. In many instances the alarm is an
advance warning that, if the trend of the measured
variable is allowed to continue, control or safety system
interlocks will be actuated to change the operating
status of the plant. Usually the operator will have time
to reverse the trend or take some other positive action

“before the interlocks actually operate.

Most of the annunciator units are mounted on top of
the instrument panels in the main' and auxiliary’
 

 

 

control rooms (see Fig. 1.3.2), but a few are located on
field panels for auxiliary systems such as the fuel
processing system,® the fuel sampler-enricher system,*
the temperature scanner system,® and the reactor cell
vapor suppression system (see ORNL-TM-729,2° Fig.
1.3.1). Another group of annunciator units is mounted
in the face of auxiliary boards AB3® and AB4.”

4.12.2 Component Description

Four different types of annunciator chassis are used
in the MSRE system. They are the Tigerman Engineer-
ing Company model 440TL Tel-Alarm, the Panellit
Corporation series 51 Panalarm, the Rochester Instru-
ment Company model SM-110 (modified), and the
Electra Systems Corporation Operations Monitor Sys-
tem.

The Tel-Alarm chassis shown in Fig. 4.12.1a are used
on all 12 of the main board panels and on all of the
field panels except those for the vapor suppression
system. The unit has six visual elements with individual
back-lighted turret-type lenses. The top half of each
lens is red, the bottom half is white. The variable being
monitored is identified by an engraved Lamacoid tag
under each lens. The lamps in each element as well as
the audible alarm are controlled by a model 416NCL
plug-in relay unit. A typical relay circuit for a single
annunciator point in a Tel-Alarm chassis is shown in
Fig. 4.12.2.

When operating conditions are normal, the field
contact in Fig. 4.12.2 is closed, and the lamps, both red
and white, are dimly lit. If the operating condition
becomes abnormal (off limits), the field contact opens
to operate the relays, the red and the white lamps burn
brightly, and the R bus is energized to sound an audible
alarm. The operator must acknowledge the abnormal
condition by momentarily opening the “‘acknowledge”
push-button switch. When this switch opens, the audi-
ble alarm is turned off, and the white light on the lower
half of the turret lens goes out. The annunciator will
hold this condition as long as the field contact remains
open. Once this contact closes, the annunciator may be
returned to the normal operating condition by momen-
tarily opening the *“reset” push button. The complete
operating sequence is tabulated in Fig. 4.12.2. Refer to
specification MSRE-1762 for further details.

The Panalarm series 51 chassis shown in Fig. 4.12.1b
is used on the auxiliary boards and the nuclear boards
in the auxiliary control room. This chassis is very
similar to the one just described, but there are some
significant differences. Each chassis has only five visual

166

elements with individual flush-mounted rectangular-
shaped plastic lenses. Each lens is all white and is
engraved with black letters which identify the moni-
tored variable. The lamp in each element and the
audible alarm are controlled by a model 50 NC plug-in
relay unit. A typical relay circuit for a single annunci-

ator point is shown in Fig. 4.12.3. The field contact, -

operated by a relay or a process variable, is closed for
normal operating conditions, the lamp is out, and the
audible alarm is silent. When operating conditions
become abnormal (off limits), the contact opens, the
audible alarm sounds, and the lamp for that unit only
comes on flashing. The flashing light is controlled by
the flasher motor, which is a plug-in unit the same as
the alarm relay. Each five-point chassis has one flasher
motor. To silence the audible alarm, the operator must
acknowledge the abnormal condition by momentarily
opening the “acknowledge” push button. This also
stops the flasher motor, but the lamp will continue to
burn bright and steady as long as the field contact
remains open. There is no reset feature on this type of
unit, and the lamp will go out automatically when
conditions return to normal and the field contact closes
again. All lamps connected to the C bus may be tested
by opening the *“lamp test” push button. When the
push-button switch is open, the lamps should burn
brightly. If any do not, the lamp bulbs need to be
replaced. The complete operating sequence is tabulated
in Fig. 4.12.3. Refer to specification MSRE-174° for
further details.

The Rochester model SM-110 (modified) chassis
(refer to specification MSRE-175)'? are all mounted in
the face of auxiliary boards AB3® and AB4.” This type
of chassis is entirely different from the two previously
described. Each chassis contains only two independent
alarm points, but the units are much smaller, and six
chassis containing 12 alarm elements will fit into a
single 6% X 24 in. panel as shown in Fig. 4.12.4.
Twenty-four chassis containing 48 alarm elements are
mounted in AB3. Eighteen chassis containing 36 alarm
elements are mounted in auxiliary board AB4.

Two toggle switches and two lamps, one set for each

alarm element, are mounted in the face of each chassis.

The variable being monitored is identified by an
engraved Lamacoid tag mounted under each lamp-
switch combination. The lamps are controlled by
separate relay circuits which require a 28-V dc power
source as shown in Fig. 4.12.5. Power is furnished by
two supplies; one is manufactured by the Rochester
Company and the other is an ORNL model
Q-880-59.'! The 24 chassis mounted in AB3 are

C\

connected in parallel to one power supply, and the 18
chassis mounted in AB4 are connected to the other.
The operation of the circuit controlling lamp LI
and relay K1 is typical since the two circuits shown
in Fig. 4.12.5 are identical. Switch S1 has three
positions — “operate,” “reset,” and “disable.” With
the circuit as shown, S1 is in the “operate” posi-
tion, the power supply is on, but lamp L1 and
relay K1 are both deenergized. The condition of
the process variable is normal (not out of limits);
therefore the field contact is closed. The circuit is
placed in its normal operating mode by moving the
switch to the “reset” position momentarily and then
returning jt to the “operate” position. In the “reset”
position the S1 contact closes, and normally open
contact K1A is bypassed. This connects lamp L1 and
relay K1 to the 28-V dc power bus. Relay K 1 energizes,
and contacts K1A and K1B close. When S1 is returned
to the “operate” position, lamp L1 and relay K1 both
remain energized by the flow of current through the
field contact and the seal-in contact K1A. The lamp L1
burns brightly. Contact K1B is connected in series with
similar contacts in other Rochester units, and the series
circuit thus formed is used to control an annunciator
element on the main board. This feature will be
described in greater detail in the following section.
_ If the process variable becomes abnormal, the field
contact opens. This deenergizes lamp L1 and relay K1,
the lamp goes out, contacts K1A and K1B open, and
the alarm sounds. The operator now has two choices.
First, switch S1 is placed in the “reset” position, and if
the field contact has retumed to the closed position,
the circuit elements will return to their normal oper-
ating condition in the manner just described. On the
other hand, if the field contact does not return
immediately to the closed position, the circuit will not
reset, and the operator may choose to disable it, that is,
prevent further anriunciations. The circuit is disabled by
placing switch S1 in the “disable” position. With the

switch in this position, both the relay K1 and the lamp

L1 are energized by the flow of current from terminal 5
through resistor R5, and the relay. will remain energized
regardless of the condition of the field contact. As long
as the field contact remains open, lamp L1 burns dimly,
but when it closes, lamp L1 will burn bnghtly, and

~ switch 81 may be retumed to the ‘operate” position

for normal operation. This feature is rtisé(d to good
advantage with field contacts operated by process

variables which have no immediate effect on the

operating COHdltlon of the reactor and allow the
operator some time to investigate the cause of the
abnormal condition. The complete sequence of opera-

167

tions for all conditions is described by the tabulation in
Fig. 4.12.5.

The Electra Systems Corporation Operatlons Monitor
System?® is described in Sect. 6.15 of this report. A
system consists of ten temperature-operated switch
modules mounted in a single enclosure plus a power
supply unit which provides power and a reset function
to the switch modules. A typical system is shown in
Fig. 6.15.1. The reset function is either manual or
automatic. When the auto-manual reset switch on the
front panel of the power supply is in the “auto”
position, the system will be automatically subjected to
the reset function whenever any module goes into the
alarm condition. Reset occurs at approximately 5-sec
intervals until either the out-of-limit condition is
corrected or the auto-manual reset switch is tumed to
the “manual” position. When the switch is in the
“manual” position, the system is subjected to the reset
function only when the “reset” push button is de-
pressed. Ten complete systems, TX-3001 through
TX-3010 (see ORNL specifications MSRE-103,'”
MSRE-104,'® and MSRE-108'°), are used in the
MSRE. All ten systems are mounted in auxiliary
panelboards ABS'* and AB6.'%

Two types of switch modules are used in the MSRE
temperature monitoring system. One type is the model
FT-4200 alarm module shown in Fig. 6.15.3. The other
type is the model ET-4300 control module shown in
Fig. 6.15.4. The major difference between the two
types is that the control module does not depend on
the reset function but operates in a manner similar to
an on-off controller; that is, the switch contacts
alternately open and close automatically as the input
signal crosses the control set point. On the other hand,
when the alarm module input signal is off limits, the

-switch contacts open and remain open until the

off-limit condition is corrected and the module is reset
either manually or automatically. The two types are
used interchangeably in any of the ten enclosures.

- The output from each module is used'-'to_ operate a
relay which serves as an interface between the module
and external circuits, The relays ‘are mounted in the
same enclosure as the switch modules, and their coils
are energized when the temperatures bemg monitored
are within preset limits and are deenergized when the
limits are exceeded. The mercury-wetted relay contacts
are connected to operate annunciator and control
circuits.

A lamp on the front panel of each switch module
glows dimly when the system is operating properly and
the input signal is within the preset limits. When the
signal is out of limits, the lamp glows at full brilliance.
 

 

A metal tag embossed with the switch identification
number is attached to the front panel of each module.

The power supplies for two of the operations monitor
systems, TX-3001 and TX-3003, are equipped with an
additional feature called the master alarm. The master
alarm is a common alarm for all alarm modules in a
single system. (The model ET-4300 control modules do
not activate the master alarm.) Red and amber-colored
lamps mounted on the front of each of the two power
supply panels indicate the existence of high and/or low
alarm conditions. The lamps glow dimly when all
channels are in the normal condition and bumn at full
brilliance when any one or more of the modules is out
of limits. The master alarm circuity also produces an
output voltage (18 V at 100 mA dc) which is used to
operate an external relay. Contacts on the two relays,
labeled TX-3001 and TX-3003 in Fig. 6.15.6, are used
to actuate main board annunciator elements. This
operation is described further in Sect. 4.12.3.

Monitor systems TX-3002 and TX-3004 through
TX-3010 are all operated in the automatic reset mode.
Most of the switch elements are model ET-4300 control
modules®® which are used as automatic control inter-
locks in the freeze valve control circuits (see Sect. 4.3),
A few, some of which are connected directly to main
board annunciator elements (see circuits 892 and 893,
Fig. 4.1.52), are model ET-4200 alarm modules,' 7 but
they open and close automatically the same as any
other process instrument switch. None of the above
systems or groups of modules are connected to operate
a common alarm in the main and auxiliary control
rooms,

4.12.3 System Description and Operating
Characteristics

The MSRE annunciator system is designed so that
every open field contact ultimately produces an audible
and visual alam in the main control room which the
operator is required to acknowledge. Since there are
approximately 265 individual annunciator points in the
system, the operator could be overwhelmed by sheer
numbers; therefore the annunciator arrangement used
minimizes the number of points actually located in the
main control room and presents information in a
manner that enables the operator to quickly identify
the process variable that is producing the alarm. The
annunciator system and its operating characteristics are
illustrated by the simplified wiring diagram shown in
Fig. 4.12.6. '

The field contacts that initiate the alarms fall into
two general categories: one is comprised of those

168

contacts connected directly to annunciator elements
located in the main control room, and the other is
comprised of those connected to annunciator elements
located on auxiliary panels. The operation of contacts
in the first category generally alerts the operator when
abnormal conditions develop in those systems which
exert a direct and immediate influence on the operating
state of the reactor. Usually the operator must act
immediately to correct the condition if normal opera-
tion is to be maintained. There are about 84 annunci-
ator elements located on the main board. Sixty-six fall
into the first category. The remaining 18 elements
simply direct the Oparator to 18 groups of annunciator
elements in the second category. There are approxi-
mately 181 individual annunciator elements operated
by field contacts in this second category.

Temperature switch TS-OFT-6A and relay contact
K22A, both connected to main board annunciator
chassis XA-4013, as shown in Fig. 4.12.6, are typical
examples of alarm contacts in the first category. When

‘the pressure in the fuel pump bowl exceeds 25 psig,
‘relay K22 deenergizes, and contact K22A opens circuit

1092 (see Fig. 4.1.58). The red-and-white turret lens in
the Tigerman annunciator element lights up on the
main board, and the audible alarm connected to the R
bus at XA-4000 sounds. The operator must open the
“acknowledge” push button to silence the audible
alarm. The R buses of all annunciator chassis mounted
on the main board are connected together and act asa
single unit to operate one audible alarm. The same is
true for the “acknowledge™ and “‘reset” push buttons
connected to the common C buses and K buses
respectively. Figures 4.1.52 and 4.1.58 are elementary
wiring diagrams of all field contacts connected directly
to main board annunciators.

Contacts K1060A, K1074A, and K1036A, all con-
nected as shown in Fig. 4.12.6 to separate elements in
main board annunciator chassis XA-4010, are typical
examples of alarm contacts in the second category.
When one of these contacts opens to activate a single
annunciator element on the main board, the operator is
directed to a particular group of annunciator elements
located in the auxiliary control room or on a field
panel. For example, assume that relay contact K1060A
opens circuit 855 and activates the main board annunci-
ator. This informs the operator that one of the process
radiation monitors is indicating high activity and also
directs him to the group of annunciator elements in
chassis XA-4042 and XA-4043, which are mounted on
nuclear boards NB3 and NB4 in the auxiliary control
room. At this point the operator presses the
“acknowledge” push button located on the. console
 

 

e T

 

169

(MB13)!? to silence the main board audible element
and proceeds to the auxiliary control room to obtain
more specific information. The audible alarm energized

‘by the annunciators in the auxiliary control room (see

circuit 917, Fig. 4.12.6) continues to sound. A'glance
at NB3 and NB4 reveals a flashing light behind
one of the lenses in chassis XA-4042 and XA-4043.

In this case assume that it is element 1 in chassis

XA-4042 (see circuit 1055). This tells thé operator
that * high radioactivity exists in .the main cooling

- water return line 827 at the point where three

identical radiation detectors RE-927A, B, and C are
located (see Fig. 3.8.0). Another glance at the lamps

‘and indicators on the three radiation monitors

RM-827A, B, and C, mounted in NB3 will enable the
operator to identify the one or more elements trans-
mitting the out-oflimits radiation signal. Once the
source of the alarm is identified, the operator presses
the annunciator “acknowledge™ push button mounted
in auxiliary board AB1'3 to deenergize circuit 917 and
silence the audible element. The lamp in element 1 of
chassis XA-4042 will stop flashing but will continue to

‘burn brightly until all ﬁeld contacts in cifcuit 1055

close again.

Two types of process radiation monitors '_opérate
annunciator field contacts. One is an ORNL Q-1916
logarithmic response gamma radiation monitor'* and

"the other is an E-H Research Laboratones model 202
;electrometer

A meter on the front panel of the model Q-1916

“indicates the level of radiation, and to the right of the

meter a neon lamp bums brightly when the alarm
set-point level is exceeded. Relay contacts. in the
monitor are used in annunciator and control circuits.
The relay coil is energized during normal in-limit
operation, and the contacts are closed, but it deener-
gizes and opens the contacts when the radiation level
exceeds the preset limits. The relay automatically resets

and closes the contacts again when the radiation level -
~ returns to normal. The annunciator points actuated by
-contacts in the model Q-1916 monitor cannot be

returned to the normal ‘opérating condltnon untll the
relay resets.

A meter-re]ay unit on the front panel of the model
202 electrometer not -only indicates  the level of

radiation measured but also has an adjustable high-limit |

set point that controls an auxiliary relay. circuit.
Contacts on the relay are used in the annunciator and

control circuits. The relay is' energized during normal -

inJimit operation but deenergizes when the' radiation
level exceeds the preset limit and opens the contacts
used in the annunciator and control -circuits. The

contacts will remain open and maintain the alarm

condition on the annunciator until the radiation level
returns to normal and the operator presses the “reset”
push button on the front panel of the electrometer.
Radiation monitors RM-827A, B and C are model 202
electrometers.

All annunciator elements in the chassis that have their
R buses connected together form a single group. For
instance, the R terminals on the two chassis mentioned
above, XA-4042 and XA-4043, are interconnected;
therefore ‘all ten elements in these two chassis form a
single group. Relay K1060 is connected to this common
R bus-and the neutral bus as shown in Fig. 4.12.6. If
any one ‘of the ten elements in the two chassis is
activated by an open field contact, the R bus and relay

'K1060 are energized. Contact K1060A opens in circuit
855 to activate the main board annunciator, and at the

same time contact K1060B closes in circuit 917 to
energize the audible alarm element in the auxiliary
control room. Relay K1074 operates in the same
manner to produee¢ an alarm on the main board when
any one of the group of 15 elements in chassis
XA-4020, XA4021, and XA-4022 is activated by an
open field contact. The same applies to relay K1036,
which is energized by one of the group of six elements
in chassis XA-4053 ' mounted on the temperature
scanner panel- TSP1.* Each group of annunciators
located on field-mounted panelboards is equipped with
an audible alarm, a “reset” push button, and an
“acknowledge” push button. These are also shown in
Fig. 4.12.6. Figures 4.1.53 and 4.1.47 are elementary
wiring - diagrams of all - field' contacts connected to
annunciator elements mounted on top of the auxiliary
and nuclear panelboards. Figures 4.1.56, 4.1.59,
3.12.1K, and 3.13.5 are elementary wiring diagrams of
all ‘field contacts connected to chassis located on
field-mounted panelboards. :

The annunciator field contacts connected to the
Rochester Instrument Company chassis in auxiliary
boards AB3 and AB4 also fall into the second category;
that is,- the information conveyed must be acknowl-
edged immediately, but the condition probably will not
require immediate corrective actions. There are 84

_individual annunciator elements in the Rochester sys-

tem. These are divided into six groups as shown in Fig.
4.12.6. Each group is connected to a single alarm
element .on the main board, and this element is
activated if one or more of the Rochester elements in

‘the group is in the alarm mode.:It: was previously

explained in Sect. 4.12.2 that each Rochester annunci-
ator element operates an auxiliary relay contact that is
connected to a main board annunciator. The connec-
 

 

 

 

170

tion is illustrated by the wiring diagram for chassis
XA-4026 and XA-4027 in Fig. 4.12.6. The auxiliary
contacts in each of the elements in this group are
connected in series, and this series circuit is connected
to element 3 (circuit 862) in main board annunciator
chassis XA-4000. Both the field contacts and the
auxiliary relay contacts in the Rochester elements
remain closed if operating conditions are normal. If one
field contact in the group opens, the corresponding
auxiliary relay contact in the series string also opens,
and the main board annunciator is activated. As in
previous examples, the operator presses the main board
“acknowledge™ push button to silence the audible
element. The operator then proceeds to auxiliary
boards AB3 and AB4 and glances at chassis XA-4026
and XA-4027. Any element with a dark lamp and
switch S1 in the “operate™ position is in the “alarm”
condition. After the element causing the alarm is
identified, the operator moves switch S1 to the “reset”
position momentarily and then returns it to the
“operate” position. If the field contact has returned to
the normal operating position (closed), the lamp will
bumn brightly to signify that the element is again in the
normal operating mode; if not, the lamp remains dark,
and the operator may choose to place switch Sl in the
*“disable” ‘position. When switch S1 is in the “disable”
position, the auxiliary relay contact in the Rochester
element closes, and the lamp bumns dimly as described
previously in Sect. 4.12.2. The Rochester element is
now inoperative, but the continuity of the series string
of contacts connected to the main board annunciator is
maintained, and the other Rochester elements in the
group remain in service. The ability to maintain the
continuity of the series circuit, even when one or more
annunciator elements are disabled, is the main ad-
vantage gained by using the Rochester-type elements.
The lamp-switch combination, mounted on the auxil-
iary boards in plain view of the operator, also serves as a
constant reminder that one or more annunciator ele-
ments are out of service. |

Figures 4.1.54 and 4.1.55 are elementary wiring
diagrams of all field contacts connected to the
Rochester-type annunciator chassis.

Thermocouples connected to alarm modules in the
Electra Systems Corporation temperature monitor
TX-3001'7 transmit signals proportional to tempera-
tures at the freeze flanges and the reactor access nozzle.
Thermocouples connected to the two alarm modules in
temperature monitor TX-3003!7 transmit signals that
are proportional to temperatures at the radiator annulus
ducts. If any temperature signal to either of the two
monitors exceeds the preset limits, the module will

switch to the “alarm’ state, the lamp in the front panel
of the module will glow at full brilliance, and the
master alarm in the system containing the module will
energize one of the external relays, TX-3001 or
TX-3003. The two relays are connected to the power
supply units as shown in the extreme right of Fig.
4.12.6. For example, assume that one of the tempera-
ture signals from the radiator annulus duct is out of
limits and alarm module TS-AD3-5B switches to the
“alarm™ state. The lamp in module TS-AD3-5B will
glow at full brilliance, and relay TX-3003 will be
energized. The contact operated by TX-3003 is con-
nected to main control board annunciator circuit 857 as

‘shown in the left-hand portion of Fig. 4.12.6. The

contact opens and activates the main board annunci-
ator. When this occurs, the operator silences the main
board audible alarm and proceeds to auxiliary board
ABS5, where he observes two lamps — a bright red
and/or bright amber-colored lamp on the front panel of
power supply unit TX-3003. The lamp in module
TS-AD3-5B, which is beneath the power supply unit,
will also be burning brightly. If the automatic-manual
reset switch is in the *‘auto” position, the module will
automatically return to the normal state when the
input signal returns to normal. If the switch is in the
“manual” position, the operator must wait until the
lamp in the module goes dim and then press the “reset”
push button to return the module to the normal
operating state. '

The modules and the relays connected to TX-3003
operate in an identical manner to actuate main board
annunciator circuit 857. | '

4.13 INSTRUMENT POWER DISTRIBUTION
4.13.1 General Description -

Electrical power is distributed to the MSRE instru-
ments and control circuits through seven circuit-
breaker-type distribution panels as. shown by the

“simplified one-line diagram of Fig. 4.13.1. The panels

are divided into three groups, and each group receives

171

power from one of three practically independent:

sources within the distribution system. These three
sources are identified as follows: :

1. Reliable ac system.
2. TVA-diesel system.
3. 48-V dc system.

All 'three ‘sources are designed to operate continuously

- for long periods with a high degree of reliability and

little attention. For normal operating conditions the
three sources are supplied from the Tennessee Valley
Authority (TVA) system, but two of them, the reliable
ac source and the 48-V dc source, are not totally
dependent on this system, and their output to the

instruments and control circuits will continue uninter-
rupted when the TVA system supply fails. ’

The need for a highly reliable, uninterrupted supply
of instrument system power is dictated by the philoso-
phy governing the operation of the reactor and the
design of the control and safety circuits. A compre-
hensive discussion of this philosophy is given in
ORNL-TM-729, Part IIA.7 In general, the philosophy
provides a strong incentive to maintain continuous
operation at.the MSRE; therefore, the plant and the
instrumentation and control system are designed to
minimize unscheduled shutdowns caused by equipment
failures and electrical power (TVA) interruptions. Such
interruptions are a leading cause of plant shutdowns,
and the design of the MSRE assumes that TVA-supplied
electrical power will be interrupted several times a year
by thunderstorms alone.

If the reactor is operating at full power when a TVA
system outage occurs, the rods and the load are
scrammed, but total shutdown, which is defined to
mean a reactor drain, is not immediate. Freeze valve
FV103 in line 103 begins to thaw because the compo-
nent cooling air blowers are out of service, but about 10
min is required for the valve to thaw. The normal
procedure following a loss of TVA power is to obtain
emergency power by starting the diesel generators.
Once the generators are in operation, the supply of
cooling air for FV103 can be restored before it thaws
completely, criticality can also be restored, and the
reactor can then operate at the heat loss power level
indefinitely until TVA power is again available.

The control circuits, safety circuits, and instrument
systems operate to produce shutdown conditions when
deenergized, even momentarily. Therefore, it should be
obvious that the above procedure would be impossible
unless the supply of power to essential plant controls
and instruments is maintained when TVA outages
occur. Other advantages are gained by having high-
quality independent power sources which serve instru-
ment and control circuit loads only. Most instruments
perform better when the applied ac voltage wave is
sinusoidal and has a constant amplitude. The output
from the dc supplies is very stable — another require-
ment for good performance. Independent power
sources are also free from transients with voltage spikes
and dips. When present, these effects can cause spurious
ope'ratlons in the instruments and control circuits which
lead to undesirable interruptions in the normal oper-
ation of the reactor system.

The TVA distribution system and assocnated equip-
ment are described in ORNL-TM-728, Part 1.!? The rest
of this section describes the systems that supply
 

 

172

electrical power to the instruments and control circuits.

4.13.2 Reliable AC System

4.13.2.1 Power supply equipment. Instrument power
distribution panels IPP2, IPP3, IPPA3, and IPPAG are
normally energized by the reliable ac power supply as
shown in Fig. 4.13.1. The panels can be supplied from
either one of two sources, the 62.5-kVA static inverter
or TVA motor control centers 3 and 4, depending on
the positions of automatic transfer switches 1 and 2.
Normally the panels are connected to the static
inverter, but if the output from that source fails, switch
"1 automatically transfers the connection to the motor
control centers through transfer switch 2. Transfer
switch 2 normally connects the panels to motor center
4, but if motor control center 4 deenergizes, the switch
automatically transfers the connection to motor control
center 3. Such transfer operations are not expected to
occur very often, but when they do occur, the
switching operation will cause a momentary power
interruption. Some control circuits will undoubtedly
deenergize and perturb the operation of the reactor, but
the quick restoration of power (the switching operation
is completed in Y% to % sec) to vital instruments and
controls will minimize the perturbation and perhaps
enable the operator to restore normal operating con-
ditions for a reasonable time at least.

The static inverter, manufactured by the Westing-
house Electric Corporation,! has a full load capacity of
62.5 kVA. It is constructed entirely of solid state
components which have no moving parts and is con-
sidered to be a highly reliable device. It requires a
250-V dc supply and has a three-phase, four-wire
output circuit configuration. This configuration pro-
vides 120-V single-phase ac and 208-V three-phase ac
outputs at a frequency of 60 Hz t 0.1%. The output
voltage regulation is 1% from no load to full load.

The input terminals of the static inverter are con-
nected to the 250-V dc distribution panel, which is
energized by the 125-kW motor-generator set No. 1 and
a battery. When the TVA main distribution bus is
energized, the 250-V dc panel is supplied by the motor
generator. The battery remains connected to the panel
at all times and is kept fully charged by the generator
output. If the output from the generator is lost because
of a TVA power failure or for any other reason, the
battery will continue to supply power to the 250-V dc
panel and the static inverter without interruption for at
least 2 hr. A complete description of motor-generator
set No. 1, the battery, and associated equipment is
given in ORNL-TM-728, Part 1.'° The location of the

major components in both the 250-V and the 48-V dc
systems is shown on drawing D-KK-C-55106.2 The
48-V dc system is described later in this section.

Audible and visual alarms sound in the auxiliary and
main control rooms if any one of the following
conditions develops: '

1. Malfunction of components in 62.5-kVA static
inverter! (see circuit 900, Fig. 4.1.53).

2. Generator No. 1 (250-V dc) load circuit breaker
open (see circuit 899, Fig. 4.1.53). '

3. Low output voltage from 62.5-kVA static inverter
(see circuit 896, Fig. 4.1.53).

'4.13.2.2 Distribution panels and circuits. Instrument
power distribution panels IPP2, IPP3, and IPPA3 are
mounted on the south wall of the auxiliary control
room, which is near the locations of most of the

instruments and control circuits and is within easy

reach of the operators and maintenance personnel. The
panels are constructed with two 100-A main buses and
a solid neutral bus which is grounded. They are
designed for use on 120/240-V single-phase distribution
systems. Each panel has space for 20 single-pole circuit
breaker elements. Wiring diagrams for all of the
instrument power distribution panels are listed in ref. 3.
The loads — such as instrument components, relay
circuits, and valve circuits — served by each circuit
breaker in each panel are identified in Figs. 4.13.2 and
4.133° |

IPP2. Except for the channel 1 safety-grade input
circuits, panel IPP2 supplies power to control-grade
circuits for equipment that is essential to normal
reactor operations. This equipment includes freeze
valves, rod drive controls, load controls, and others as
listed in Table 4.13.1. The distribution of power to
these circuits is straightforward and requires no further
explanation here. The term “channel 1 safety circuits”
refers to one of the three redundant input signal relay
circuits employed extensively in the design of the plant

safety system. The plant safety system and a typical

example of three-channel redundant design are dis-
cussed in ORNL-TM-729, Part IIA.'*® Other examples,
shown in Figs. 4.7.2.2 and 4.8.3, are described in this
report, Sects. 4.7.2.2 and 4.8.3. In these examples, each
of the three input relay circuits is energized from a
separate power source. Since any two of the three
relays must deenergize to activate the safety system, the
use of redundant power sources enhances the reliability
of the two-of-three configuration; that is, the loss of a

" single power source will not activate the safety system.

Channel 2 safety circuits are energized from the

TVA-diesel system through IPP4, while the channel 3
safety circuits are supplied from the 48-V dc system
through IPP1.

It is important to note at this point that the channel 1
safety relay circuits and the channel 1 safety-grade
instrument components, whose contacts operate in the
channel 1 relay circuits, are both supplied from the
same instrument power source — the reliable ac system.
These components are supplied through circuit breaker
10 in IPP3. The same arrangement is used in the
channel 2 and channel 3 safety systems.

173

the ECI switch components which receive their power
from circuits 3 and 4 in IPPA3. Contacts operated by
these switch components are used as interlocks in the
channel 1 safety circuits. If the output of the power
supplies should fall below 60 V dc, the measurement of
conditions in the reactor system would be in error, and
the operating set points of the switches would shift to
unknown values. This condition may not be apparent to
the operator and could lead to serious consequences.
Such a condition is prevented by the undervoltage
relays (UVR). If the power supply output falls below

. 60 V dc, the relays deenergize, their contacts open, and

'IPP3 and IPPA3. A glance at Fig. 4.13.2 will show

that the majority of all instrument components, both
safety and control grahe receive power from instru-
ment power panel IPP3. The notable exceptxons are the
two groups of instruments associated with safety
system channels 2 and 3, which are connected to
instrtument power panels IPP4 and IPPAL.

The undervoltage relays UVR2 through UVRé ﬁfe a

special feature of circuit 10 in IPP3. Circuit 10 is the

the Foxboro switch components are deenergized. All
contacts operated by these components open and
deenergize the safety circuits in which they are con-
nected. All safety circuits produce safe conditions when
deenergized. The undervoltage relays will not energize
again until a minimum of 60 V dc is applied. An
identical relay, UVRI, is applied in the same way in
circuit 3 of IPP4, which supplies power to instrument
components in safety channel 2.

IPP6. 1PP6 is a three-phase, four-wire circuit-breaker-
type distribution panel that serves both 120-V single-
phase and 208-V three-phase loads as required by the
computer data logger system. These loads are shown on
Fig. 4.13.3. The panel is nommally supplied from the
62.5-,kVA static inverter through a manual transfer
switch as shown in Fig. 4.13.1, but if necessary, the
connection can be transferred to the TVA-diesel instru-
ment power source. Panel {PP6 and the transfer switch
are both mounted on the north wall of the data room.

4.13.3 TVA-Diesel System

4.13.3.1 Power supply equipment. Instrument power
distribution ‘panels IPP4, IPPA4, [PPS, and [PP7 are
connected directly to the TVA system through diesel
generator buses 3 and 4 as shown in Fig. 4.13.1. This
system is not served by a battery-powered auxiliary

~ source, and the supply of power to all of the panels will

input to a power supply with five 65-V dc output

circuits. The 65-V dc circuits are power supphes for the

Foxboro Instrument Company ECI components (see

Sect. 5.2:2) used in safety system channel 1. These
measuring components produce the signals that operate

be interrupted for a short time if a TVA outage occurs.
Diesel generators 3 and 4 are available for standby
service, but 5 to 10 min is required to get them in
operation. The loads supplied by this system are listed
in Table 4.13.2. All éxcept two, which will be discussed
below, can tolerate short term power outages w1thout
serious consequences.

‘Panels IPP4, IPPA4, and IPP5 are all mounted on the
south ‘wall of the auxiliary control room. IPP7 is
located on the northeast wall of the high-bay area.

motor control center 3 through a 10-kVA single-phase
transformer. Most of the circuits served by IPP4 are
connected directly to circuit breakers in that panel as
shown in Fig. 4.13.2, but some require a regulated
voltage source, and these are connected to distribution
panel IPPA4. IPPA4, in turn, receives power from panel
IPP4 through a Sola harmonically neutralized sine-wave
constant-voltage transformer. Both distribution panels
are designed for use with 120/240-V single-phase,
three-wire grounded-neutral-type distribution circuits.

Two of the circuits that are normally energized from
panel IPP4 are automatically transferred to an alternate
source of power when the supply from IPP4 fails. One
of these is the temperature scanner circuit, which is
connected to circuit breaker 6 through relay contact
KBIPP4A as shown in Fig. 4.13.2. The temperature
scanner circuit is also connected to circuit breaker 3 in
instrument panel IPP3 through relay contact KBIPP4B.
When power is available from IPP4, relay KBIPP4 is
energized, contact KBIPP4B is open, contact KBIPP4A
is closed, and the temperature scanner receives power
from IPP4. If this power source fails, the relay
deenergizes, the contact positions reverse, and the
temperature scanner circuit connection is automatically
transferred to IPP3 with only a momentary interruption
of its supply of power. The other is the circuit which
supplies power to all of the recorders, recorder chart

drives, and the computer data logger clock. Normally it
is connected to circuit breaker 5 in IPP4, but the
connection is automatically transferred to circuit 5 in
IPP3. This is accomplished by a relay contact interlock
arrangement identical to the one just described.

The loss of the safety channel 2 instruments and
circuits is tolerated here on the basis that a single safety
input channel will not initiate safety system operations.
The other two safety channels are supplied from
separate battery-powered sources and would presum-
ably remain energized when the power from IPP4 is
lost. :

IPP5. 1PPS is a three-phase, four-wire circuit-breaker-
type distribution panel that is designed to serve both
120-V single-phase and 208-V three-phase loads. It
receives power from motor control center 3 through an
induction voltage regulator and 30-kVA step-down
transformer. The health physics instrument systems (see
ORNL-TM-729, Part 1IA, Sects. 2.9 and 2.11)!* are
supplied by the 120-V single-phase circuits. The motors
that drive the fuel sampler-enricher maintenance and
operational valves are supplied by the 208-V three-
phase circuits (see Sect. 3.17.1 of this report).

IPP7. Panel IPP7 receives power from motor control
center 4 through a 25-kVA single-phase step-down
transformer. It provides power for instruments and
control elements located in the north end of the
high-bay area and in the vent house. These include the
off-gas sampler system, the beryllium monitor, and
control circuits for the vacuum pumps serving the fuel
sampler-enricher and coolant sampler systems.

4.13.4 48-V DC System-

4.134.1 Power supply equipment. Instrument power
distribution panels IPP1 and IPPA1 are supplied from
the 48-V dc bus, which is also shown in Fig. 4.13.1. The
bus is energized by two 3-kW diverter-pole motor
generators,” MG 2 and MG 3, and a 24-cell storage
battery.®> Both motor generators may be operated at
the same time, but each one is capable of supplying the
full connected load (53.5 A at 56 V). The reliability of
the system is increased by connecting the generator
drive motors to separate TVA distribution buses. The
motor for MG 2 is connected to motor control center 3,
which is supplied from TVA-diesel-generator bus 3.
The motor driving MG 3 is supplied by an identical
arrangement from TV A—diesel-generator bus 4. _

When operating conditions are normal, the TVA
system is energized and supplies power to the 48-V dc
bus through the motor generators. The battery remains
connected to the bus at all times and is kept fully
 

 

 

C

charged by the output from the generators. The
potential is 48 V dc, and the discharge capacity is 600
A-hr when the battery is fully charged. If the output
from the generators is lost because of a TVA power
failure or for any other reason, the battery will
continue to supply the full load (53.5 A) on the 48-V
dc bus without interrupti on for at least 12 hr. During
this time the battery voltage will drop from48t0 42V,
but all of the dc-powered components in the system are

designed to’ operate normally with only 42V applied.

Annunciators sound in the auxiliary and main control
rooms when the bus voltage falls below 44 V to warn
the operator that the battery is neatly discharged. A
complete description of ‘the motor generators and the
battery is given in ORNL-TM-728, Part L.% -

The control panel for the 48-V dc system is located
outside the battery room at the 840-ft elevation.® The
control elements necessary for starting and stopping the
motors, for connecting the generators to the bus
mdrvrdually or in parallel, for detecting system grounds,
and for charging the battery are all located on the
control panel. An elementary dlagram of the motor-
generator control circuit is shown in Fig. 4.13. 4.° Each

~ motor is energized through the contacts of a magnetic

motor starter. The starter operating coils, C1, are
energized by the flow of current through the “start”
and “stop” push buttons in the low-voltage-release-type
circuits. Auxiliary contacts on the operating coils
control the operational mode indicator lamps — red
lamp for run mode,. green lamp for stop mode. The

175

The bus voltage is monitored continuously by the

‘undervoltage relay (UVR) as shown in Fig. 4.13.4.

When the bus voltage falls below 44 V dc, the relay
deenergizes. This produces audible and visual alarms on
the local panel, in the auxiliary control room (see
circuit 897, Fig. 4.1.53), and in the main control room
(see circuit 864, Fig. 4.1.52).

Each generator is equipped with an equalizer lead,
which is used only when the two machines are operated
in parallel. Its purpose is to ensure an equal division of
the load current between the two machines. In this case
the two equalizer leads are connected together by
closing the equalizer contactor C3. The control circuit
for contactor C3 is identical to those just described for
contactors C1 and C2. _

A ground-detector lamp circuit is also shown in Fig.
4.13.4. The lamps are connected in series between the
positive and negative buses. The connection common to
both lamps is grounded. Normally both lamps are dark
or burn dimly with equal brilliance. When the positive
bus becomes grounded the lamp connected to the

‘negative bus w111 be much brighter than the lamp

‘_connected to the negative bus. The conditions are
reversed when the negative bus becomes grounded.

generators are connected to the 48-V dc bus when the

magnetic contactor coils, C2, are energized. Each coil is
energized by the flow of current through a reverse

‘current relay contact (RCR) and the “start” and “stop”
push buttons, which are also connected to form a

low-voltage-release-type - control circuit. If the current

flowing through either generator reverses (operating as

motors on.battery power), the reverse current relay
(RCR) operates to open contact (RCR), which de-
energizes contactor coil C2 and disconnects the genera-

‘tor from the bus. Two auxiliary contacts. operated by

coil C2 control two position-indicator lamps — the red

lamp is energized when the contactor is closed, and the
_green: lamp. is energized when-the contactor is open.

Two .additional contacts operated by coil C2 are
connected in parallel in annunciator circuit 898 (see
Fig. . 4.1.53). When both of the C2 contactors are
deenergized at the same time, an audible and. visual
alarm is produced in the auxiliary and main control
rooms (see circuit 864, Fig. 4.1.52). This informs the
operator that the 48-V dc bus is bemg energized from
the battery

Three ‘voltmeters mounted on the control panel
mdrcate generator output voltages and the bus voltage.
Four ammeters, indicate bus current, battery currents
and generator load currents.

4.13.4.2 Distribution panels and circuits. IPPI. In-
strument power distribution panel IPP1 is mounted on
the south wall of the auxiliary control room alongside
several other panels which have already been described.
The .panel contains 14 double-pole circuit breaker
elements connected to two 100-A main buses and is
rated for use in 125/250-V dc distribution systems. One
pole of each breaker is connected to the positive leg of
each distribution circuit, and the other pole is con-
nected to the negatwe leg.?:

The 48-V dc system is considered to be the most
reliable of thé three power supplies; therefore the most
important circuits in the MSRE’ control system are
supphed through panels IPP1 and.IPPA1. These circuits
are identified in Table 4.13.3. The list includes, in

~addition to the safety channel 3 input relay circuits, the

safety relay circuits which, when deenergized, produce
load scrams (circuit 124, Fig. 4.1.10), emergency fuel
drains (circuits 18 and 19, Fig. 4.1.2), containment
block valve closures (see Figs. 4.1.3, 4.1.4, 4.1.5, and

'4.1.6), and control rod scrams (circuit 28, Fig. 4.1.2).
“The master control circuits (see Figs. 4.1.9, 4.1.11, and

4.1.12) are also energized through panel IPP1. All of
the above circuits energize control eélements which exert

a direct and immediate influence on the status of
operating conditions in the reactor primary system.
When deenergized, nearly all of the elements in the
above circuits act to shut down the reactor and in some
cases produce a system drain. Such drastic action is
neither desirable nor necessary when safety is not
involved. By connecting the elements to an uninterrupt-
ible supply of power, they remain available for use
during TVA power outages and other disturbances. This
enables the operator to limit the extent of the
shutdown or at least conduct a more orderly shutdown.

IPPA1L Instrument panel IPPA! distributes 120-V,
60-Hz ac power to the instrument components used in
the channel 3 safety systems. The supply side of panel
IPPA1 may be connected to either one of two power
sources, the reliable ac system or the 48-V dc system,
by the circuit arrangement shown in Fig. 4.13.2. The
panel is normally conpected to the 48-V dc system
through the 1-kW static inverter,! ! E,M-2000, but is
automatically transferred to the reliable ac system
through circuit 20 in IPP3 when the output from the
static inverter fails. When power is available from the
static inverter, E,M-2000, relay KIPP1 is energized,
contact KIPP1B is open, and contact KIPP1A is closed,

- connecting IPPA1 to E,M-2000. If the output from

EyM-2000 fails, the relay deenergizes, and the contact
positions reverse to connect IPPA1 to circuit 20 in
IPP3.

5. STANDARD PRQCESS INSTRUMENTATION
R. L. Moore

5.1 GENERAL

The MSRE process instrumentation system consists of
a large number of individual components. Wherever
possible, the system design was based on existing
technology, and components were procured from com-
mercial sources of supply, In most applications the
requirements were such that “standard” components
were suitable; however, in some applications, develop-
ment of special components was necessary {see Chap.
6).

Both pneumatic and electrical components are used in
the MSRE. Where transmission is electrical, the signal is
10 to 50 mA dc. Where transmission is pneumatic, the
signal is 3 to 15 psig air pressure. Both types of
transmission signals are indust’ry‘standards. The use of
electrical transmission of signals from primary elements
was given preference in the design because of the
relative ease of containment penetrations and because
the inputs to the computer data logger are electrical
voltages. However, in applications, such as the weigh
system described in Chap. 6, and in some applications
where the transmitter is located outside containment
and the signal from the: primary element is not
rnherently electrical, primary signals are transmitted
pneumatrcal]y In these applications, the pneumatic
systems offer advantages of cost, performance, or
compatlblhty with .environmental conditions which
outweigh those of the electrical systems. In most MSRE
applications, electrrcal]y transmitted primary signals
operate electronic receivers. Similarly, pneumatic pri-

mary signals usually operate pneumatic receivers. In

some cases, however, electrical signals were converted

to pneumatic, or vice versa. These conversions were

made where dictated by considerations of cost or
compatibility with overall system requirements. For
example, strain gage pressure transducers are used to
interface the pneumatic systems with the computer
data logger, and electric-to-pneumatic (I/P) converters
are used to operate pneumatic controllers from electric
signals.

T. M. Cate

Most of the final control elements in the MSRE are
pneumatically actuated valves. These valves are con-
trolled 'in two ways — manually and automatically.
Manual control is accomplished by means of a loading
station which consists of a manually operated pressure
regulator and an indicator. Automatic control is accom-
plished by means of a pneumatic controller.

Operation of electrical control circuit interlocks and
annunciators requires the opening or closure of electri-
cal contacts in response to variation of control signals
above or below a preset value. These contact actions are
generated in several types of devices. In many cases the
contact action is obtained indirectly by the use of
pressure switches connected to pneumatic transmission
lines or from electronic switches connected to electron-
ic transmission lines. In other cases the contact action is
obtained more directly by use of pressure switches
connected directly to process lines or vessels.

Some of the standard components commonly used in
the MSRE are discussed below. This discussion is
intended to indicate the types of components used in
the MSRE and does not cover all MSRE components.
For additional information on standard components
used in the MSRE, refer to the MSRE instrument
application tabulations and specification sheets and to
the manufacturers’ literature.!™ Considerable informa-
tion on the principles and practices of process instru-

“mentation and control is also available in open technical

291

literature. A particularly useful source of general
information and further reference is the Process Instru-
ments and Controls Handbook.’

5.2 ELECTRONIC
5.2. l Self-Balancmg-Bndge Indicators and Recorders

§.2.1.1 Strip-chart potentiometer recorder The strip-
chart recorders in the MSRE are self-balancing poten-
tiometric recorders. Figure 5.1 is a simplified diagram
of the recorder circuit. In the self-balancing poten-
tiometer, the balancing systém provides both the

 
 

 

detecting and the balancing means. An electronic
amplifier detects any unbalanced emf in the measuring
circuit, amplifies it, and applies it as power to drive a
halancing motor, which positions the slide-wire contac-
tor, the recording pen or printing mechanism, and an
indicating pointer. In the single-point recorders, the
slide-wire contactor has an indicating pointer and ink
pen attached which travels across a calibrated scale and
chart, providing both continuous indication and perma-
nent record. The chart is driven at a constant speed by
an electric motor. In the multipoint recorders, the pen
is replaced by a printing mechanism which is synchro-
nized with an automatic input selector switch. As-a
point is selected, the recorder automatically balances.
When balance is achieved, the number of the point is
printed on the chart, and the selector switch and print
wheel advance to the next point. Single-pen, two-pen,
12-point, 16-point, and 24-point recorders are used in
the MSRE instrument system. Most of the recorders
monitor temperatures measured by thermocouples, and
are equipped with cold junction compensation circuit-
1y.

5.2.1.2 Precision potentiometric indicators. One pre-
cision potentiometric indicator is used in the MSRE.
The operating principle of the precision indicator is

292

The connections to the differential transformer primary

~ and secondary are arranged so that the output signal

voltage from the differential transformer is in phase
opposition to the unbalance voltage developed between
point 1 and point 3 by the internal bridge. The output
of the internal bridge, point 3, is connected to the
unbalance voltage amplifier. As long as the voltage from
point 3 to point 1 is equal in amplitude and is 180° out
of phase with the voltage from point 1 to ground, the
voltage from point 3 to ground will be zero. If the
voltage from point 3 to ground is not zero, it can be
made so by changing the position of the rotor of the
variable balancing capacitor. When this condition exists,
the position of the capacitor rotor indicates the

~position of the differential transformer core. The

recording pen is linked directly to the capacitor rotor
and reads the differential transformer core position,
Point 3 is connected to the unbalance amplifier. Any

. voltage between this point and ground is first amplified

very similar to the strip-chart potentiometric recorders -

discussed in Sect. 5.2.1.1, and the circuit diagram, Fig.
5.1, in that section is equally applicable to the precision
indicator. The precision indicator is equipped with a
rotary scale which revolves about a fixed pointer, The
active scale length of the precision indicator is 28% in.,
thus giving much better resolution than is possible with
the stri-chart recorder.

The indicator in the MSRE system has a 0 to 2000°F

range with Chromel-Alumel type K thermocouples.
Forty-eight points can be manually selected and read by
means of a 48-point selector board. All inputs to the
selector board are terminated at the thermocouple
patch panel. This allows any 48 out of the more than
1000 thermocouples to be plugged into the precision
indicator at any time.

5.2.1.3 Foxboro Dynalog (ac bridge self-balancing
recorder). Figure 5.2 is a simplified diagram of a
Dynalog recorder used with differential-transformer-
type transmitters. The differential transformer primary
is connected to a 1000-Hz voltage source in the
recorder. The secondary voltage of the differential
transformer is directly proportional to the position of
its iron core and is applied to the recorder internal
bridge at point 1. The internal bridge is connected to
the 1000-Hz voltage source and is isolated from the
source supplying voltage to the differential transformer.

and then compared in phase to a reference voltage to
determine the direction of unbalance. The output of
the unbalance detector is a pair of dc voltages of
opposite polarity. These voltages differ in magnitude by
an amount proportional to the bridge unbalance and
provide the signals to the grids of the push-pull power
amplifier. The output current of the push-pull power
amplifier flows through the windings of the drive
motor, producing a magnetic force which causes the
drive rotor to move and drive the rotor of the balancing
capacitor in the internal bridge. The capacitor rotor is
moved to a position which unbalances the internal
bridge sufficiently to develop an output which cancels
the signal from the differential transformer. With both
signal sources unbalanced by the same amount, an
equilibrium condition is reached. The balancing action
is practically instantaneous, so the equilibrium condi-
tion is established continuously, and any change in core
position is recorded or indicated continuously. This
type of recorder is used in the MSRE to read out the
signal transmitted from the ball float level transmitter
described in Sect. 6.9. It can also be used with other
signal sources such as strain gages, thermocouples, and
resistance thermometers. Variations of the recorder
input circuitry are required for these applications;
however, the basic principles of operation are the same.

5.2.2 Foxboro ECI System

The Foxboro ECI system refers to a family of fully
electronic instruments, transmitters, recorders, indica-
tors, controllers, and final operators — all operating
with compatible current signal, and linked in a dc
 

 

 

293

transmission system. Process measurements are con-
verted at the transmitter to a proportional dc current
signal and are transmitted over unshielded lines to
remotely located receivers.

A major characteristic of the system design is replace-
ment of vacuum tubes with sturdy, yet sensitive,

magnetic amplifiers and other solid state devices. This

type of equipment is used extensively in the MSRE.

5.2.2.1 ECI recorder. The model 64 electromc re- .

corder is a panel-mounted 4-in. strip-chart recorder. It is
available as a one-pen or two-pen recorder with horizon-
tal pen motion.

‘The recorder input is 10 to 50 mA dc, which is the
standard transmission signal range for the Foxboro ECI
current-operated system. A magnetic torque motor,
which is basically a D’Arsonval meter movement, drives
the -pen directly from the input signal without further
amplification.

The recorder is completely independent of controllers

and other receiver units, all of which are connected in
series with the transmitter.
" 5.2.2.2 Emf-to-current converters. The type 693 emf-
to-current converter changes a de millivolt input signal
to a proportional 10- to 50-mA dc output signal. Spans
from 5 to 100 dc millivolts can be handled directly;
larger spans require voltage dividers. With this device,
thermocouples, strain gages, or other elements produc-
ing dc millivolts can be used to Operate'ECI receivers
such as recorders, controllers alarm units, and various
computmg instruments.

"The converter is an all-solid-state device making use of
magnetic amplifiers, silicon diodes, tantalum and alu-
minum capacitors, and printed circuits. A block dia-
gram of the converter is shown in Fig. 5.3. _

Referring to the block diagram, the input millivolt
signal, the feedback signal, and the bridge output are
summed algebraically. The resulting signal is the input
to the amphﬁer The bridge provides temperature
compensation where thermocouples are the measuring
element and establishes the amount of zero elevatlon
required.

The feedback ensures stable operation of the f" rst’ two

amplifier stages and determines the instrument span by

fixing the gain of the amplifier. The output signal of the
second stage is further amplified by the third and
fourth stages to provide the necessary 10- to 50-mA dc
output current. A separate feedback loop around the
third ‘and fourth stages provides stability of operation.

A potentiometer in the feedback circuit provides a fine -

span adjustment of 3% of span. A separately adjust-
able bias for the third stage provides a fine’ zero
adjustment of +3% of span. Coarse span and zero are

fixed by resistors in an externally located range and
zero unit. The range is easily changed by loosening six
screws and replacing the unit with another.

Since there are separate feedback loops around the
first two stages and the last two stages, there is
electrical isolation between the input and the output.
Hence, it is possible to ground either side of the input
signal when desired.

A closely regulated dc voltage is obtained from a
circuit using Zener diodes. This voltage provides the
bias for the third amplifier stage and also provides an
excitation for the bridge.

5.2.2.3 Vertical scale indicators. The model 65 PV
indicator is a standard 10- to 50-mA dc meter designed
for either vertical or horizontal mounting on either
magnetic or nonmagnetic materials. It is available with
the scale calibrated in a variety of units to fit nearly all
process variables. The indicator has a basic accuracy of
+2% of full scale and a damping factor of 5 or more.
The internal resistance of the meteris 5 2.

5.2.2.4 Differential pressure transmitters. The type
613 differential pressure transmitier measures differ-
ential pressures in the range of 0—20 to 0—250 in. H,0
or from 0-200 to 0-850 in. H,0. The pressure
differential is detected by the transmitter and converted
to a proportional 10- to 50- mA dc signal transmitted to
remote ECI receivers.

Figure 5.4 shows schematically the operation of the
type 613 differential pressure cell. In operation, a
change in the differential pressure across the diaphragm
capsule causes the force bar to pivot on the Eligiloy
diaphragm, resulting in lateral movement of 4 and B.
For instance, if the pressure on the high side of the
diaphragm increases, the force bar will pivot, moving
point A to the left. This causes the range rod to pivot at
C and thus moves the laminated core of the detector.
The movement of the detector core varies the air gap of
the detector, resulting in an increase in the inductive
coupling in the core which increases the secondary
voltage and the oscillator output, which is the amplifier
input (see Fig. 5.5).

The signal from the detector is fed to the base of
transmitter Q,, and the amplified signal from the
collector of Q, is fed back through the primary of the
detector. This positive feedback results in oscillations
which are regulated at approximately 1000 Hz by a

- tuned circuit. This variable-amplitude 1000-Hz signal is

rectified and applied to the base of Q,, which controls
the current flow through Q3. The 10- to 50-mA output
signal is fed to the feedback motor in series with the
load. As current in the winding of the feedback motor
increases, an increase in force is developed which

 
 

 

 

repositions the laminated core of the detector. This
force is simultaneous with any movement of the
laminated core and is in opposition to the force exerted
by the diaphragm on the lower end of the force bar.
Therefore, a balance of forces always exists.

The amplifier can be located up to 500 ft away from
the differential pressure transmitter when necessary but
must be interconnected by a six-wire shielded cable
instead of the usual two-wire unshielded signal leads.

§.2.2.5 Pressure transmitters. All ECI pressure trans-
mitters used in the MSRE are the specially designed
type 611TM-ASX described in Sect. 6.1. A standard
type 611 is available but was not used in the MSRE.
The main difference between the types 611 and
611GM-ASX is the construction of the bellows sensing
element. The principle of operation of both types is the
same as that of the differential pressure transmitter
described in Sect. 5.2.2.4 except that force applied to
the force bar is developed by the pressure difference
across a bellows.

5.2.2.6 Square root converter. The type 66A square
root converter extracts the square root of a 10- to

294

50-mA dc input signal and delivers it as a linear 10- to

50-mA dc output. This converter is used in several
MSRE flow systems to linearize the output of the flow
transmitter.

As shown by the block diagram in Fig. 5.6, the square
root converter is basically a two-stage magnetic ampli-
fier with negative feedback. A variable-resistance-diode
function generator circuit in the feedback circuit of the
amplifier varies the gain of the amplifier, changing the
resistance in the feedback circuit in such a way that the
output is a square root function of the input.

-§.2.2.7 Electronic multiplier-divider. The type 66D
* electronic multiplier-divider is a solid state instrument
which is designed to perform certain computing opera-
tions. The following equations can be solved by the
standard instrument.

The instrument receives either two or three 10- to

50-mA dc signals, depending on the application, and

produces an output of 10- to 50-mA dc proportional to

the solution of the equation being solved. In the above

equations, A, B, and C represent the input signals.

These signals are 10- to S0-mA dc signals which
represent such process variables as flow, temperature,
and pressure as transmitted by the ECI transmitters and
converters, D represents the output signal and K is a
constant. In the MSRE the type 66D multiplier-divider
is used to compute heat power from the product of
coolant salt flow and radiator A7, Two inputs are used
in this application.

A simplified block diagram of the basic mu]t:pller-
divider is shown in Fig. 5.7. The diode bridge is made
up of 12 diodes and 12 resistors and produces an
output signal proportional to a function involving
e,e;/e; when the bridge is excited by the sawtooth
generator. The amplifier is a transistorized high-gain dc
operational amplifier, which amplifies its input signal to
a usable level.

5.2.2.8 Resistance-to-current converter. The type
694 resistance-to-current converter converts the temper-
ature measured by a resistance temperature detector to
a 10- to 50-mA dc signal which can be transmitted to
other ECI receivers. The resistance-to-current converter
is very similar in operation and design to the type 693
emf-to-current converter discussed in Sect. 5.2.2.2. The
main difference is that, in the resistance-to-current
converter, the detector element becomes a part of the
bridge circuit. A Zener supply excites the bridge
through a voltage divider and establishes the required
instrument span, Varying the detector resistance results
in a 2 to 7 dc millivolt output signal from the bridge
which is algebraically summed with the feedback signal.

‘The resultant is the input to the first amplifier stage.

Operation beyond this point is identical to the emf-to-
current converter, ‘
§.2.29 Alarm switch. The model 63 ECI alarm units
open or. close relay contacts when a measurement signal
exceeds some preset limit or limits. The alarms can be
set to operate at a preset high or a preset low signal
from a transmitter. The set point is adjustable over
100% of the10- to 50-mA dc input signal span. Fail-safe
operation is possible where required. The alarms use
all-solid-state amplifiers and Zener regulated supplies.
This type of switch is used extensively in the MSRE.

o

295

Figure 5.8 is a simplified schematic of the alarm unit.
The input signal current develops a voltage ¥, across
R, , which is opposed by V from the Zener supply. The
difference is modulated by the chopper so that it will
be passed-by the transformer, Tx, to the input to the

amplifier. The amplifier raises the difference signal toa

level that is high enough to operate the relay. Action
can be reversed easily in the field by reversing diode D,
and the polarity of the chopper circuit output. This is
accomplished by - switching two jumper wires on an
alarm circuit card. 7

5.2.2.10 Current-to-pneumatic converter. The type
69TQ current-to-pneumatic converter is used in the
MSRE to convert 10- to 50-mA dc electrical s1gnals to
proportional 3- to 15-psi pneumatic signals.

Figure 5.9 is a schematic representation of the type
69T A converter. In operation, the 10- to 50-mA current
signal is applied to a coil which is wrapped around the
armature. The strength of the magnetic flux produced
by the coil is proportional to the current. |

With an increase in current through the coil, the
armature north and south poles become stronger and
react with greater force against the poles of the
permanent magnet. The south pole tends to move up
and the north pole down. The south pole has a greater
moment about the pivot, so the net moment is
clockwise. '

This clockwise movement causes the nozzle to be
covered. This increases the pneumatic output and
increases the pressure in the feedback bellows. The
force exerted by the feedback bellows increases until it
balances the force caused by the increase in signal
current. Reduction of input current results in the
opposite sequence of events. Therefore, during static
conditions, a balance of forces always exists, and the
pneumatic' output is proportional to the current input.

5.2.2.11 General features of ECI system. All trans-

mitters, Teceivers, and operators in the ECI system are
calibrated to a common signal of ‘10 to 50 -mA direct
current. Load value for one-or a combination of several
receivers is fixed at 600 Q £10%. All receivers must be
connected in series. - -

"All panel-mounted ECI instruments are mounted by
means of a separately mounted housing. Connection of
the instrument to the housing is accomplished by
plugging into a receptacle at the end of a stretch-out
cord, which in turn is connected to a terminal strip at
the rear of the housing. This allows partial or complete
withdrawal of the instrument from the front of the
panel. : '
‘An automatic interlock removes power from the
instrument before it .can be unplugged. Most ECI

instruments are designed so that removal of the
instrument from its housing will not disrupt operation
by breaking continuity of the 600- series loop.

5.3 PNEUMATIC
5.3.1 Pneumatic Receivers and Modifiers

5.3.1.1 Receiver gages. Receiver gages are special-
purpose Bourdon- or bellows-type pressure gages which
are manufactured and calibrated to read zero with 3
psig applied and to read full scale with 15 psig applied.
The scales on receiver gages can be chosen to read
linearly from 0 to 100%. of full scale or can be
calibrated to read directly in engineering units. Receiver
gages are commonly used with nonindicating-type
pneumatic transmitters for indication at the point of
measurement or as a repeater to indicate the measure-
ment at some remote location. |

5.3.1.2 Model 50 pneumatic ribbon indicator. The
model 50 ribbon-type indicator is basically a pneumatic
bellows-type receiver that is operated by a 3- to 15-psi
pneumatic signal. The visible indication is a red-and-
white nylon ribbon appearing in back of a glass scale.
This type of indicator was particularly useful in the
MSRE main board graphic display.

5.3.1.3 Foxboro model 54 pneumatlc recorder. The
model 54 pneumatic recorder, shown in Fig. 5.10,
receives standard 3- to 15-psig pneumatic signals from
any pneumatic transmitter and makes a permanent
record of this signal in ink on a 4-in.-wide paper chart.
Two types of recorders are used in the MSRE instru-
ment system. One type is for recording and/or indica-
tion only. The other type is for recording and/or
indication also, but in addition serves as the control
station for a process controller (see Sect. 5.3.2.3).

The difference between the two types is the addition
of a set-point transmitter, a valve position or output
pressure indicator, and a connection manifold assembly
for 'a controller ‘to the units required. to control a
process variable. The diagram in Fig. 5.10 shows a
typical recorder control station with set-point trans-
mitter. In operation the signal is applied to the receiver
bellows, which works against a_flexure-pivoted arm.
Changes in the measurement air pressure move the
bellows against this arm. This motion is transmitted

" through the linkage to the recording pen or indicating

pointer. Zero and span adjustments are determined by
springs. A tapered shank resistance is located in the
input signal line of the input bellows and can be used to
dampen pulsating pressures due to extraneous influ-
ences on the measuring device. The set-point transmit-
 

 

 

 

ter is basically a pressure regulator which produces a 3-
to 15-psig reference pressure determined by the posi-
tion of the set-point lever (knurled wheel). The M54
design is such that it can be easily removed from a panel
for recalibration, replacement, or repair without dis-
turbing the piping or process. The recorder housing is
permanently connected to the instrument panel.
5.3.1.4 Multifunction pneumatic relays. The Moore
Products Company multifunction relay is a pneumatic

computing device which allows functions such as

addition, subtraction, integration, and differentiation to
be performed on one or more pneumatic signals. Figure
5.11 shows details of one configuration of the multi-
function relay along with connection diagrams and
equations for three typical applications. In the equa-
tions, K is the suppression, and 4, B, C, and D are the
pressure chambers. The multifunction relay is not
limited to the configurations shown in the illustration.
Moore Products Company Bulletin No. AD-68 shows
diagrams of 50 of the most frequently used configura-
tions and states that more than 1000 different combina-
tions of the assembly are possible.

5.3.1.5 Strain-gage-type pressure transducer. In sever-
al instances in the MSRE system it was desired to log
process variables whose primary measuring device trans-
mitted a pneumatic signal. In these cases a Statham
model TPG60-15-350 unbonded strain gage pressure
transducer was utilized to generate a precise electrical
analog of the pneumatic signal. Construction details of
the transducer are shown in Fig. 5.12. Figure 5.13 is a
schematic diagram of the transducer electrical circuit.
The force produced be applying pressure to the bellows
stresses four strain gages arranged in a balanced Wheat-
stone bridge which provides a stepless output and an
ultimate resolution limited only by the characteristics
of the receiver. As seen in the schematic, Fig. 5.13, an
integral zero and span adjustment is provided which
allows field calibration and precise matching of several
transducers. Maximum excitation for the transducer is
14 V dc or ac (rms). The transducer output is
approximately 2.5 mV dc per volt of excitation with
full range pressure applied.

5.3.1.6 Pressure switches. In many cases in the MSRE
system an electrical contact opening or closure is
required for operation of alarms and interlocks when a
pneumatic signal pressure varies above or below a preset
value. Pressure switches are used for this purpose. The
switch most frequently used in the MSRE is the
Minneapolis-Honeywell type LR404H1027. This switch
has a set point adjustable from 0 to 15 psi and a fixed
differential of 0.2 psi. Contacts in the switch are rated
for26Aat120Vor13 Aat240V.

5.3.2 Transmitters and Controllers

5.3.2.1 Foxboro type 13A and type 15A differential
pressure transmitters. The Foxboro type 13A and type
15A differential pressure transmitters are differential
pressure measuring devices operating on the force
balance principle. The two types can be discussed
simultaneously because in principle of operation they
are identical. The only differences between the two
types are the sensing elements and body design and the
range of differential pressures which they can measure.
Schematic diagrams of a type 13A transmitter are
shown in Fig. 5.14. Referring to Fig. 5.14, the
operation of the 13A is as follows. Process pressures are
applied to opposite sides of a twin-diaphragm capsule
(F) through the high- and low-pressure connections (M).
Any resulting differential pressure exerts a force on the
twin-diaphragm capsule, which is rigidly connected to
the force bar (C) by the flexure E. The Elgiloy
diaphragm D acts as a seal and as a fulcrum for the
force bar. The force bar transmits a force, which is
exactly proportional to the differential pressure on the
sensing capsule, by means of the flexure B to the range
bar (H), causing the range bar to pivot about the range
wheel (/).

Any motion of the range bar is detected by the
flapper (A), thereby producing a flapper-nozzle rela-
tionship which establishes, from relay K, an output
pressure which is the transmitted pneumatic signal. The
output pressure is simultaneously transmitted to the
feedback bellows (G). The force exerted by the
feedback bellows is exactly proportional to the force
applied to the range bar (&) by the force bar (C). Since
the force exerted by the force bar is exactly propor-
tional to the differential pressure, the pressure in the
feedback bellows and to the output is exactly propor-
tional to the differential pressure. In operation the
motion of the range bar is continuously adjusting the
flapper-nozzle relationship to maintain a balance of
forces between the forces exerted by the feedback
bellows and by the force bar. -

Type 13A and type 15A differential pressure trans-
mitters are used in several flow and level measuring
applications in the MSRE system.

5.3.2.2 Foxboro Company model 52 controller. The
model 52A Consotrol controller is an indicating
receiver-controller designed to occupy a minimum of
panel space. The air circuits for the Consotrol controller
are divided between an upper and lower unit, intercon-
nected by flexible air connections. The upper unit
contains the measurement receiver bellows with its
indicating scale and the control unit with its setting

-
 

 

297

adjustments. The lower unit contains the relay, nozzle
bleeds, manual control parts, and transfer switch.

Figure 5.154 is a schematic of a controller employing
a proportional action control circuit. Control units
having proportional plus reset action or proportional
plus reset and derivative action may also be employed
(see Figs. 5.15B and 5.15C).

Referring to Fig. 5.154, the receiver line is connected
to the upper unit, and the measurement is read on the
main scale. The flapper of the flapper nozzle assembly

is automatically positioned by the resultant of the

motions of the receiver bellows, index setting knob, and
the proportional bellows of the control unit. The
-resulting nozzle pressure is conveyed by ﬂexnble tubing
to the lower unit. '

Air supply enters-the controller through the lower
unit, and the flow to the nozzle is restncted by a
reducmg tube in this unit. :

In automatic operation, the transfer switch is in the
position shown in Fig. 5.154, thus placing. nozzle
pressure on the diaphragm of the control relay. The
control relay acts as a high-gain power amplifier and
also eliminates loading effects on -the nozzle, thus
increasing overall system gain and response. The output
of the relay is connected to the final control element.
The output is also indicated on the output pressure
indicator, and is conveyed to the proportioning bellows
of the control unit by tubing between the lower and
upper units. The pressure in the proportioning bellows
produces a force which causes the flapper nozzle
assembly to move to a position which maintains the
‘output pressure at-a value proportional to the deviation
between the measurement and the set point. When reset
action is - added, as shown in Fig. 5.15B, the output
pressure is also conveyed to a reset béllows via a
restrictor and capacity tank. When pressure is applied to

the reset bellows, a force is produced which opposes the

force produced in the proportioning bellows. Buildup
of pressure in the feset bellows (and of the resultant
force) is delayed by the action of the restrictor and
capacity tank. The net effect of the reset circuit is to
increase the low-frequency gain of the controller, with
the result that the controller produces a greater
corrective action for slow (low-frequency) changes in
the measurement signal than for fast (high-frequency)
changes. In most cases the practical result of reset
action is to eliminate the offset effect present in
proportional controllets and cause the -controller to
control on the set point instead of at some point above
or below the set point. In some cases, reset action can
be used to increase system stability; however, in most
systems the presence of the reset action will reduce the

low- frequency stability of the system, and improper use
of the reset functlon can result in uncontrolled oscilla-
tions.

When derivative ‘action is added, as shown in Fig.
5.15C, the high-frequency gain of the controller is
increased. This action is accomplished by delaying the
buildup of pressure in a portion of the proportioning
bellows with a restrictor and capacity tank assembly.
The net effect of the addition of the derivative circuit is
that the controller produces a greater corrective action
for fast changes in the measurement signal than for slow

‘changes. Derivative action is used mainly to speed up

the response of slow systems but is sometimes useful in
improving system stability. The use of derivative action
is not recommended in systems where a high-frequency
noise is present on the measurement signal.

For manual operation, the transfer switch is swung to
the “manual” position. This removes the “automatic”
nozzle pressure from the relay diaphragm and substi-
tutes the pressure at the “manual” nozzle. The pressure
at this nozzle can be manually varied by the manual
control knob, thus changing the pressure on the relay
diaphragm and, in turn, the output pressure.

The transfer indicator is used to facilitate smooth
transfer between manual and automatic control or vice

“versa. The “automatic” nozzle is always connected to

the upper bellows of the transfer indicator, and the
“manual” nozzle is connected to the lower bellows.
When the nozzle pressures are equal, as indicated by the
balanced position of the transfer indicator, control may
be transferred wnth no upset or change of output
pressure.

The lower unit may be used to maintain the process
on manual control in event the upper unit is removed
for any reason. A balil check automatically closes the
output ‘port to prevent the escape of air when the
flexible tubing is removed.

Model 52 controllers are used in several apphcatlons
in the MSRE to automatically control process variables
such as level and pressure. For a compléte explanation
"of the control functions, proportional, ‘reset, and
derivative, the reader is referred to Chap. 9 of the
Process Instruments and Controls Handbook. S

5.3.2.3 Foxboro Company mode] 58 controller. The
Foxboro Company model 58 controller is a small,
compact automatic pneumatic’ process controller
designed to mount on the rear of a model 53 or 54
recorder or field mount by means of a field mounting
adapter plate. Model 58 controllers are used in both
ways in the MSRE system to control such variables as
pressure, flow, and temperature. The model 58 is
available in proportional only, proportional with reset,
 

 

and proportional with reset and derivative versions. A

298

schematic of a three-term version of the model 58 is

shown in Fig. 5.16 for duscussion purposes.

The model 58 Consotrol controller operates on the
force-balance principle. The “ﬂoatmg disk™ acts as the

flapper of a conventional flapper-nozzle system. The

resultant of the forces due to the upward pressure of
the bellows units determines the position of the floating
disk in relation to the nozzle. Hence, the relay output
pressure varies with changes in pressure in any of these
bellows. .

‘A change in pressure in the measurement or set
bellows moves that side of the floating disk up or down
and causes a change in nozzle pressure which results in
an increased or decreased output pressure from the
control relay. This variance in output pressure acts to
reposition the control valve, thus bringing about a
change in the measurement bellows. It is also fed back
to the proportioning bellows. This continues until a
balance of forces is restored against the floating disk.
Thus, changes in output pressure are proportional to
changes in measurement or set pressure.

Changes in the output pressure are fed to the reset

bellows, as well as to the proportioning bellows, but at
a rate depending upon the setting of the reset restric-
tion or resistance. This resetting action continues until
the pressures in the proportioning and reset bellows are
equal. However, this action occurs at an ever-decreasing
rate as the final balance point is reached, at which time
the measurement and set pressures are equal. Thus,
reset action is dependent on the deviation of the
measurement from the control set point and the setting
of the reset restriction.

A derivative effect is obtained by interposing a
derivative resistance in the feedback line between the
output and the proportioning bellows. Thus, air flowing
to or from the proportioning bellows due to changes in
the measurement or set pressure causes a pressure drop
to occur across the derivative restriction. Pressure in the
output line is greater or less than that in the propor-
tioning bellows by the amount of this drop. Hence, the

position of the final control element is determined by
the combined proportional and reset effect plus or
minus the derivative effect, and its position will thus be
reached more quickly when derivative action exists.

A small bellows extending into the derivative capacity

tank is provided on controllers with derivative action. It

is connected directly to the controller output and
ensures stability when sudden process upsets occur.

' '5.3.3 Final Control Elements

With a few exceptions, all pneumatically operated
final control elements in the MSRE are bellows- or
diaphragm-actuated control valves. The special weld-
sealed valves used in the MSRE are described in Sect.
6.5. Other MSRE valves are similar in operation to
those described in Sect. 6.5, but differ in body
construction, material of construction, and ﬂow charac-.
teristics. - :

Pneumatic signals are also used to posmon devices
such as Variacs (variable transformers). In these applica-
tions, positioning is accomplished by pneumatic actua-
tors similar to those used to position control valves.

6. SPECIAL PROCESS lNS’i‘RUMENTATlON SYSTEMS

R. L. Moore
G.H.Burger J. W.Krewson
D. G. Davis

6.1 PRESSURE TRANSMITTERS (WELD-SEALED)
6.1.1 Introduction

Two types of special weld-sealed pressure transmitters
are used on the MSRE. One is the Foxboro Instrument
Company type 611GM-ASX,' and the other is the
Dynisco model APT45-SP-1C.> Both types of trans-
mitters measure pressures in the helium cover gas spaces

of the MSRE fuel- and .coolant-salt systems where

absolute containment of the process fluid is essential.
The Foxboro type 611GM-ASX transmitters (Fig.
6.1.1) are directly connected to the cover gas spaces of
the fuel- and coolant-salt systems pump bowls, drain
tanks, and helium supply lines. They are also used in
the fuel- and coolant-salt pump lube oil systems, which
connect directly to the cover gas systems. These
transmitters are identical to the Foxboro Company’s
standard commercially available units except for the
pressure sensing elements, which have been modified to
meet the containment requirements of the MSRE.? The
Dynisco model APT45-SP-1C transmitters (Fig. 6.1.4)
are used to measure helium purge gas pressures in the
fuel-salt sampler-enricher, the coolant-salt sampler, and
the fuel-salt processing system sampler.. These are
identical to Dynisco’s standard model except for the
process connections, which are specially designed weld
nipples.*

6122 Fbrcé-Balance TYpe

"6.1.2.1 Principles of operation. The spec:al type'
6llGM-ASX pressure transmitter is a force-balance

instrument that measures pressure and transmits it as a
pr0port10nal 10- to 50-mA dc signal, Except for the

pressure sensing element, which is déscribed in’the

following paragraph, the signal detecting and__ trans-
mitting components are identical to those on the
standard differential pressure transmitter described in
Sect. 5.2.2 and will not be discussed here.

P. G. Herndon

6.1.2.2 Construction. The pressure sensing assembly,
shown in Fig. 6.1.2, is made of type 316 stainless steel
and consists of a special bellows-capsule subassembly
mounted inside of a standard Foxboro type 611 forged
body. The construction of the stainless steel bellows
capsule is shown in Fig. 6.1.3. All joints are seal welded
to form'a leak-tight chamber which contains the process
fluid. Connection to the process is made by means of
the Autoclave Engineers, Inc., %-in. male adapter. The
process fluid, which is helium gas, enters the chamber,’
where pressure is applied to the bellows capsule through
the capillary tube. The force on the bellows capsule is
transmitted through a flexure member to the lower end
of the force bar. The arrangement of the bellows
capsule and body is a feature that is used to good
advantage on the MSRE. The body, when properly
connected to the MSRE containment air system,
provides a secondary containment barrier which will
prevent the release of process fluid if the bellows.
capsule assembly develops a leak (see Sect. 6.2). The
high quality of each unit is assured by the strict
procedures observed to control material composition,
cleanliness, and fabrication methods during construc-

- tion operations.

6.1.2.3 Performance characteristics. The perform-
ance charactenstlcs and operating conditions are as
follows:

Measurement range 40 to 250 psig |
Measurement accuracy 0.5% of range span

Two transmitters selected at random from the lot
were subjected to rigid performance tests before any
were accepted for use in the reactor system.

6.1.3 Strain Gage Type

6.1.3.1 Operating principle and construction. The '

construction of the Dynisco unbonded strain gage
pressure transmitter is shown in Fig. 6.1.4. All
process-fluid-containing joints are seal welded, and all
material in contact with the process fluid is 347
stainless steel except the weld nipple, which is made of
400 series stainless steel. The basic pressure sensing
element is a diaphragm which is welded at its rim to the
transmitter body. An actuating rod joins the diaphragm
to the two armature beams of the strain gage mounting
assembly. This is shown schematically in Fig. 6.1.5 by
the diagram in the inset. The armature is held in place
by two flexure members which are fastened rigidly at
one end to the fixed support membeér. Application of
pressure to the diaphragm produces a force which is
converted to motion by the spring characteristics of the
flexure member. This motion is measured by strain
gages. Span is determined by the spring rate of the
flexure members. Four separate strain gage resistance
elements, each formed by several turns of fine wire, are
held under tension between the armature and the fixed
support frame. These four resistance elements (4, B, C,
and D) are connected into a Wheatstone bridge circuit,
also shown in Fig. 6.1.5.

Thus an increasing pressure on the diaphragm raises
the actuating rod and moves the armature in such a
manner as to increase the strain in resistance elements A
and B and decrease the strain in elements C and D. The
result is an unbalance in the bridge circuit which yields
an output signal proportional to the pressure on the
diaphragm. The case is sealed and evacuated, resulting
in vacuum reference and absolute pressure range.

6.1.3.2 Performance  characteristics. The perform-
ance characteristics and operating conditions are as
follows:

Measurement range

6.2 PRESSURE TRANSMITTER
- REFERENCE CHAMBERS

Although the Foxboro ECI pressure transmitters,
described in Sect. 6.1 above, satisfy the requirements for
primary containments, they present only one barrier to
the escape of radioactive materials when the bellows
assembly is referenced directly to the atmosphere. Two
barriers are required when the - transmitters -are
connected directly to the reactor primary system. Since
the transmitter sensing bellows assembly is completely
enclosed by the transmitter body, the containment
requirements could have been satisfied by plugging the
reference port. This approach was undesirable because
variation in ambient temperature would produce
variations in the pressure of entrapped air on the
reference side of the bellows, which, in turn, would
produce corresponding variations in the transmitted
signal. Complete evacuation of air from the reference
side of the bellows would have eliminated the ambient
temperature effects; however, any inleakage of air
would have produced downscale zero shifts. This latter
approach was seriously considered but was abandoned
when it was determined that obtaining the degree of
leak-tightness necessary to prevent long-term zero
drifts would require considerable effort and expense.
The containment requirements could also have been
satisfied by means of instrumented closures consisting
of solenoid valves installed in reference port vent lines
and actuated by radiation monitors. This approach was
considered to be undesirable because the use of
individual block valves and monitors on each
transmitter would have been too complex and costly.
Also, the use of a common system would have resuited
in downscale shifts in the signal from all other
transmitters connected to the commmon vent line if one
transmitter bellows failed.

To circumvent this problem, a device was developed
which would provide a second barrier to the escape of
activity without interfering with the performance of the
 

sl B

transmitter. This device consists of a floating diaphragm
assembly in a housing (see Fig. 6.2.1). The volume above
the diaphragm is connected to the reference port of the
pressure transmitter. The volume below the diaphragm
is at atmospheric pressure. During normal operation,
the device acts as a free-floating slack diaphragm and
introduces less than 0.1% error in the transmitter signal.
In the event of a rupture of the bellows assembly in the
transmitter, the device will contain the released radio-
active gases. A limit switch is provided which will detect
bottoming of the diaphragm resulting from bellows
failure in the transmitter. All switches are connected to
a common annunciator in the main control room.

A fringe benefit resulting from the use of the
reference chamber and from the inherent design of the
transmitter is the ability to remotely test the
operability of the transmitter during reactor shutdown.
Such tests are accomplished by removing the protective
cap at the bottom of the chamber, pushing or pulling
on the guide shaft, and observing response of the
receiving instrument. Failure to respond is an indication
of a degradation of the sensitivity of the transmitter or
receiver which, in turn, is an indication of incipient
failure. To permit such testing, the MSRE reference
chambers were installed outside of biological shielding
in areas that were accessible durlng shutdown or durmg
low-power operation of the reactor.

When operating conditions permit, additional checks
on the accuracy of the transmitter range calibration
may be made by pressuring the area between the
reference chamber and the transmitter and comparing

309

the pressure applied with the change in indicated

pressure. Provisions were made in the design of the
reference chamber and of the reference port piping to
permit such tests to be performed safely w1thout
dlsassembly of piping systems. Lo

6. 3 DIFF ERENTIAL PRESSURE TRANSMITTERS
: - (WELD SEALED)

. 6.3.1 Introductlon

The specxal weld-sealed dlfferentxal pressure transmit-
ters (Figs. 6.3.1 and 6.3.2) are used to measure flow
rates, liquid levels, and pressure drops in the helium
cover gas spaces of the MSRE fuel- and coolant-salt
systems where absolute containment of the process
fluid is essential. They are directly connected to the
cover gas spaces of the fuel- and coolant-salt systems

 pump bowls, off-gas lines, and helium supply lines.

They are used on the fuel- and coolant-salt pumps lube
oil systems, which connect directly to the cover gas

systems, and on the liquid waste tank. Two types of
Foxboro Instrument Company transmitters are used on
the MSRE. Both types are identical except for the
signal transmitting mechanisms. The type 13XA trans-
mits a pneumatic signal, and the type 613HM transmits
an electronic signal. Both types are also identical to the
Foxboro Company’s standard commercially available
units described in Sect. 5.2.2 and 5.3.2 except for the
body, which has been modified to meet the contain-
ment requirements of the MSRE. The special feature of
these instruments is the leak-tight construction of the -
body assembly. All process-containing joints on the
body assembly are seal welded. The design, fabrication,
and testing of these transmitters are described by the
company specifications'*? and the vendors’ construc-
tion drawings and test reports.?

6.3.2 Principles of Operation

The pressure sensing element in both types of
transmitters is mechanically coupled to a force-balance
system. This system detects and converts differential
pressure to a proportional signal which is transmitted to
remote receivers. The type 13XA transmits a 3- to
15-psig pneumatic signal, and the type 613HX transmits
a 10- to 50-mA electronic signal. The instruments
operate in the same manner as described in Sect. 5.2.2
and 5.3.2 for the standard Foxboro type 13 and type
613 differential pressure transmitters.

- 6.3.3 Constructidn

The signal detecting and transmitting components are
identical to those on the standard differential pressure
transmitter described in Sect. 5.2.2 and 5.3.2 and will .
not be discussed here. The differential pressure sensing
assembly, shown in Fig. 6.3.2, consists of a silicone-
fluid-filled diaphragm-capsule  subassembly mounted
inside of a modified standard high-pressure Foxboro
type 613HM forged body. The modifications are the

- specially machined lips, which are seal welded to form

the process-containing joints. All body- material is 316
stainless steel except the silicone fluid in the diaphragm
capsule and the Elgiloy diaphragm :which serves as a
fulcrum for the force bar. Elgiloy is a steel alloy with
good spring characteristics. Connections to the process
are made by means of Autoclave Engineers, Inc., %-in.

female fittings machined in the body. The high quality

of each unit is assured by the strict procedures observed
to control material composition, cleanliness, and fabri-
cation methods during construction operations.

6.4 CELL AIR OXYGEN ANALYZER
6.4.1 Introduction

Before the MSRE is placed in operation, most of the
air is evacuated from the secondary containment
enclosure, which is then filled with nitrogen to a normal
operating pressure of 2 psig negative. During operations
a cell atmosphere of nitrogen containing less than 5%
(by volume) of oxygen is maintained at all times. The
low oxygen content serves to eliminate the hazards of
combustion in case oil leaks from the fuel pump
lubricating system onto hot pipes in the reactor cell.
Nitrogen is added to the enclosure as needed to make
up for air inleakage. The leak rate into the enclosure is
determined by: (1) observing changes in absolute
pressure, (2) observing the change in differential pres-
sure between the enclosure and a temperature- compen-

¥

310

sating reference volume located inside the enclosure,
and (3) observing the changes in oxygen content of the
atmosphere in the enclosure. This section describes the
instrument system used to measure the oxygen content
of that atmosphere.

' 6.4.2 Oxygen Analyzer

The oxygen content of the containment atmosphere
is monitored continuously by an on-line analyzer
system, which is shown in Fig. 6.4.1. The heart of the
system, which was assembled and checked out at
ORNL, is a Beckman Instruments, Inc., model F3
oxygen analyzer. The operation of the instrument is
based on a measurement of the magnetic susceptibility
of the gas that is being analyzed. A complete descrip-
tion is given in the Beckman Instruction Manual.! The
basic requirement was to detect a change in oxygen
content of 0.02% (by volume) over the range from 4.9
to 5.1%. The Beckman instrument, which has two
measuring ranges (0—10% and 0—25%) is capable of
measuring oxygen content with an accuracy of 1% of
full scale value. The desired sensitivity (0.02%) is
obtainable over the full measuring range of the instru-
ment when a potentiometer-type device is used to read
the output signal. When the 0 to 25% range is selected,
the oxygen content can be monitored over the range
from normal air (approximately 22% oxygen) to, and
below, the normal 5% operating level.

The inlet gas to the analyzer is taken from the reactor
cell evacuation line 565 in the vent house and is
discharged to line 566 as shown in Fig. 64.1. A
pressure differential exists between these two lines,
which form a low-flow bypass loop across the compo-
nent cooling pumps (see Fig. 3.6.0). These pumps
continuously circulate the atmosphere within the
containment enclosure. Since the pressure rating of the
analyzer (30 psig) is less than the 50 psig minimum
required for secondary containment enclosures and
since a possibility existed that the sampled air could be
contaminated, safety-grade block valves were installed
in both the inlet and discharge lines to maintain the
integrity of the containment enclosure and to protect
the operators, The valves are also used for routine
operations and for maintenance purposes. The arrange-
ment of the valves in the inlet and discharge lines is
shown in Fig. 6.4.2. The control- and safety-grade
circuits for the valves are described in Sect. 4.8.3.6.

The gas sample also passes through a cold trap, where
moisture is removed, and then through a heated section
of inlet pipe before it enters the analyzer. To obtain
accurate measurements, the sample entering the analysis
 

 

cell must be dry, and the sample temperature must be
between 50 and 110°F. The cell must also be
operated at the same pressure used when it was
calibrated. A back-pressnre' regulator installed in the
discharge line holds the pressure in the cell constant at
14.7 psia.

The analysis cell may also be connected to' two
reference gas supply lines for calibration and purging
operations. The connection to either the sample gas line
or the two reference gas supply lines is made by
manipulating the three-way selector valve shown in Fig.
6.4.1. The pure nitrogen supply is used to set the zero
point of the measuring cell. The 95% nitrogen—oxygen
mixture is used to adjust the range of measurement.
Both reference gas lines are equipped with check valves
to prevent the containment air sample from back-
flowing and with pressure relief valves that open when
pressures over 20 psig are applied.

" 6.5 CONTROL VALVES (WELD-SEALED)
6.5.1 Introduction '

The special control valves discussed in this section are
used primarily in the fuel- and coolant-salt cover gas
systems where a high degree of cleanness, absolute
containment of the radioactive process fluid, and tight
shutoff characteristics are essential. _They control flows
in hehum supply lines, off-gas lines, and iubncatmg oil
lines, all of which connect directly to the cover gas
spaces of the fuel- and coolant-salt systems They are
also used in the liquid waste storage system. Absolute

tures and nuclear radiations are low. The other is a
special all-metal bellows type for use on valves located
in areas where nuclear radiations or ambient tempera-
tures or both are high.

6.5.2 Construction

The valve shown in Fig. 6.5.1 is typical. It was
designed, constructed, and- tested by the Mason-Neilan
Division of the Worthington Corporation in accordance
with ORNL Job Specification Number J$-81-160." In
addition to the pneumatic operator, the valve shown is
composed essentially of three main parts, the lower
body with its replaceable seat, the upper body or
bonnet that contains the secondary stem packing, and
the movable stem which includes the plug at its lower
end and the bellows seal which is attached to the stem
near the plug with a seal-type weld. The upper part of
the bellows is attached to a thin flange which acts as a
gasket between the upper and lower parts of the body.

This flange extends to the outer edge of the lower

body, and the outer edge of the flange is turned up to
form a lip that mates with a similar lip machined on
the upper surface of the lower body. These lips are
designed to be welded together, but this is the final step
in the assembly procedure. To assemble the valve, the
stem with bellows attached is first inserted, and then
the upper and lower body parts are properly aligned
and bolted together. Next, several operational tests are
performed to check the stem movement for signs of
binding and to measure the leak rate through the port.
If the performance is not satisfactory the valve is
disassembled and reworked until satisfactory perform-
ance is achieved.

Just before the valve is installed in the system, the

seal weld is made, and the body, including the weld, is

subjected to-hydrostatic pressure tests and leak tests.
All parts of the valve except the Stellite 6 seat and

17-4 PH plug are fabricated of either 304 or 316

stainless steel. One member of all stainless steel bearing

- surfaces, sliding parts, and screwed joints is fabricated
-from 416 stainless steel to reduce the possibility of

containment of the helium gas supply is also required

for reasons of economy. Since helium gas is relatively
expens:ve leakage must be held to a minimum.

Since most of the valves are located in remote areas,
remotely operated actuators were required. ‘Preumati-
cally powered actuators were selected for these appli-
cations because they are highly reliable devices, readily
available  from commercial- sources. Two types. of
operators were used. One is a conventional elastic-
diaphragm type for use in areas where ambient tempera-

galling.

The stem sealing bellows is a three-ply 304 stamless
steel unit fabricated by the Fulton Sylphon Division of
Robertshaw Controls Company., It has a life expectancy
rating of over 20,000 mechanical cycles of full %-in.
valve -stroke when operating at 500°F with a 350-psi
differential pressure applied to the bellows wall.

Conventional packing of oil-free graphited asbestos in _

the valve bonnet forms a secondary stem seal. A fitting,
machined in the side wall of the bonnet, may be used to
 

 

 

 

pressurize or to detect a leak in the stem seal bellows.
Additional protection against leakage which could
result from a ruptured bellows is provided by the
back-seating portion of the valve stem. This portion of
the stem and the seat are located inside the bonnet.

The unique features of the ' in. valve body, aside
from the welded stem-seal bellows, are the integral
ring-joint-flange end connections. Compared with a
conventional flanged valve, this design eliminates the
need for two welds and two mating flanges. The integral
joints also simplify the problems of leak detection. By
utilizing the leak detector hole connecting the roots of
the two ring grooves and by drilling a similar hole
through the two mating ring gaskets (thus connecting
all four volumes between the gaskets and the flange
grooves), only one leak detector connection is required
for each valve.

Additional construction details are shown in refs. 2
and 3. ‘

follows:

6.5.4 Operators

The operator shown on the valve in Fig. 6.5.1 is the
conventional spring-loaded elastic diaphragm type. It is
manufactured by the Foxboro Instrument Company
and is used on valves located in areas where the nuclear
radiation intensity is low and the ambient temperature
variations are not extreme.

The operator shown in Fig. 6.5.2 is a special all-metal
spring-loaded, bellows-actuated type that is used on
valves located in high radiation or high ambient

" temperature areas or in areas where both conditions
prevail. The operating piston and bellows are enclosed

312

in an airtight housing. The opening between the

operating stem and the bellows housing is sealed by a
stem seal bellows so that air pressure can be applied to
either one or both sides of the piston. This feature is
used to good advantage on valves located in the reactor
and drain tank cells, which operate at a slightly negative
pressure. Signal air pressure is applied to one side of the
bellows, and the other side is connected to the
atmosphere outside of the cells. Atmospheric pressure,
which remains relatively constant, becomes the reference
pressure. If the cell pressure is used as a reference, the
valve position would vary with cell pressure changes,
making precise control difficult. This operator is manu-
factured by The Annin Company.*:¢-7

The action of both types of operators is reversible, so
that each can be used for both fail-close, air-to-open
mode and fail-open, air-to-close mode applications.

Some of the operators are also equipped with position
switches as shown in Fig. 6.5.3.5 These switches are
actuated by the movement of the valve stem to operate
lamps on the control boards which indicate whether a
valve is open or closed. - | '

6.6 WEIGH SYSTEM
6.6.1 Introduction

An accurate measurement of the amount of salt in
each of the MSRE drain tanks is required for inventory
purposes and for safe operation of the reactor. Know-
ledge of the inventory of salt in each drain tank enables
the operator to determine the location as well as the
total inventory of salt. Such information is necessary
 

 

 

 

for keeping a running inventory ‘of the amount of
uranium in the system and is a valuable aid in

performance of fill, drain, and transfer operatlon Also, -
knowledge of individual tank inventories can be useful

in detecting system failures such as ruptures or leaks in
lmes or vessels.

" Individual tank inventories can be obtained by meas-
uring the level and correcting for density and vessel
geometry or by weighing the vessel and contents and
subtracting its tare weight. ‘The choice of system is
strongly influenced by the geometry and weight of the
vessel; by environmental conditions of temperature,
pressure, radiation, etc.; and by other considerations
such as remote maintenance requirements and the
effect of pipe loading on the apparent welght of the
vessel.

After considering the various factors involved, it was
decided that the highest accuracy could be obtained by
weighing the tanks.

6.6.2 System Description

6.6.2.1 General. Figure 6.6.1 shows a typical MSRE
tank support and weigh cell installation. Not shown in
Fig. 6.6.1 are the tank heaters and insulation. The
coolant tank and fuel storage tank heaters and insula-
tion are attached to the tank and constitute a part of
the tare weight of the tank. The fuel drain tanks and
the fuel flush tank are heated by an oven which rests on
the floor and does not contribute to the tare weight.
Steam domes are provided on the two fuel drain tanks
but.not on the coolant salt fuel flush and fuel storage
tanks. ‘As. shown in Table 6.6.1, the physical sizes and
weights .of the two fuel drain tanks are equal, but the
sizes and weights of the other tanks differ from those of
the fuel drain tanks and from each other. Otherwise,
the weigh systems used on the five tanks are identical.
~As:shown in Fig. 6.6.1, the tanks are hung in
suspension, and :their weights are supported by two

313

compressive-type pneumatic weigh cells,* which,
turn, are supported by vertlcal columns resting on the
cell floor.

Each drain tank is prowded with a support skirt
welded to the tank just above the upper head circumfer-
ential weld. Twelve stainless “steel hanger rods are
fastened by clevis-type couplings to this skirt and
suspend the tank from a support ring located at about
the elevation of the bottom of the steam drum. This has
two arms extending from it on opposite sides. Each of
these arms is suspended by three hanger bolts from a
pneumatic weigh cell resting on top of a support
column. Each of these two weigh cells has a point
support consisting of a bearing ball 3/4 in. in diameter.
The columns pass through holes in the arms on the
support ring with 1/4 in. clearance on a diameter, an
amount sufficient to allow proper operation of the
weigh cells, while at the same time the tank assembly is
prevented from falling off the two support points. The
long hanger bolts and the point support arrangement
reduce the horizontal loading on the weigh cells to a
negligible amount.

The .steam drum and bayonet assembly used on the
fuel drain tank assemblies also rests on the support ring
mentioned above and is thus a part of the total loading
indicated by the weigh cells.

To effect maintenance on a weigh cell or to remove a
drain tank or its cooling system, the weight of the drain
tank assembly must be removed from the weigh cells.
To accomplish this, the end of each support ring arm is
equipped with a jack bolt which operates against a
bracket on the supporting columns just below the arm.
A slight lifting of the arm by this bolt will permit
unthreading of the three hanger bolts on each weigh
cell. A collar is installed on each column just below the

arm onto which the weight of the assembly can be
lowered by backing off the jack bolts. _

The hanger bolt adjustments are also used to level the
support ring and extension arm assemnbly and the weigh
- cell base so that the tank will hang freely and so that
the applied force will be parallel to the center line of
the weigh cell. .

As stated previously, pneumatic weigh cells are'used
to measure the tank weights. This type of load cell was
selected for the following reasons:

1. It is of all-metallic construction and, therefore, is
immune to radiation effects or damage.

2. Tare load suppression may be accomplished re-
motely by adjustment of a pneumatic regulator.

3. The span accuracy may be checked externally by
varying the tare loading pressure and observing the
change in the live load signal.

4, The operation utilizes null balance principles and is,
therefore, free from zero or range shifts.

5. Operation of the cell may be checked remotely.

6. Compensation for ambient pressure variations is
provided by the addition of a reference pressure
connection on the tare regulator.

Although the calibration of the weigh cell is inher-
ently stable and can be checked remotely, the effects of
thermal expansion and pressure on pipe loading intro-
duce uncertainties in the zero (or tare) calibration of
the system.

The effects of pipe loading were minimized by the use
of long circular pipe runs in horizontal planes and by
careful attention to support and anchor points. Since
the effects of pipe loading could not be completely
eliminated, single-point level probes of the type de-
scribed in Sect. 6.10 were installed. These probes
provide a means of determining the level of one point in

the tank. When the level is maintained at this point, the -

weigh cell readings can be compared with readings
taken under similar conditions, and corrections can be
made for the effects of pipe loading.

6.6.2.2 Weigh cell construction. Figure 6.6.2 shows a
basic weigh cell having one live load and one tare load
area. The cell is cylindrical in shape and is composed of
stacked plates and rings bolted together to form an
outer case and a central load-sensitive support column.
The support column is positioned and supported by
diaphragms which also serve as flexure members and
divide the cell into three chambers. The lower chamber
is called the tare area, and the upper chamber is called
the live load or weighing area. The center chamber is
normally vented to the ambient pressure surrounding

the cell and is called the ambient area. The central
support column is free to move within limits in a
direction parallel to the .center line of the cell.
Application of weight (force) to the cell tank tends to
move the column toward the base plate, while an
increase of air pressure in the tare and weighing areas
tends to move the column away from the base plate.
This motion is restricted to £0.006 in. by internal limit
stops. A baffle-nozzle assembly is provided in the
weigh chamber. As explained below, this assembly
detects motion of the support column and maintains
the column position within £0.001 in. of a balanced
position. :

The weigh cells are of all-metallic construction.
Except for the bolts, the central column and the
portion of the outer case below the upper diaphragm
are aluminum. All other parts of the cell, including the
diaphragm, are steel. The diaphragm thickness is 0.003
in. -
The cell shown in Fig. 6.6.2 has a nominal effective
tare area of 45.5 in.? and a nominal effective weigh area
of 39.8 in. (The effective area is the difference in areas
of diaphragms above and below the chamber). Since the
internal pressure is limited by design to approximately
45 psi above ambient, the nominal tare capacity of this
cell is approximately 2000 lb, and the nominal live load
capacity is approximately 1500 lb. To obtain the
capacities required in the MSRE, additional diaphragm
stacks were added to the cells as shown in Fig. 6.6.3. By
proper interconnection of various areas the weigh and
tare areas can be effectively increased. The numbers of
stacks added vary with the cell capacity requirements.
The cell shown in Fig. 6.6.3 is used on all fuel drain,
flush, and storage tanks. It has a nominal capacity of
4000 1b tare and 6500 Ib live load. Effective tare and
live load areas are approximately 77 in.2 and 158 in.2
respectively. This is the largest cell used in the MSRE
and was the largest that the manufacturer had built. A
smaller cell with a nominal capacity of 1500 Ib tare and
4500 1b live load is used on the coolant drain tank. The
effective tare and live load areas of this cell are
approximately 40 and 118.5 in.? respectively.

6.6.2.3 Theory of operation. The basic weigh cell
system is shown schematically in Fig. 6.6.4. Air
pressure in the weighing chamber is automatically
adjusted to counterbalance the applied force minus the
force supplied by the tare chamber. This adjustment is
accomplished by means of an internal baffle-nozzle and
a remote pilot relay.

In the balanced condition, the normal flow of air is
through the jet, to the weighing area, and thence to
atmosphere through a bleed port provided in the
booster pilot valve. If the active load increases, the load
 

 

 

 

 

 

C

315

column moves toward the jet, causing an increase in the
jet line pressure. This actuates the booster pilot valve,

which then seals the bleed port and opens a poppet
valve, thus admitting high-pressure air into the weighing -

area. Sufficient air pressure is admitted until the
column moves away from the jet to reestablish the
balanced load condition. The weighing pressure is
proportional to the load applied. '

Pressure in the tare area is precisely controlled by
means of a manually adjustable regulator which is
referenced to the ambient pressure surrounding the
weigh cell. This ambient-pressure reference, together
with special piping connections and precision machining
of weigh cell components, provides a means of compen-
sating the weigh cell system for the effects of variations
in the pressure surrounding the weigh cell. Since the top
of the weigh cell must of necessity be referenced to
ambient pressure, the output of the weigh cell would be
a function of ambient pressure if all other pressures
were referenced to atmosphere. By connecting the
various areas as shown in Fig. 6.6.3, by maintaining
equal effective areas in the various chambers, by
referencing the tare regulator to ambient pressure, and
by referencing the pilot relay to atmospheric pressure,
the effect of ambient pressure is compensated. This
compensation is produced by the ambient-pressure-
dependent component of the tare pressure, which
produces a force that exactly counterbalances the
force on the top of the weigh cell produced by ambxent
pressure.

An alternate method of compensating for ambient
pressure would have been to reference all parts of the
system, including the pilot relay, to ambient pressure
and to correct the output for ambient pressure varia-
tion. This method could not be used in the MSRE
because air bleed from the pilot relay into the drain
tank cell could not be tolerated. :

6.6.2.4 Signal modification and readout. Fxgure 6.6.5
is a block diagram of the weigh system for fuel drain
tank 1, fuel drain tank 2, and the fuel flush tank. The
diagrams for the coolant drain tank and the fuel storage
tank systems are similar; however, in these installations,
the lines do not penetrate secondary contamment -and
block vavles are not required. - -

Four lines leave the weigh cells and penetrate contain-
ment. Cone-type remote disconnects are. provided in
these lines to permit removal of the weigh cells. Three
of the lines from each cell .connect to an associated
weigh panel in the transmitter room. The weigh panels
contain the ‘tare regulator, the pilot relay, a. tare
pressure indicator, and miscellaneous valves, filters, and

lines (see Fig. 6.6.4). The fourth line from the weigh
cell is vented in the transmitter room and provides
the atmospheric-pressure reference. A single line, vented
inside containment, provides the ambient reference
pressure to the tare pressure regulators in both weigh
panels as well as to the corresponding regulators in
weigh panels for drain tank 2 and the fuel flush tank.
The line also provides an ambient-pressure reference
pressure to one side of the tare pressure manometer
when the manually operated tare pressure selector
switch is in the FD1, FD2, or FFT position. This switch
is ganged with another switch, which connects the other
side of the tare manometer to tare pressure outputs of
the weigh panels. The pressure read on the tare
manometers is therefore the difference between the

' ambient pressure and the tare pressure. This differential

pressure does not vary with ambient pressure and is set
to produce a 3-psig live load signal output from the
weigh panels when the tanks are empty.

All lines penetrating containment are provided with
block valves which are instrumented to close if the
pressure inside secondary containment exceeds +2 psig
(see Sect. 1.5).

When the tare pressures are correctly set, the live and
tare pressures are as shown in Table 6.6.2.

The signal pressures from either weigh cells on fuel
drain tank 1 or on any of the other tanks can be selected
by means of a manually operated se!ector‘ switch and
measured accurately on a manometer which is per-
manently provided for this purpose. These signal
pressures are also. converted to industry standard
pressures (3 to 15 psig) and averaged to form a single 3-
to 15-psig pneumatic signal which is fed to a recorder on
the main board and to a strain-gage-type pressure
transducer (pneumatic-to-electric converter). The O-to
25-mV dc output of the pressure transducer is connected
to one input of the computer data logger. To provide an
adjustable high-level alarm the averaged signal pressure
is alsa fed to an adjustable-set-pomt pneumatic switch,
which is basically a conventional proportlonal con-
troller set for zero proportional band so as to give
on-off (binary) action. This controller is integrally

-mounted with the recorder. When the averaged signal is

above set point the output of the controller is zero, and
when it is below set point the output is 20 psig. A
conventional ‘pressure switch detects the state of the
controller and actuates an annunciator on the main
control board when the level is high.

The signals from weigh cells on other tanks are also
modified, recorded, and alarmed in'a manner identical
to that described above for fuel drain tank 1.

A factory calibration curve for one of the fuel drain
tank weigh cells is shown in Fig. 6.6.6. The results
obtained in this calibration are typical of those ob-
tained in other calibrations.

6.7 THERMOCOUPLE SYSTEMS

6.7.1 General

The most extensive and possibly the most important
process measurement made in the MSRE is tempera-
ture. With a few exceptions, all high-temperature
measurements are made with Inconel-sheathed, mineral-
insulated Chromel-Alumel thermocouples. There are
over 1100 thermocouples in the MSRE system. Approx-
imately one-third of these are associated with the
fuel-salt system, and about one-third are associated with
the coolant-salt system. The remainder are associated
with the off-gas system and with auxiliary systems such
as fuel processing, cooling water, and lube oil. About
 

 

 

 

 

half of the couples are located inside secondary
containment. Most of the couples measure temperatures
in the range of 900 to 1300°F. The majority of the
couples were installed for the putpose of monitoring
sections of pipe and vessels heated by external electrical
heaters.

Design of the MSRE thermocouple system presented
problems of selection, procurement, fabrication, and
inspection of thermocouple materials, hot junctions,
attachments, cold end seals, disconnects, lead wire, and
containment penetration. Although the state of the art
of temperature measurement with thermocouples was
highly developed at the start of the MSRE design and
most of the information required was available from
ORNL experience or from the literature, considerations
of environment, reliability, and compatibility with
remote maintenance concepts and containment criteria
generated requirements not found in more conventional
installations. e

An effort was made to use known techmques and
materials wherever possible; however, in areas where the
existing technology was inadequate, development of
new devices and techniques was required. In many cases
this development consisted of modification of existing
techniques. In other cases, such as fabrication of
attachment, hot junctions, cold end seals, disconnects,
and containment penetration seals, considerable devel-
opment effort was required. In all cases, new develop-
ment items were thoroughly tested under laboratory
and field conditions before installation in the MSRE.

6.7.2 System Description

6.7.2.1 Overall system. The block diagram of the
MSRE temperature measurement system, Fig. 6.7.1,
shows the distribution of thermocouple measurements
in the various MSRE systems, the methods of readout,
and the routing of the interconnecting thermocouple
lead wire.

‘Most_of the thermocouples are. routed to a central
patch panel. Inputs of the readout instrumentation are
also routed to the patch panel, and interconnection of
the thermocouples and readout instrumentation is made
" with removable patch cords. This arrangement per-
mitted the design and installation to proceed before
final assignment of the readout was determined and
presently permits revisions of readout assignment to be
* made without the necessxty of changes in permanent
wiring.

With a few exceptions, all thermocouples connected |

to the computer data logger and to all readout

instrumentation located in the main and auxiliary
control room are routed through the patch panel.

- Thermocouples associated with the safety system
were not routed through the patch panel, because to do
so would violate the criteria of separation of control
and safety systems and because of the possibility that
the safety system might be inadvertently disabled
during routine operations.

-In those cases where the thermocouples were needed
only for localized control or monitoring of auxiliary
equipment, the thermocouple was connected directly to
field-mounted instrumentation and was not routed
through the patch panel.

Most of the thermocouple signals are read out on the
computer data logger, the thermocouple scanner, and
the magnetic-amplifier-type single-point temperature
switches. These instruments are discussed in Sects. 2.12,
6.14, and 6.15. Other signals are read out on standard
commercially available recorders, indicators, and indi-
cator-controllers. Signals from safety system thermo-
couples are amplified and converted to a 10- to 50-mA
signal which is used to ‘operate other components of the
safety system. Foxboro ECl-type emf-to-current con-
verters are used for this conversion.

6.7.2.2 Fuel-salt system. Approximately 414 thermo-
couples. are installed on components of the fuel-salt
system.* Of these, 354 are installed on pipe and vessel
surfaces, 20 are installed in the fuel drain tank
bayonets, and 40 are installed on the reactor vessel
access plug and nozzle. The distribution of these
thermocouples is about equally divided between the
reactor cell and the drain tank cell, with 204 being
located in the reactor cell and 210 located in the drain
tank cell. All thermocouple assemblies, disconnects,
lead wire, and containment penetrations in these areas
are designed to withstand high-level nuclear radiation
and high ambient temperature, and with a few excep-
tions the couples are all ‘weld-attached. Figure 6.7.2
shows a typical installation for a pipe-mounted thermo-
couple. The thermocouple is a mineral-insulated,
Inconel-sheathed assembly attached to .the pipe by
means of an INOR-8 lug. The thermocouple is routed
along the pipe for a short distance to minimize errors
resulting from heat conduction and is then routed to
the removable half of a remotely operable discornect
located outside the high-temperature zone. With a few
exceptions all disconnects in the feactor and drain tank
cells are multipin devices that will disconnect six

and on the fuel transfer line (see Sect. 6.7.2.7).

 
 

 

 

thermocouples at a time. An effort was made to assign
all thermocouples connected to a given disconnect to
the same system component so that the component
could be removed and reinstalled with all thermo-
couples attached. In the few cases where this was not
possible, single-circuit remotely operated disconnects
were installed between the thermocouple element and
the multicircuit disconnect. Multiconductor thermo-
couple extension lead cable is used to connect those
disconnects associated with control-grade thermo-
couples to junction box terminals located outside of
containment and biological shielding. The multiconduc-
tor cable consists of six fiber-glass-insulated thermo-
couple pairs in a %4-in.-OD copper tube. Since this cable
penetrates the containment vessel and since the glass
insulation can become hygroscopic after irradiation,
seals are provided at both ends of the cable and at the
point of containment vessel penetration. To further
ensure containment and to provide a means of leak
detection, provisions were made for continuous pres-
surization of the cables with nitrogen at 50 psig. To
provide additional reliability and the required physical
and electrical separation, standard stainless-steel-
sheathed, mineral-insulated Chromel-Alumel thermo-
couple material was used to connect disconnects associ-
ated with safety-grade thermocouples to the external
junction box terminals. In these installations the inter-
nal magnesium oxide pack is sufficient to ensure
containment, and gas pressurization was neither neces-
sary nor practical. Although end seals were not required
on these cables for containment purposes, both ends
were sealed to prevent absorption of moisture.
Thermocouples attached to exterior surfaces of the
reactor vessel, drain tanks, heat-exchanger and pump-
bowl freeze flanges, and freeze valves are fabricated and
installed in a manner similar to that described above for
piping installations. Thermocouple installations in the
fuel drain tank bayonet tube assemblies and on the
reactor vessel access nozzle are similar to the piping
installations insofar as thermocouple fabrication and
routing of -thermocouple and lead wire exterior to the
vessels are concerned; however, due to space limita-
tions, the installation of the couples in the vessel was
more difficult, and special techniques were required.
Figure 6.7.3 'shows a bayonet tube thermocouple
assembly. One assembly of this type is installed in each
of the two fuel drain tanks for the purpose of
measuring the vertical profile of temperature inside the
tanks. This assembly consists of a type 304 stainless
steel tube into which ten thermocouples are inserted
and attached to the tube wall at five elevations. The
attachment is made by inserting and furnace brazing the

 

318

tip of the thermocouple into a sleeve and button
assembly that is subsequently welded to the tube wall
at a right angle to the tube. This arrangement holds the
thermocouple at the proper elevation, permits the
thermocouple tip to be flush with the outer wall of the
tube, and accommodates differences in the thermal
expansion of the thermocouple sheath and the tube
wall. To minimize heat losses the tube was packed with
Fiberfrax insulation. The bayonet assembly is inserted
into a thimble in the drain tank and does not contact
the salt directly. A cover plate and handle assembly,
welded to the top of the bayonet tube, supports the
tube and provides a means of insertion and removal.

Figure 6.7.4 shows the locations of thermocouples in
the reactor access nozzle, and Fig. 6.7.5 shows the
routing of a typical couple. To determine the tempera-
ture distribution in the frozen salt seal between the
nozzle and plug, 14 thermocouples are installed at four
elevations on the outside of the nozzle walls and on the

_inside of the plug wall. Twelve additional thermo-

couples are installed at two elevations on the outer
walls of the control rod thimbles, and three thermo-
couples are installed at two elevations on the outer
walls of the graphite sampler thimble. One thermo-
couple is installed in a well in the graphite sampler plug
assembly for the purpose of measuring temperature in
the salt stream at the reactor outlet. The access nozzle
and graphite sampler plug assemblies were designed to
permit all thermocouples to be installed outside of
containment walls. Thus no thermocouple penetration
of containment was required. The major problem with
these installations was the attachment of thermocouples
in locations where space was limited and routing of
thermocouples through a congested area. All thermo-
couples in the plug assemblies are brought to remotely
operable disconnects located above and attached to the
assembly (see Fig. 6.7.6). The disconnects are con-
nected to other permanent-mounted disconnects by
means of a removable jumper cable.

6.7.2.3 Coolant salt system. Approximately 417 ther-
mocouples are installed on components of the coolant
salt system. Of these, 259 are installed on pipe and
vessel surfaces, 122 are installed on the radiator tubes,
28 are installed on other surfaces within the radiator,
and 8 are installed on surfaces of the radiator cooling
air ducts. ‘

-

In addition to the thermocouples, resistance témpera-
ture detectors are provided for measurement of the rise
in temperature in the air passing through the radiator.
These detectors are located in the main air duct
upstream of the radiator and near the stack outlet.

 
 

 

 

To obtain an accurate measurement of the difference
in temperature of the coolant salt entering and leaving
the radiator, six thermocouples are installed in wells
located in the main loop piping upstream and down-
stream of the radiator.

With the exception of those thermocouples installed
in wells and on the radiator tubing, all thermocouples in
the coolant salt system are fabricated and installed in a

manner similar to that of the fuel-salt system thermo-

couples described previously. However, since the radia-
tion level in the coolant-salt cells is low during
shutdown and relatively low during operation and since
the major portion of the system is not enclosed by a
containment vessel, remote maintenance capabilities
and radiation-resistant materials were not required.*
Thermocouples attached to pipes and vessels in this area

were, therefore, terminated in standard (manually

operated) single-circuit disconnects at a short distance
outside of the pipe or vessel insulation, and standard
polyvinyl-insulated lead wire was used beyond the
disconnect (see Fig. 6.7.7).

The 120 thermocouple located on the outlet ends of
the radiator tubes were attached with specially devel-
oped band-type clamps and routed to junction box
terminals located in the coolant cell outside the radiator
enclosure and cooling air duct (see Fig. 6.7.8). Other
thermocouples inside the radiator enclosure, such as
those ‘on hangers and supports, were attached by
welding and routed to either the coolant cell junction
box previously mentioned or to junction boxes located
in the area above the radiator enclosure. Because of the
prevailing high ambient temperature, high-temperature

(fiber-glass) insulation was required on all lead wire and
terminal strips in this area. Standard polyvinyl-insulated -

lead wire was used beyond the junction boxes outside
the radiator enclosure and high ambient zones; how-
ever, the polyvinyl was stripped from the section of

lead wire inside the junction box and replaced thh'

~ ceramic beads. .

All thermocouples within the radiator are' ‘mineral-
insulated, Inconel-sheathed assemblies. Since the radia-
tor enclosure is essentially an oven and since the
temperatures within this oven can be as high as 1300°F
"when the doors are closed, the use of disconnects
within the enclosure was not desirable. Instead, -the
thermocouples in this area were run continuously from

the point of attachment -to the -junction boxes or
disconnects outside of the enclosure. As a result, some

 

*Thermocouples associated with the part of the coolant-salt
system inside the reactor cell are fabricated and installed in the
same manner as the fuelsalt system thermaocouples.

319

radiator thermocouples are as long as 18% ft. Since
most of this length is heated and since the resistance of
magnesium oxide decreases exponentially with tempera-
ture, high-quality insulation and adequate insulation
thickness were required to avoid significant errors
resulting from electrical leakage between wires and
between wires and the sheath. This consideration also

_applied to other long installations, such as on the

reactor vessel and fuel drain tanks, and was one of the
main reasons why sheath diameters smaller than % in
were not generally used in the MSRE.

Thermocouples installed in the radiator cooling air
ducts were weld-attached and routed through the duct
walls and fitted with single disconnects. Extension lead
wire from these disconnects was routed to a junction
box in the coolant cell. These thermocouples are similar
in construction to the thermocouples attached to
hangers and supports in the radiator but are not
generally exposed to such high temperatures. Standard
polyvinyl-insulated lead wire was used in these installa-
tions beyond the disconnects.

6.7.2.4 Off-gas system. Fourteen of the thlrty -two
off-gas system thermocouples are located in the char-
coal beds, one is in the volume tank inside the charcoal
bed containment vessel, three measure water tempera-
ture inside the charcoal bed containment vessel, nine
are located on the particle trap and charcoal filter, two
are located on the gas holdup cooler, and three are
located on gas letdown lines. One of the three letdown
couples is located on line 522 near the letdown valve,
one is located on the upper gas letdown line from the
fuel-salt circulating pump, and one is located on a
similar line from the coolant-salt circulating pump. With
the ‘exception of those couples installed on the particle
trap, the gas holdup cooler, and in the charcoal bed
cooling water, all off-gas system thermocouples were

" installed in wells. Since the off-gas system temperatures
~are relatively low, all thermocouples in this area were

fabricated from 310 stamless-steel-sheathed material

~ obtained from ORNL stores.

Figures ‘6.7.9 and 6.7.10 show the location and
routing of thermocouples installed -inside the charcoal
bed containment vessel installation. All thermocouples
l6cated inside containment are routed into a thermo-
couple containment junction box located at top center
of the charcoal bed containment vessel with no breaks
in the sheath between the hot junction and the junction
boxes. Compression-type ‘tube fittings were used to seal
the thermocouple penetration of the junction box. This

- arrangement provides the required containment as well

as' protection from the effects of the humid environ-
ment existing in the water-filled- containment vessel.
 

 

 

 

Charcoal bed thermocouples are inserted in wells as
shown in Fig. 6.7.11. The couples in the volume tank
were installed in the same manner except that the
stainless steel wool trap was omitted. Cooling water
couples are immersed directly in water and strapped to
lines for support. Individual disconnects, provided on
each couple inside the junction box, connect the

320

couples to fiber-glass-insulated lead wire which extends

to a junction box located outside the high radiation
area, in the vent house. Standard polyvinyl-insulated
lead wire was used beyond the vent house junction box.

Thermocouples installed on the particle trap are weld

attached in a manner similar to the installations
previously described for heated pipes and vessels.
Charcoal filter thermocouples are installed in wells. To
permit remote maintenance or removal of the particle
trap. or charcoal bed, all thermocouples on these
components are routed to remotely operable discon-
nects. : :
Except for six couples located on letdown lines and
on the volume tank and gas holdup cooler, all off-gas
system thermocouples terminate in a patch panel in the
vent house. These couples may be read out on
instruments located in the vent house and are not
presently connected to the main patch panel.

6.7.2.5 Cover gas system. Except for five line-
mounted couples, all thermocouples in the cover gas
system are installed in or on components of the oxygen
removal helium dryer and helium preheater systems.

Figure 6.7.12 shows the oxygen removal unit installa-
tions. Temperatures of the internal titanium getter are
measured and controlled with Y, 4-in.-OD mineral-
insulated, stainless-steel-sheathed couples inserted
through Conax glands into grooves in the heaters. The
Conax gland provides a seal at the point of vessel
penetration. Gas temperatures above the getter are
measured by a shorter ¥, 4-in.-OD couple installed in
the same manner. Temperatures at the inlet of the
getter are measured with a % -in.-OD mineral-insulated,
stainless-steel-sheathed couple inserted in a well at the
bottom of the unit. To provide signals for protection
against overheating, two couples are attached to the
outer wall of the unit beneath the external heaters.
These couples are weld attached in a manner similar to
~ that described for.the heated salt systems. All couples
on the helium dryer and helium preheater systems are
similarly attached to outside walls and used for heater
control and overheat protection.

The five line-mounted couples are attached with
mechanical band-type clamps. Temperature information
obtained from these installations is used for flow
correction and other operational purposes.

With the exception of the three Y ¢-in.-OD couples
installed in each of the oxygen removal units, all
thermocouples in the cover gas system are Y%-in.-OD
mineral-insulated, stainless-steel-sheathed assemblies
obtained from ORNL stores. Individual (manually
operated) disconnects were provided on all couples, and
polyvinyl-insulated lead wire was run from the discon-
nect directly to the readout instrument. All cover gas
system readout instrumentation is installed in field
panels located in the diesel house.

1 6.7.2.6 Cooling water system. Fourteen thermo-
couples are used to measure temperatures in the cooling
water system. With the exception of the charcoal bed
cooling water installations described previously, all
cooling water system thermocouples are standard com-
mercially available bayonet-type assemblies, installed in
wells. Since temperatures in this system are low and
environmental conditions are not severe, conventional
materials and practices were used throughout, and no
special techniques were required. In addition to the
thermocouple measurements, nine temperature meas-
urements are made locally with seven dial-type tempera-
ture indicators, one bulb-type temperature indicator-
controller, and one temperature switch. These sensors
are also installed in wells.

6.7.2.7 Fuel processing system. Approximately 71
thermocouples are installed on salt-containing heated
pipes and vessels in the fuel processing cell. These
thermocouples are installed in same manner as de-
scribed for the coolant-salt system. An additional 69
thermocouples are installed in other parts of the fuel
processing system. These installations are conventional
in most cases and are described in Sect. 3.13,

6.7.2.8 Miscellaneous. Thirty-six thermocouples are
used to measure ambient temperatures at various
locations in the containment cells and operational areas.
Except for those installed in the reactor and drain tank
cells, conventional practices and materials were used in
these installations. In the reactor and drain cells,
stainless-steel-sheathed, mineral-insulated couples were
connected to extra terminals on multicircuit remotely
operable disconnects and installed so that no supports
were near the tip of the couple.

Two thermocouples measure water and vapor tem-
peratures in the vapor condensing system. These ther-
mocouples are installed in wells. Standard materials and
practices were used in the fabrication and installation of
these couples. |

Winding temperatures in the lube oil pump motors are
measured by four thermocouples (one on-each motor)
embedded in the winding.
 

 

o

Temperatures of lubricating and céo]mg ol entering
and leaving the fuel- and coolant-salt circulating pump
motors and thermal shields are measured with 12
thermocouples installed at six locations on oil inlet and
outlet lines. Inlet temperatures are measured on each
system at a point just downstream of the oil pumps by
couples installed in wells. Outlet temperatures are
measured by thermocouples mechanically clamped to
the pipe in a manner similar to that described for the
radiator tube installations. The four couples on the
fuel-salt circulating pump oil outlet lines are located in
the reactor cell and are routed to a remotely operable
disconnect.

Two mechanically clamped thermocouples attached
to external lines measure the component-coolant-pump
lubricating oil.

Three thermocouples, installed in wells, measure the
temperature of air entering and leaving the component
coolant pumps.

Four thermocouples inserted into drilled holes, meas-
ure the temperature of the main blower bearings.

Except where specific mention has been made above,
standard materials and practices were used for all
applications discussed in this section, -

couples numerically, identifies the readout instrument,

nal assignment. Other pertinent information is also
given in a remark column, in notes, and on figures.

6.7.3 Basic Thermocouple Assemblies

The basic thermocouple assembly used in almost all
MSRE installations consists of sheathed, magnesium
oxide-insulated Chromel-Alumel wire material, cut to
the required length and provided with seals.at both ends
and a junction of the Chromel and Alumel wire at the

hot (or measurement) end. The purpose of the seals is

to prevent absorption of moisture.

Figure 6.7.13 shows six basic types of thermocouple
assemblies. Welded closures are provided at the hot ends
of all thermocouples. Inside the fuel and drain tank
cells, where the radiation level is high, the cold ends are
sealed with an inorganic sealant. In areas where radia-

. tion levels are low, the cold ends are sealed with organic

materials. With the exception of those thermocouples

used to measure the differential temperature across the

coolant-salt radiator and a few couples on a resistance-
heated section of the fuel drain line, all hot juﬂCt!OﬂS in

“the MSRE are grounded. _
~ All thermocouple assemblies attached to hedted plpes

and vessels containing molten salt are Inconel-sheathed.
Other assemblies are stainless-steel-sheathed.

321

All MSRE thermocouple assemblies except those
associated with safety systems are fabricated from
duplex wire material; that is, the Chromel and Alumel
wires are contained in one sheath. To provide a means
of detecting detached thermocouples, the safety system
assemblies were fabricated from individually sheathed
Chromel and Alumel wires. In these installations the
thermocouple junction is formed through the pipe or
vessel wall, and the sheath is insulated from ground.

Common sources of failure in sheathed assemblies are
wire breakage at the hot junction and leakage of
moisture through pinholes or cracks in the hot and cold
end seals. The probability of failure at the hot junction
is increased significantly when the thermocouples are
operated at high temperature and/or are subjected to
fast temperature transients. Because of the large num-
ber of thermocouples in the MSRE system, a high
degree of reliability for individual thermocouples was
required to ensure continuity of operations. In par-
ticular, high reliability was needed for those couples
that are operated at high temperatures or are located in
inaccessible areas (such as the fuel and drain cells)
where replacement is difficult. To ensure that a high
degree of reliability was obtained, close attention was
paid to detail in the procurement of materials and in
the fabrication of thermocouple assemblies.

Where requirements were not severe and lengths were
less than 3 ft, standard thermocouple assemblies (de-
scribed in paragraph 6.7.11.2) were used. Where re-
quirements were severe and where lengths exceeded 3
ft, thermocouple assemblies were fabricated in ORNL
shops using material described in paragraph 6.7.11.3
and the procedures discussed below. ORNL shop
fabrication was necessary in these cases because, at the
time, the fabrication procedures were developmental in
nature and in many cases the required lengths could not
be determined sufficiently in advance to permit fabrica-
tion outside ORNL. A by-product of this in-house
fabrication was that short assemblies needed in areas
such as the coolant-salt system could be fabricated from
scrap materials left over after fabrication of the longer
assemblies. '

6.7.4 Thermocouple Hot Junction Fabrication

6.7.4.1 Standard assemblies. Standard assembly hot
junctions were vendor-fabricated in accordance with the
procedures specified in ORNL Specification IS-124 (see
paragraph 6.7.11.2). : '

6.7.4.2 Special assembhes Spec1ai assembly hot junc-
tions were fabricated in ORNL shops in accordance
with the following procedures.
 

 

 

Duplex grounded-junction assemblies. The end of the
sheathed material was dressed so that the Chromel and
Alumel wires were flush with the end of the sheath. A
small piece of filler rod material having a composition
appropriate for the sheath material was placed against
the end and fused to the wires and the sheath using the
tungsten-inert-gas process.* The completed closures
were then dye penetrant inspected and radiographed in
two directions, each 90° apart and perpendicular to the
thermocouple axis. The radiography procedure is de-
scribed in ORNL Specification IS-124. Dye penetra-
tions were made in accordance with ORNL Specifica-
tion MET-NDT-4.

Duplex insulated-junction assemblies. The procedure
for fabrication of %-in.-OD insulated (ungrounded)
junction assemblies was the same as that of the
grounded junction except that before the end closure
was made, magnesium oxide insulation was removed to
a depth of approximately % ¢ in. by air blasting. A
junction of the Chromel and Alumel wires was formed,
at a distance of approximately 0.030 in. from the end
of sheath, by fusing with a tungsten arc in an inert gas
atmosphere.t Magnesium oxide was then packed
around the junction, and the end closure was welded
and inspected as described above.

Single-wire safety-system assemblies. The hot end
closure of the safety-system assemblies was fabricated
in the same manner as the duplex grounded-junction
assemblies. However, in these assemblies the actual
thermocouple junction was formed when the thermo-
couples were attached to the pipe or vessel.

6.7.5 Thermocouple Cold End Seals

After fabrication and inspection of the hot junction,
thermocouples that were to be located in high radiation
areas were sealed with a water mix glaze compound
(Physical Science Corporation, formula 0900). The
0900 glaze compound was applied to the end of the
assembly in a paste form before baking and after
removal of a small amount of the magnesium oxide

 

*Although the thermocouple material was baked by the seller
to remove moisture and checked for low insulation resistance at
ORNL after receipt, additional wire-to-wire and wire-to-ground
resistance measurements were made before the hot junction
fabrication because the presence of moisture in the insulation
can cause blowout of the weld and result in unsatisfactory hot
end seals. Material found to have low insulation resistance was
rebaked to remove the moisture.

TSee Fig. 7.26 (insulated junction) for general dimensions and
details of insulated-junction thermocouples.

322

- insulation by air blasting. The thermocouple assemblies

were then baked in a tube furnace for a minimum of 16
hr at 250 to 350°F to remove all moisture from the
magnesium oxide insulation and 0900 glaze compound.
After baking out moisture, the compound was cured for
16 to 20 min at 1550°F and then slowly cooled to
room temperature. The resultant seal was helium
leak-tight, radiation resistant, and capable of operating
at temperatures up to 1750°F. Thermocouples that
were to be located in low radiation were sealed with
heat-shrink tubing after baking. The heat-shrink tubing
seal was formed by slipping a short length of irradiated
polyvinyl chloride tubing, having an inside diameter
slightly larger than the sheath, over the end of the
sheath and part of the wires and heating with a
hair-dryer hot air blower. After the tubing had shrunk
tightly around the sheath and before it had cooled, the
tubing was crimped around the wire with pliers. Test
seals made in this manner were found to be helium

- leak-tight with 100 psig internal pressure. The heat-

shrink tubing used for these seals was made by Rayclad
Tubes, Inc. |

Cold ends of standard thermocouple assemblies were
sealed with epoxy in accordance with the requirement
of ORNL Specification IS-124.

6.7.6 Methods of Attachment

6.7.6.1 General. The attachment of thermocouples to
INOR-8 pipes and vessels required special attention, and
considerable effort was spent in developing and testing
thermocouple  attachments. Developmental tests
showed that welded attachments would be desirable in
those applications where the couples were attached to
heated pipes and vessels and where high accuracy
and/or reliability was required. The use of welded
attachments, however, presented problems in maintain-
ing the structural and metallurgical integrity of the pipe
or vessel wall at the point of attachment and in
inspection of the weld attachment. These problems
were solved in a variety of ways, with the particular
solution being dependent on the application. For
example, the possibility of diffusion of dissimilar metals
into pipe and vessel walls, which would have occurred if
the Inconel sheath or the Chromel and Alumel wires
were welded directly to INOR-8 walls, was avoided by
welding an INOR-8 tab to the hot junction end of a
mineral-insulated, Inconel-sheathed thermocouple in
the shop and subsequently welding the INOR-8 tab to
the pipe or vessel wall in the field. Thermocouple
attachments to components of the primary. fuel salt
system were made by first laying down a pad of
 

 

INOR-8 weld metal, inspecting the ‘weld, and then
welding the tab to the pad. This technique permitted
the detection of weld cracks before attachment of the
thermocouple. Although a. possibility exists that un-
detected cracks were produced in the pad when the
thermocouple was attached, these cracks are not ex-
pected to propagate from the pad to the pipe or vessel
wall. The use of weld pads was limited to portions of
the MSRE where the consequences of failure are severe.
In areas, such as the coolant-salt system, where the

consequences of component failure are less severe,

attachments were made directly to the pipe or vessel
walls, and the remote possibility of the existence of
undetected weld cracks was accepted.

Because of the possibility of penetrating or otherwise

damaging the thin-walled radiator tubes, thermocouples

were attached to these tubes with specially developed
band-type clamps instead of by welding. Since the
-conduction of heat to band-attached couples is inher-
ently poorer than to the weld-attached couples and
since the radiator couples are located in a moving air
stream, special precautions were required in the design
of these attachments to avoid excessive errors.

As a general rule the use of thermocouple wells was
avoided on lines and vessels containing molten salt
because of the possibility of mechanical failure. How-
ever, to obtain an accurate measurement of the dif-
ference in temperature of coolant salt entering and
leaving the radiator, wells were installed in the main
loop piping upstream and downstream of the radiator.
Also, to measure the temperature in the fuel salt stream
at the reactor outlet, a well was installed in the graphite
sampler plug assembly. In other MSRE systems, where
the consequence of mechanical failure is less severe,
wells are used more extensively. This is particularly true
in the cooling water system, where all but three are
installed in wells.

6.7.6.2 Surface welded .attachments Welded attach-.

ments were used for all surface temperature measure-
ments on INOR-8 pipes and vessels other than the
radiator tubing. Figure 6.7.14 shows typlcal surface
welded attachments. The attachments were made by
welding INOR-8 metal tabs to the Inconel sheath in the
shop and subsequently welding the tab to the pipe or

vessel. The .tabs are Y in. wide and approximately the

~ same thickness as the sheath wall (0.010 in. for
' 6-in.-OD and 0.015 in. for Y%-in.-OD sheath) and are

formed to fit closely around the thermocouple sheath |

with a lug(or lugs) extending to the side (or sides) for a
distance of approximately %;, in. The tabs were welded
to the thermocouples, using the inert-gas-shielded tung-
sten arc process, after fabrication and inspection of the

323 -

hot junction and hot end closure. To perform this weld,
the tube was placed flush with the hot end of the
thermocouple, and the tab .was joined to the previous
weldment around the periphery of the sheath, in a
single pass. No weld was made on the side of the tab
away from the end of the couple. Considerable care and
skill was required in this operation to prevent burning

"through the thin-wall sheath or damaging the previously

fabricated hot junction and end closure. Chill blocks
were used to prevent overheating of portions of the
assembly other than those being welded. Such overheat-
ing can result in wire breakage due to excessive stress or
blowout of the weld due to expansion of gas or residual
moisture inside the sheath. After the tab weldment was

completed, the hot end of the assembly was dye

penetrant inspected and radiographed again using the
procedures discussed in paragraph 6.7.4.

Two methods were used for attachment of the
thermocouple assemblies to INOR-8 pipes and vessels.

Coolant-salt system thermocouples were attached
directly to the pipe or vessel with small fillet welds at
the edge of the tab. These welds were visually inspected
in accordance with the requirements of Sect. 13 of
ORNL Specification MET-WR-200.

All thermocouple attachments to components of the |

fuel salt system in the reactor, drain tank, and fuel
storage cells were made by first laying down a pad of
INOR-8 weld metal and then welding the tabs to the
pad. Single weld tabs were used where the wall
thickness was % in. or less. Double wing tabs were used
on thicker sections. The pads were made as small as was
possible and still accommodate the thermocouple tab.
The pads have surface -dimensions of approximately %

X % in. for double wing tabs and ¥%¢ X % in. for
smgle tabs and a thickness of one weld bead (¥, 4 to %

‘in.). The pad surfaces were hand filed where required to

obtain a smooth ‘contour which was flat enough to
allow the entire thermocouple tab to be placed against

it. Care was taken to prevent the tab weldment from

extending to the thermocouple sheath or to the INOR-8

“base metal. Where practical, an inert atmosphere was

used inside the pipe or vessel during welding. Where this
was not practical, a visual and penetrant inspection of

the area in the vicinity of the weld was made on .

completion of the weld. All welding was done in
accordance with ORNL Spec1ﬁcat10n PS-25, using the
inert-gas-shielded tungsten-arc process. Before attach-
ment of the thermocouple, all pads were liquid pene-
trant inspected in accordance with ORNL Specification
MET-NDT-4. Those pads that were located on surfaces
having a thickness of less than %; in. were radiographed
in accordance with ORNL Specification MET-NDT-S.
 

 

 

Mechanical attachments were used at locations other
than the hot junction where possible. Where welded
attachments were required at these locations, pads were
provided. |

6.7.6.3 Surface clamped attachments. Figure 6.7.15
shows the method of attachment of thermocouples
located on the thin-walled radiator tubing. These band
attachments were specially designed to hold the ther-
mocouple in close contact with the tubing at operating
temperature and after repeated thermal cycling. The
band is made of ¥ ¢-in.-wide, 0.020-in.-thick Inconel
attached to the sheath near the hot end seal with
gold-nickel brazing alloy. To maintain the close toler-
ances required for satisfactory attachment, the bands
were formed in the shop using a hand-operated die. The
brazing operation was also performed in the shop. To
maintain maximum heat transfer between the tube and
the thermocouple, the braze joint is contoured to fit
closely around the thermocouple sheath.

As shown in Fig. 6.7.15, the thermocouple attach-
ment was made by placing the upper section of the
band over the tube, engaging the lower section, and
- crimping. The crimping action draws the band tight
around the tube and locks the upper and lower sections
together.

To improve accuracy by reducing heat loss into the
air stream, the thermocouple was insulated in the region
of the hot junction. The thermocouple shown at the far
right of Fig. 6.7.15 is insulated with Fiberfrax paper,
and the thermocouple second from right is insulated
with Fiberfrax board. Both forms performed satisfac-
torily in test. The paper form was used in the MSRE
because it required no machining or preforming prior to
installation. The insulation consists of multiple layers of
Y5-in. Fiberfrax paper held in place by 0.005-in.-thick
Inconel sheet metal, bent around the insulation and
tubing, notched in the region of the thermocouple
band, and joined with a “pan lock™ seam similar to that
used on the thermocouple band clamp.

Figure 6.7.16 shows some of the actual installations

in the MSRE radiator.
~ 6.7.6.4 Well installations. Figure 6.7.17 shows the
construction of the wells used for measurement of the
coolant salt radiator inlet and outlet temperature. The
design of these wells was analyzed to determine the
effects of flow-induced vibrations,>* and prototypes
were installed and operated in a pump test facility
before installation in the reactor.

Other types of well installations are shown in Fig.
6.7.4,6.7.11, and 6.7.12.

Wells used in the cooling water system were either
standard commercially available assemblies or were
fabricated on-site using standard pipe fittings.

6.7.7 Disconnects

Figure 6.7.18 shows a six-circuit disconnect of the
type used in the reactor and drain tank cells. This
disconnect is a modification of a standard Thermo
Electric Company disconnect and is constructed of
radiation- and heat-resistant materials. As shown in Fig.
6.7.19, individual mineral-insulated thermocouples are
connected to female pins in the removable upper

section of the disconnect. Not shown in the photograph

are the ceramic beads used to insulate individual wires
between the thermocouple end seal and the disconnect
terminals. In most installations, a multiconductor ex-
tension lead cable is connected to the male pins in the
lower (fixed) section (see Fig. 6.7.2). However, in
safety system disconnects, the leads are brought out to
individual (single circuit) mineral-insulated lead-wire
cables in a manner similar to that of the upper section.
Safety disconnects also have divider partitions to
maintain channel separation.

The plug and jack panels were supplied by the
Thermo Electric Company and are similar to their
standard assemblies except for the insulating material,
which is Electrobestos. The housings are similar in
construction and size to FS-type conduit boxes and
were supplied by the Adalet Manufacturing Company.
The jack housing (top half) has a removable back plate
to facilitate wiring connection. Swage-type compression
tube fittings are utilized to support and restrain the
individual metal-sheathed thermocouples. Alignment of
the pins during remote maintenance operations is
accomplished by means of a guide incorporated in the
handling tool. The housings shown in Figs. 6.7.18 and
6.7.19 are aluminum. In those applications where the
disconnects were located above and/or in close proxim-
ity to heated INOR-8 pipes and vessels, the disconnect
housings were fabricated from stainless steel in a similar
manner. Disconnects of this type are shown in Fig.
6.7.6.

Outside the reactor and drain cell, thermocouples are
individually disconnected with single-circuit Bakelite-
insulated disconnects (Thermo Electric type PMSS and
JMSS or equal, conforming to the requirements of
ORNL Specification 1S-160). Similar single-circuit dis-
connects are used inside the reactor and drain cells.
These disconnects are Thermo Electric type PMESS and
JMESS, insulated with Electrobestos material.

6.7.8 Containment Penetration Seals

6.7.8.1 General. To prevent the escape of gaseous or
particulate activity from the reactor system during
normal operation or in the event of an accident, all
 

 

 

 

thermocouple penetrations of containment were re-
quired to be sealed. Since none of the MSRE thermo-
couples penetrates or forms a part of the reactor
primary containment barrier, all such penetrations in

325

the MSRE are penetrations of reactor secondary con-

tainment or of the building containment air system..

The permissible leakage through these penetrations
varies widely accordmg to the type of containment
penetrated

6.7.8.2 Coolant and fuel storage cells Areas such as
the fuel storage cell and the coolant cell are maintained
at a slight negative pressure by the butldmg contain-

ment air system, and considerable leakage through the

penetration can be tolerated. In these areas, thermo-
couple lead wire was routed directly through conduit or
other openings in the containment wall, and the flow of
air through the penetration was reduced to an accept-

able level by using small openings and by caulking

where required.
6.7.8.3 Fuel and drain tank cells. In the fuel and
drain tank cells the requirements for leak-tightness of

containment penetrations are more stringent "The total’

allowable outleakage from these cells is 8.2 l:ters/hr

STP at a cell pressure “of 40 psig.* This leak rate

corresponds to 1% of the cell volume per day at the -

conditions postulated for the maximum credible acci-
dent. Although this leak rate is appreciable in itself, it is

the total of all leakages through walls and penetrations,

‘and since there are numerous penetrations, the average
leak rate through individual penetrations must be much
smaller. No maximum leak rate was specified for
individual thermocouple penetrations; however, it was
desirable that the total leakage through these penetra-
tions be kept to a small fraction of the total leakage.
Accordingly a maximum leak rate per wire penetration
of 107 std cc of nitrogen per secondt at 50 psi
differential was set as a design objective, and an effort
was made to maintain this objective during fabrication
-and installation of components of. the thermocouple
penetration seal system. This objective was not always
reached; however, it was often exceeded, and the net
result was an acceptable averall leakage rate. All
thermocouple wiring penetrating the  fuel and drain
tank cell containment, except that associated with
safety systems, is routed into multiconductor lead-wire
- cables which are sheathed with Y,-in.OD copper tubing.

 

“*R. C. Robertson, MSRE Design and Operations Report, Part
I, Descr_’iption of Reactor Design, ORNL-TM-728, p. 441.: -~

$10™* cc/sec corresponds to approximately 1 bubble/min in
water immersion tests.

Seals are provided around the copper tubing at the
point of containment penetration and at each end of
the cable. Inside the cell the seals are radiation-resistant
glass-to-metal seals. Outside the cell the ends are sealed
with epoxy. Either of these seals would be adequate in
itself to satisfy ‘containment requirements; however,
both are réquired to prevent moisture absorption in the
cable. To further ensure containment and to provide a
means of leak detection, provisions are made for
continuous pressurization of the cables at 50 psig. To
eliminate dependence on the pressurization system the
in-cell glass-to-metal seals were designed to withstand
S0 psi ‘'differential pressure in either direction without
degradation of leakage characteristics.

Figure 6.7.20 shows the construction of the in-cell
seal, and Fig. 6.7.35 shows a completed assembly. This
seal was shop fabricated and uses a 13-pin glass-to-metal
header seal and a standard tubing reducer. The tubing
reducer was flared at the large end so as to fit closely
inside the lip of the header and soft soldered to the
cable sheath. Prior to this operation the cable was cut
slightly - longer. than the required length, the outer
sheath and braid of the cable were stripped from one
end for a distance of approximately 4% in.; and the
insulation of* the individual wires was stnpped for a
distance of 4 in.

The bared ends of the individual wires were then
threaded in tubes in the header at preassigned locations,
and the header was slipped over the wires and soft
soldered to the flared reducer. Following this, the
individual wires were soldered to the header tubes.
Special solders and fluxes and .considerable skill and
practice were required to obtain satisfactory bonds to
the Chromel and Alumel wires.

The completed cable and end seal assembly was then
mounted to the disconnect and the wires connected to
the plug board in the manner previously shown in Fig.
6.7.19 and discussed in paragraph 6.7.7. After complet-

-ing assembly of the disconnect and cable, the seal and

cable sheathed were tested for leaks. N

Following the above shop operauons,'the disconnect
was mounted in the cell, and the attached cable. was
routed to and through the containment penetrations.
Containment penetration seals were made by soldering
the penetration sleeve to the cable sheath msuie and
outside the cell. :

"The cables were then routed to a preamgned locatlon
on:a pressurized header and cut ‘'to a length which
would leave sufficient wire for connection to the

N

- junction box terminal strips. At this point the outer

sheath and braid of the cable and the insulation on
individual wires were stripped as required, the insulated
 

 

 

 

 

ends of the exposed wire were dipped in epoxy, the
cable was inserted through the pressurizer header, and
the cable sheath and wire seals were made in the
manner shown in Fig. 6.7.21A4. Since these operations
were performed in the field and since repair of defective
epoxy seals was either difficult or impossible, only
qualified personnel were allowed to make the reactor
seals. The qualification procedures included instructions
on the methods and fabrication of satisfactory seals in
the shop. Figure 6.7.22 shows a header assembly with
completed epoxy seals. The header shown is a test
section. Actual headers in the reactor are larger and
mount as many as seven cables and associated seal pots.

After the epoxy seals were completed and tested, the
individual thermocouple wires were connected to termi-
nals in the junction boxes.

All headers are connected to a common 50-psig
nitrogen pressure source. Valving and gages were pro-
vided in this system as required to permit individual
headers to be continuously pressurized, pressurized and
valved off, or vented. The headers are normally kept
under continuous pressurization with the vent valve
closed. When both the supply and vent valves are
closed, the rate of pressure drop in the header is an
indication of the leakage rate in the cables and end
seals. Because of outgassing of cable insulation, a
pressure buildup in the cables and header could occur if
leakage were very small. Since such pressure buildup
must be relieved by venting and since the vented gas
would be slightly radioactive, the vent lines are routed
to air ducts discharging into the containment air stack.

The sheathed mineral-insulated cables used for safety
system lead wire in the reactor cell are sealed with
swage-type compression seals attached to the ends of
the containment penetration sleeve with threaded pipe
fittings.

6.7.8.4 Other systems. In other systems, such as the
off-gas sampler, sealing requirements were intermediate
to those of the building containment and the fuel and
drain tank cells. Seals in these areas were designed to be
consistent with the individual system containment
requirements. , ,

Mineral-insulated, sheathed thermocouple penetra-
tions of charcoal bed containment are sealed with
swage-type compression seals (see Fig. 6.7.10).

Off-gas sampler thermocouple penetrations are sealed
by potting the lead wires in a copper tube sleeve with
epoxy and inserting them through swage-type compres-
sion fittings screwed into the containment box wall and
sealed with soft solder (see Fig. 6.7.21B).

326

6.7.9 Routing

Inside the reactor and drain cell the design of the
thermocouple system was strongly influenced by re-
mote maintenance requirements. Considerable effort
was required to locate disconnects, assign thermo-
couples to particular disconnects, and route thermo-
couple and lead wire so that individual components
could be removed with their thermocouples attached
and so that the thermocouples, disconnects, and lead
wire associated with one component would not prevent
or restrict the removal of another component or
interfere with other remote maintenance operations. In
addition, it was desirable that the thermocouple discon-
nects be located as near the top of the cell as possible,
with no obstructions directly above the disconnect, so
that disconnect operations could be performed by
pulling or pushing from above with simple, straight
tools. Also, since the maximum length of the available
sheathed thermocouple material was 30 ft, it was
desirable that the disconnects be located as close as
possible to related components so that the use of
individual disconnects or in-cell splices could be mini-
mized. In almost all cases it was possible to accomplish
these objectives with a single disconnect. However, in a
few cases it was necessary to use jumper cables between
removable disconnects mounted on the components
and fixed disconnects mounted at some distance from
the component. No in-cell splices were necessary.

Outside the reactor and drain cell, most thermo-
couples are terminated in single-circuit disconnects.
Radiator thermocouples, however, are connected di-
rectly to terminals in a junction box and are not
provided with disconnects. Most control-grade lead wire
is routed from disconnects to junction boxes through
conduit and wiring ducts and thence to the main patch
panel through wiring trays. However, some lead wire is
routed directly to readout instrumentation or to smaller
patch panels located in auxiliary areas. Lead wire
connecting from the main patch panel to readout
instrumentation is routed in wiring trays. Lead wire
associated with the safety system is routed in conduits
directly to the readout instrumentation. Multiple con-
duits are provided so that redundant channels are kept
separate from each other and from the control system.

The junction boxes are sheet metal enclosures in
which barrier-type terminal strips are mounted. A
junction box of the type used outside the reactor cell is
shown in Fig. 6.7.23. :

6.7.10 Thermocouple Patch Panels

Figure 6.7.24 shows the construction of the main
patch panel cabinet. This cabinet consists of a standard
ORNL modular frame equipped with double doors,
front and rear integral lighting, and internal braces on
which are mounted the thermocouple and pyrometer
panel. The pyrometer panel is 47 in. wide and 2_8'/2 in.
high overall and is fabricated in four sections. Each
section contains 180 duplex (Chromel and Alumel)
jacks, giving a total of 720 jacks on the full panel. The
jacks are Thermo Electric Company type 3JBSS as-
semblies, inserted from the rear through drilled holes
and ‘supported at the rear so as to be flush with the face
of the panel. The panelboard material is %-in. black
Bakelite. Identification numbers are engraved on the
board below each jack.

" The thermocouple ‘panel is similar in construction to
the pyrometer panel but is 35% in. high and contains
960 jacks.

Figure 6.7.25 shows the rear of the panel before
completion of wiring connections. Lead wire from the
thermocouple is connected to the upper (thermo-
couple) panel, and lead wire from the readout instru-
mentation is connected to the lower (pyrometer) panel.
Connections between the panels are made with flexible
patch cords. The cords are constructed of flexible
extension lead cable (Thermo Electric Company type
PPFT or equal with Instrument Society of America
calibration KX) and have plugs attached at each end.
The plugs are Thermo Electric type 2PSS assemblies
similar to the male section of disconnects used in the
field. Connect and disconnect operations are performed
with a straight line motion without the need for turmng
or tw1stmg

It was originally intended that all patch cords be of
equal lengths sufficient to reach any thermocouple jack
from any pyrometer jack. This objective was found to
‘be - impractical, because the resultant large mass of
extension cable obscured the operator’s view -of the
‘board and ‘prevented closing the front doors. To correct
this situation the patch cords were cabled  in semi-
_permanent bundles, and mdmdual leads were shortened
to eliminate excess cable. Long patch cords are kept on
hand for use in temporary revisions in therm0couple
assignment.

The patch panels used in the f'ueI processing and
charcoal bed systems are similar in construction but are
smaller in size, and the patch cords are permanently
connected to the thermocouple lead wire at terminal
strips located .behind the panel instead of being plugged
into a thermocouple board. ‘

6.7.11 Materials '

6.7.11.1 General. Wherever possible, standard mate-
rials and commercially available assemblies were used in

‘the MSRE thermocouple system; however, special

materials were required in some areas. In' general,
standard materials and assemblies were adequate for
monitoring auxiliary systems outside of the reactor and
drain cell, and special materials were required on'the
heated salt systems and on those portions of the
thermocouple system that were located inside the

~reactor and drain cell.

All of the special and most of the standard materials
were procured in accordance with formal ORNL specifi-
cations. Vendor certification of conformance to the
specifications was required, and selected samples of
materials were tested at ORNL before acceptance.

6.7.11.2 Standard thermocouple assemblies. The fol-
lowing types of standard thermocouple assemblies are
used in the MSRE:

Type A. Preassembled stainless-steel-sheathed, magne-
sium oxide-insulated Chromel-P—Alumel thermocouple
assemblies, purchased in strict accordance with ORNL
Specification IS-124* and stocked in ORNL stores.

Type B. Preassembled well-type spring-loaded minia-
ture bayonet assemblies consisting of a fiber-glass-
insulated Chromel-P—Alumel wire pair, sheathed in a
3/,6~in‘. stainless steel protection tube with the hot
junction grounded in a coin-silver tip. This assembly is a
commercially available type (Thermo Electric Company
type 2C2131D or equal) and is equipped with 12-in.-
long metallic armored leads and a male connector.

In general, types A and B are used where the required
length was less than 3 ft and temperatures are less than
1000°F. The use of type B couples was further limited
to conventional applications such as measurement of
cooling water temperatures in nonradioactive areas. -

Most of the type A and all of the type B couples are

installed in wells. Type A couples installed in wells were

equipped with spring-loaded bayonet retainers.

- Figure 6.7.26 shows the construction of the type A
thermocouple ‘assemblies. Specification IS-124 requires
that assemblies be fabricated in accordance with this
drawing from materials specified in company specifica-
tions 1S-121° and 1S-160° and lists procedures for
fabrication and inspection of the assembly. Specifica-
tion 1S-160 -covers the requirements.for thermocouple
connectors, and specification IS-121 covers the require-
ments for magnesium oxide-insulated, stainless-steel-
sheathed Chromel-P—Alumel ' thermocouple material.

329

Most of the type A assemblies are fabricated of
materials having a %-in. sheath outside diameter and
No. 22 AWG wires; however, in some applications,
materials having a Y} ¢-in. sheath outside diameter and
No. 30 AWG wires were used.

6.7.11.3 Special thermocouple assemblies. The fol-
lowing types of thermocouple assemblies were specially
fabricated at ORNL for use on the MSRE:

Type C. Inconel-sheathed, magnesium oxide-insulated

Chromel-P—Alumel assemblies fabricated from bulk
length materials purchased in strict accordance with
ORNL Specification IS-502."
. Type D. Stainless-steel-sheathed, magnesium oxide-
insulated Chromel-P—Alumel assemblies fabricated
from bulk-length store-stock materials purchased in
strict accordance with ORNL Specifications IS-121°
and IS-160.°

In ‘general, type C assemblies are used on all in-
stallations where the thermocouples are attached to
heated pipes and vessels containing molten salt, and
type D assemblies are used on auxiliary systems where
the temperatures are less than 1000°F and the thermo-
couple length is greater than 3 ft.

Most of the type D assemblies are fabricated of
materials ‘having .a Y-in. sheath outside diameter and
No. 22 AWG wires; however, in some applications,
materials having a ' ¢-in. sheath outside diameter and
No. 30 AWG wires were used.

All type C thermocouple assemblies except those
associated with safety systems have a %-in. sheath
diameter and contain two wires (Chromel-P and
Alumel). To provide a means of detecting detached
couples, the safety system thermocouples were fabri-
cated from individually sheathed single-wire material,
having a sheath diameter of % in.; that is, the
individual Chromel and Alumel wires are contained in
separate ¥, -in.-OD sheaths.

3.4.5 Bend Test

331

Upon receipt of the material, the Company may perform the

following bend test on any portion of any length of thermo-
couple material supplied. Failure of any length to pass this test
will be cause for rejection of the entire shipment.

A portion of any length will be tightly wound around a
mandrel that has a diameter twice that of the sheath outside
diameter. The outside surface of the assembly will be liquid
penetrant inspected in accordance with paragraph 3.4.4. Also,
the insulation resistance at room temperature will be tested for
compliance with paragraph 3.2.2. Any change in the insulation
resistance greater than 5 percent will be cause for rejection.

Section 3.1.2 specifies a premium-grade wire instead
of the standard grade specified in IS-121.

Section 3.3 specifies an Inconel sheath.

Section 3.4.2 modifies the swaging requirements and
provides for single-conductor material as well as two-
conductor.

Section 3.4.5 is an additional requirement.

6.7.11.4 Standard lead wire. With a few exceptions,
all lead wire in areas external to the reactor and drain
cell is unshielded commercial, standard polyvinyl-
insulated wire purchased in accordance with the follow-
ing requirements:

Wire, thermocouple extension, 2-conductor ‘with
polyvinyl-polyvinyl insulation. Thermocouple wires
shall be T/C grade Chromel-P and Alumel, bright
anneal, manufactured by Hoskins Manufacturing Co.,
Detroit, Michigan. Seller shall certify the T/C wires
supplied are as specified and shall provide certified
reproductions of Hoskins tags taken from wire coils
that furnished the T/C wire. Each wire shall have a
smooth, bright finish, shall be free from cracks and
slivers, and shall be fully annealed. The emf vs.
temperature characteristics of the Chromel-P vs Alumel
thermocouple pair shall conform to the standard emf vs
temperature cuive as established by the National
Bureau of Standards (Table 17, NBS Circular 561)
within’ 4°F (£ 0.089 mV) over the temperature range
from 32 to 400°F. Each conductor shall be #16 AWG,
solid wire with polyvinyl insulation not less than 0.020
in. thick, color coded for Chromel-Alumel as per I.S.A.

wet insulation resistance test. A sample not less than 12
in. long selected at random shall be bent at the center
on a %-in.-diam mandrel to. form a U-shaped loop with
straight sides. The loop shall be immersed in 2 in. of tap
water with 180 V DC impressed between conductors
(Chromel to Alumel) in series with a current measuring
meter. The wet insulation test shall be acceptable when
the current measuring meter shows less than 50 mA of
current flow after immersion of sample loop for 10 min
at 25°C.

In areas where considerations of ambient temperature
and radiation precluded the use of polyvinyl insulation
and where extraneous electrical noise pickup was not a
problem, unshielded, glass-fiber-insulated lead wire is
used. This wire consists of two No. 20 AWG (Chromel-P

‘and Alumel) wires, insulated individually and overall

with glass-fiber braid, and is thermocouple-grade mate-
rial having a standard calibration accuracy identical to
that listed in Tables I and II of IS-121. This material
was purchased through ORNL stores in strict accord-
ance with ORNL Specification 1S-122.2

In applications, such as the radiator differential-
temperature measurements, where the effects of extra-
neous thermal emf’s and electrical noise could not be
tolerated, shielded, glass-fiber-insulated thermocouple-
grade lead wire was used. This wire is similar to the
unshielded glass-fiber-insulated wire described above
but is shielded with an overall metallic braid shield. An
outer jacket of insulation prevents grounding of the
metallic braid shield.
" The mineral-insulated lead wire used to connect
safety system thermocouples inside the reactor cell to
external junction box terminals is thermocouple-grade
material of the type described in paragraph 6.7.11.2.

6.7.11.5 Special lead wire. Connections between dis-
connects associated with control-grade thermocouples
in the fuel and drain cells and external junction box
terminals are made with multiconductor thermocouple
lead-wire cables purchased in strict accordance with
ORNL Specification JS-81-177.%. These cables consist

" of six pairs of Chromel-P and Alumel wires and one

Standards; positive conductor yellow, negative con- -

ductor red; overall yellow polyvinyl insulation not less

than 0.020 in. thick; maximum overall cross section
dimension of fabricated wire shall not exceed 0.230 in.
Wire shall -be shipped on spools with acontinuous
‘length of wire from 4500 to 5000 ft per spool. The
total resistance per 100 ft at 68°F shall not exceed 24
-§2. The finished extension wire shall pass the following

copper ground wire, glass-fiber insulated, and enclosed
in a Y, -in.-OD copper tube sheath. _

The Chromel-P and Alumel wires in the cable are
premium-grade materials that are equal, within the

‘temperature limits of 32°F and 530°F, to correspond-

ing materials in the magnesium oxide-insulated,

" sheathed thermocouples to which they connect (see

paragraph 6.7.11.2). All wires, including the ground

wire, are No. 22 AWG solid wire. ~ '
Individual wires are covered with a double wrap or

braid of glass fiber, one wrap in each direction. The
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrap is impregnated with a moisture- and heat-resistant
compound (No. 24 cable varnish, Schenectady Varnish
Company, or approved equal), colored clear. Chromel-
P—Alumel pairs are identified with colored traces in an
overall white wrap, and the single copper conductor is
colored black.

The conductors are cabled wnth the copper wire and a
matched Chromel-Alumel pair in the core and with five
matched Chromel-Alumel pairs laid parallel to each
other around the core. The cabled conductors are
contained in a 0.010-in-wall fiber-glass-braid jacket.
The jacket is impregnated with a moisture- and heat-
resistant ‘compound (No. 1 glass sticker, Schenectady
Varnish Company, or equal) and is colored brown. The

332

maximum outside diameter of the cabled conductors is

0.200 in.

This multiconductor cable assembly is enclosed in an
outer sheath consisting of a type OF soft-annealed
seamless copper tube having an outside diameter of
0.250 * 0.002 in. and a wall thickness of 0.023 + 0.002
in. The cable was pulled into the tubing. Application of
the tubing by swaging, drawing, or rolling was not
allowed.

The finished thermocouple cable assembly was re-
quired to have a minimum length of 100 ft and to have
no visually detectable gas leaks along the full length of
its sheath when pressurized with 100 psig clean, dry,
oil-free air and immersed in water for 15 min.

Prior to insertion in the copper tube sheath, the
insulated cable was required to pass a wet insulation
test in which 180 V was applied between conductors of
a sample of cable at least 18 in. long, bent in the center
around a 1% -in.-diam mandrel to form a U-shaped loop
with straight sides, and immersed in tap water to a
minimum depth of 4 in. Current flows in excess of 50
pA after 10 min immersion at 25°C were cause for
rejection.

6.7.11.6 Mnscellaneous materials. Single-thermocou-
ple disconnects used in the reactor coolant system
and in similar -applications are Thermo Electric type
PMSS and JMSS, procured in accordance with IS-160.

Junction box terminal strips are barrier-type ORNL
store stock items (Cinch Jones or equivalent). Standard
commercial boxes obtained from ORNL stores were
used for junction box enclosures where possible. Special
boxes were fabricated where standard sizes were not
suitable.

6.7.li .DeveIOpmental Tests

Concurrent with the design and installation of the
MSRE thermocouple system, tests were performed to

evaluate materials and techniques and to demonstrate
the performance of those selected. Results of these tests
are summarized below. Additional details are reported
in the Molten-Salt Reactor Program Semlannual Prog-
ress Report.! 023

6.7.12.1 Drift tests. Six Inconel-sheathed, magnesium
oxide-insulated Chromel-Alumel thermocouples se-
lected from material purchased for evaluation were
furpace tested in an air environment at temperatures
between 1200 and 1250°F for 18 months. The temper-
ature equivalents of the emf outputs were determined
at intervals and compared with that of a calibrated
platinum vs platinum—10% rhodium test couple. The
calibration of all six thermocouples was within the
allowable %% limits at the start of the test, and none
drifted more than +2°F during the test period.

Eight Inconel-sheathed, magnesium oxide-insulated

‘Chromel-Alume! thermocouples randomly selected

from MSRE stock were subsequently tested under
similar conditions for a period of approximately two
years. Results of these tests are shown in Fig. 6.7.27.
Not shown in Fig. 6.7.27 are the random drifts of +1.5
to +2.5°F that were observed during the initial nine-day
calibration period when the furnace temperature was
cycled between 1000 and 1400°F. This initial drift and
the subsequent drift during the first 150 days are
thought to be due partially to inadequate annealing
after fabrication and partially to changes in thermoelec-
tric properties of the portion of the Chromel-Alumel
wire material which operated in the temperature region
between 700 and 1000°F.

6.7.12.2 Thermocouple attachments. Surface. A vari-
ety of types of surface attachments were fabricated and
tested in the instrument development laboratory. In-
cluded in these tests were the following types of
attachments:

1. sheath brazed directly to INOR-8 surface,

2. sheath brazed to INOR-8 button, button spot-
welded to INOR-8 surface,

3. sheath brazed to INOR-8 tab, tab brazed to INOR-8
surface,

4. sheath brazed to INOR-8 tab, tab welded to INOR-8
surface,

5. sheath welded to INOR-8 tab, tab welded to INOR-8
surface.

All braze joints were made with 82% gold—18% nickel
alloy. A variety of tab configurations were investigated,
including end tabs and both single- and double-wing
side tabs. Consnderatlons in the evaluation of candidate
attachments were:
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1. compatibility with reactor meiallurgical require-
ments, ' ’

2. ease of fabrication in shops and field,

3. ruggedhess — that is, resistance to forces generated
by pulling, prying, bending, and thermal cycling,

4. accuracy of temperature measurement.

The type which most nearly satisfied all requirements
was the side-tab all-welded type described in paragraph
7.6.2. ‘ .

Spot-welded types were rejected for reasons of
ruggedness. All types involving brazing to the INOR-8
surface were rejected because of metallurgical require-
ments and difficulty of field fabrication. After proper
techniques were developed, welding of tabs to the
sheath was found to be easier than brazing.

Radiator. The test rig shown in Fig. 6.7.28 was
assembled for use in developmental testing of mechani-
cal attachments for use on the MSRE radiator tubes. A
succession of attachments were tested, of which the last
was the one used at the MSRE and described in Sect.
6.7.6.3. During the test, the rig was heated to tempera-
tures and subjected to air flows approximating those to
be encountered in the MSRE. Results of tests of the
selected attachment are presented in Table 6.7.1. In
runs 1, 2, 3, and 4, the test couples were insulated with
Fiberfrax board. In run 5, the thermocouple was
covered with a heat-conducting cement (Thermon X63)
and insulated with three layers of %-in.-thick Fiberfrax
paper. Considerable improvements in accuracy were
obtained with this combination; however, it was later
determined that Thermon was not acceptable for use in

Table 6.7.1. Results of tests of radiator

the MSRE because of its corrosive effect on INOR-8.
(Metallurgical examination of a typical attachment
coated with Thermon and- heated to 1250°F for a
period of five weeks revealed corrosion to a depth of 1
mil on the surface of the INOR-8 tube in contact with
the Thermon cement). Subsequent tests on test sections
without Thermon showed little difference in errors
obtained with Fiberfrax paper and Fiberfrax board
insulation. Since the paper form required no machining
or preforming prior to installation, it was selected as the
preferred type.

6.7.12.3 End seals. Several sealing and potting mate-
rials were tested for use in sealing the ends of
mineral-insulated thermocouples and copper-tube-
sheathed thermocouple extension cables terminating in
disconnects located inside the reactor and drain tank

cells and in junction boxes located near penetrations

outside the cells. Organic materials were tested for use
outside the cells, and inorganic materials were tested for
use inside the cells. Materials tested included: Ames
Technical-G copper oxide cement, Sauereisen No. 30
ceramic-base cement, Thermostix ceramic-base cement,
Ceramacite C-100 ceramic-vitreous enamel compound,
Physical Science Company 0900 glaze compound,
Araldite epoxy compound, Rayclad Tubes polyvinyl
chloride shrinkable tubing, and glass-to-metal seals
supplied by the Hermetic Seal Corporation.

No acceptable seals were obtained with the Ames,
Sauereisen, and Thermostix materials; either the gas
leak rate was too high or the electrical resistivity was
too low. , '

Good seals were obtained with Ceramacite C-100, a
ceramic-vitreous enamel material produced by Consoli-
dated Electrodynamics Corporation. In one test, min-
eral-insulated copper wires, sheathed in a stainless steel
tube, were satisfactorily sealed with this material when
the copper was protected by a helium atmosphere
during curing. Although the curing temperature of the

.C-100 compound is 1200°F, seals were obtained that

were leak-tight to helium and- moisture after being

~subjected to 60 psig water pressure. These seals also

withstood a 500-V insulation breakdown test after
moisture was dried from the outer surface.

Excellent end seals for metal-sheathed, mineral-
insulated thermocouples were obtained with Physical
Science Corporation formula 0900 glaze compound.
This material is a water-mix compound that adheres to
metal and is completely nonhygroscopic when cured at
1550°F for a period of 15 min. Test seals were helium

. leak-tight with 50 psig applied pressure. Because the

0900 material is brittle when cured, seals made with
this material must be handled carefully during installa-

 
e

 

 

e

 

tion and mechanically protected against subsequent
damage.

A number of epoxy and glass-to-metal end seals, of
the type described in paragraph 7.8.3 for multiconduc-
tor extension cable, were fabricated and tested. After
proper techniques were developed, seals were obtained
which were helium leak-tight with 60 psig applied
pressure. Epoxy seals were made with both bare and
fiber-glass-insulated wire. It was found that leakage
along the wires in insulated wire seals could be
prevented by doping the fiber-glass insulation with
Duco cement before potting. |

A shrinkable tube made by Rayclad Tubes was tested
for use in sealing the ends of mineral-insulated thermo-
couples located outside the reactor and drain tank cell.
Test seals made with this material were helium leak-
tight at 100 psig.

6.7.12.4 Engineering test loop installations. Eight
MSRE prototype surface-mounted thermocouples were
installed in the ETL facility to determine, under
simulated operating conditions, the reliability of attach-
ments and the accuracy of wall temperature measure-
ments taken with thermocouples located on the walls of
pipes and components adjacent to heaters. Sheathed
Y 6-in.-OD single-conductor, two-wire and %-in.-OD
sheathed duplex thermocouples were mounted in pairs
adjacent to 30-gage bare-wire reference thermocouples
at three locations. A similar pair of thermocouples was
located adjacent to a reference thermocouple installed
in a well at a fourth location. A typical installation is
shown in Fig. 6.7.29. Differences in readings between
the test thermocouples and their respective reference
thermocouples were noted periodically over a three-
year period. Limits of the variation in the temperature
differences during the first 1500 hr of operation are
listed in Table 6.7.2. These limits were not exceeded
during the remainder of the three-year test period. The
loop temperatures at the point of thermocouple attach-
ment were normally between the limits of 1040°F and
1200°F during the test period; however, a number of
cycles from 1200°F to ambient temperature to 1200°F
were accumulated as the result of loop shutdowns. All
thermocouples were still functioning satisfactorily at
the end of the test period.

6.7.12.5 Pump test loop installations. Tests were
conducted with MSRE prototype surface-mounted ther-
mocouples installed on the pump test loop for the
purpose of determining how accurately thermocouples
located on the walls of pipes adjacent to heaters
measure the temperature of molten salt inside the pipe.
Temperature indicated by wall-mounted thermocouples
and a well thermocouple in the salt stream were

compared at various operating conditions with heaters
turned on and off. Figure 6.7.30 shows a schematic of
test installations. Figures 6.7.31 and 6.7.32 show the
deviation of indicated pipe wall temperature from the
indicated salt temperature with heaters turned on and
off. Figure 6.7.33 shows the results obtained by turning
the box heaters on and off and then adjusting the pump
cooling air flow in an attempt to keep the salt
temperature constant. Data obtained from these tests
indicate the temperature readings of the surface-
mounted thermocouples are influenced by the heaters
to the extent that the thermocouples could not be used
for computation of reactor heat power or for precise
measurement of the mean reactor temperature unless
the heater power was maintained constant and a
correction was made for the bias in the thermocouple
reading. _

A clear choice of the best type of installation or
location did not appear to exist; however, the following
general observations were made:

1. Thermocouples in the box heater section appeared
to be less affected by heater power than those in the
Calrod-heated section.

2. Thermocouples in the box-heated section which
were located near the top showed less bias in reading
than those located near the bottom but were more
affected by variations in heater power.

3. The 30-gage reference couples showed less bias and
were less affected by the heaters than other surface-
mounted couples. This type is not, however, accept-
able for long-term service in the reactor system.
 

 

 

4. The performance of the Y ¢-in. two-wire, single-
conductor couples was slightly better than the %-in.
duplex couples. However, the difference was not
sufficient to justify the additional cost and effort
required for this type of mstallatlon except in a few
special locations.

S.. The thermocouple mstalled in the well was least
af fegted by variations in heater power.

6. Comparison of the performance of thermocouple
T40 with T46 and of T66 with T69 indicates that
the addition of insulation over the couples in the
box-heated section did not sngmficantly improve
their performance.

7. The data presented in Fig. 6.7.33 indicate that the
bias in the surface-mounted couples may be a
function of pump cooling air flow.

All thermocouples used in these tests were calibrated
before installation, and the data presented were cor-
rected to compensate for the deviation of individual
thermocouples from standard temperature-emf charac-
teristics.

Observation of the performance of these thermo-
couples was continued over a three-year period, which
ended when the section of pipe on which they were
installed was removed from the loop. Logging of data
was discontinued after the second year; however, all
test thermocouples appeared to be functioning satisfac-
torily at the end of the test. Several reference couples

335

were lost during the course of the test. Except for

several extended shutdown penods operating tempera-
tures were normally near 1200°F.

6.7.12.6 Bayonet thermocouple tests. Ten MSRE
prototype wall-mounted thermocouples were installed
in the drain-tank bayonet cooler test facility to deter-

mine the effects of fast temperature transients on the

life of these thermocouples. The thermocouples tested
consisted of both ¥, 4-in.-OD sheathed single-conductor,
two-wire and %-in.-OD sheathed duplex thermocouples

with junctions grounded to walls'and end seals. These

thermocouples “were subjected to -rapid “temperature
changes between 1350°F and 200°F at 1-hr intervals.

All but three thermocouples failed during the test. One
failed at 6 cycles, one at 900 cycles, two at 1600 cycles,

one at. 2049 cycles, and two at 2630 cycles. When the
bayonet tubes were removed, it was observed that the

sheaths of several thermocouples were broken at one or -

more points along the portions of their length which
‘had been subjected to thermal shock.

6.7.12.7 ‘Freeze valve thermocouple tests. Six MSRE
prototype wall-mounted thermocouples were installed

on a freeze valve in a test conducted to determine the
durability of these units in this type of service and to
determine the accuracy of the measurement of wall
temperature at the-cooled and heated area of the valve.
Sheathed Y,-in.-OD single-conductor and 4-in.-OD
duplex thermocouples were mounted in pairs adjacent
to a 30-gage bare-wire reference thermocouple at three
locations on the valve. The locations and methods of
attachment are shown in Fig. 6.7.34. The test thermo-
couples agreed with the reference thermocouples, ex-
cept that during rapid heating and cooling, differences
of 15 to 20°F in temperature readings were noted. All
the thermocouples were still functioning after two
weeks of intermittent operation of the valve. No
significant difference in the performance or desirability
of the Y ¢-in. single-conductor and “-in. duplex
thermocouples was noted.

In subsequent freeze valve tests, an undetermined but
appreciable mimber of thermal cycles were accumulated
on these and other thermocouples. Performance was
generally satisfactory. The main purpose of the latter
tests was to determine the best locations for the
thermocouples, to develop control techniques, and to
demonstrate freeze valve operation.

6.7.12.8 Radiation damage tests. To determine the
effects ‘of radiation on typical in-cell components of the
MSRE thermocouple system, the assembly shown in
Fig. 6.7.35 was exposed to a 10°-R/hr ¢°Co gamma
source for a period of eight months. Total accumulated
radiation dosage was 5.6 X 10° R. Components of the
assembly included a copper-sheathed multiconductor
extension' lead cable, sealed at both ends with glass-to-
metal seals; a disconnect; and sections of sheathed
mineral-insulated thermocouple material sealed with
Physical Science Corporation 0900 glaze compound and

with polyvinyl chloride shrinkable tubing. Insulation

resistance was checked periodically with a 500-V
Megger, and pressure in the extension lead cable was
monitored with a gage. During the eight-month test
period the insulation resistance between a typical
thermocouple circuit and ground decreased from 5 X
105 Q to'2 X-10° £, and a continual buildup of
préssure in the sheathed cable assembly was noted,
which indicated a possible outgassing of organic filler
material in the fiber-glass insulation. Although the gas
was slightly radioactive-and the préssute buildup could
damage the cable unless relieved, it was decided that the
outgassing could be tolerated if provisions were made to
routinely vent the cables to the containment air stack.

The polyvinyl chloride shrinkable tubing began show-
ing physical damage after seven weeks of exposure. Also
tested at this time were epoxy seals of the type
 

 

 

 

described in paragraph 6.7.8.3. Figure 6.7.36 shows
epoxy seals before and after seven weeks exposure.

In subsequent tests, specimens of Mica-Temp and

Super-Temp radiation-resistant ceramic-insulated wire
were sealed in copper tubes and irradiated in the same
facility for a period of six months. Gas pressure buildup
was also observed in these assemblies until the end of
the test; however, no change in resistivity of wire
insulation was observed.

6.7.12.9 Coolant salt radiator differential tempera-
ture thermocouples. Tests were conducted on thermo-
couple and extension lead-wire materials used in the
differential temperature thermocouple installation on
the MSRE coolant salt radiator to determine how much
mismatch of materials could be tolerated without
incurring excessive error in the computed reactor heat
power signal. Since a 5% accuracy in the overall heat
power measurement was required and since a number of
factors, including the flowmeter accuracy and the
accuracy of various electronic components, as well as
the accuracy of the thermocouples, contribute to the
overall accuracy of the heat power computation, an
arbitrary maximum inaccuracy of 2% % was assigned to
the AT measurement. A 2'%4% error in temperature
measurement corresponds to an error in the emf
produced by the thermocouple circuits equivalent to
2°F. Laboratory test results showed that, under certain
conditions of mismatch between thermocouple and
extension lead-wire materials, error voltages equivalent
to as much as 2°F can be generated in a single junction
when the temperature of the junction is varied over the
range from 32 to 150°F. Since several junctions are
involved, the need for careful design and matching of
material was apparent, and the design of the MSRE
installation was revised to obtain the maximum possible
cancellation of junction effects. Additional error volt-
ages can be produced by variations in ambient tempera-
ture if the thermocouple lead-wire material is not
perfectly homogeneous. Tests performed at the MSRE
showed that such effects were present in the MSRE
thermocouple lead-wire installation and that excessive
noise was present on the signal. The existing lead wire
was replaced with a continuous run of higher-quality
shielded lead wire. Tests performed after the shielded
lead wire was installed indicated that the long-term drift
previously observed had been eliminated but that
excessive intermittent noise was still present. The
thermocouple lead wire was then insulated to eliminate
ground loops. Further tests showed that the noise had
been eliminated.

the type described in-paragraph 6.7.7 operated satisfac-
torily when tested in a remote maintenance facility.

6.7.13 MSRE Performance

6.7.13.1 Mechanical reliability. During the period
between the start of operational checkout in late 1964
and April 1968, the reactor was at temperatures above
900°F for 20,000 hr and accumulated 11,500 hr of
nuclear operation. During this period there were only
12 failures out of the 1142 thermocouples installed.
Five of these failures occurred as a result of physical
damage during construction and operation. Sixty-nine
of the 1142 total thermocouples are installed in the fuel
processing system and had seen little service as of April
1968. Of the remaining 1073 thermocouples, 866
normally operated at temperatures above 1000°F.

A breakdown on the various types of failures is
tabulated below:

Damaged during maintenance . . ..............c.c00.... 2
Opencircuit ............. e et e e 3

Abnormally low reading (detached) ....... Vet reernanans 2

This excellent reliability is believed to be the result of
attention to detail during the design, procurement,
fabrication, and installation of all parts of the thermo-
couple system and, in particular, is the result of the
design of the weld attachments, end seals, and discon-
nects and of the quality control measures taken during
the procurement and fabrication of the thermocouples.
The conscientious efforts of the construction and
maintenance crews in avoiding damage or disturbance
to previously installed thermocouples also contributed
to the reliability. o '

6.7.13.2 Accuracy. Approximately 330 thermo-
couples are used to measure the temperature at various
locations on the fuel and coolant circulating salt
systems. Only two thermocouple wells are provided,
one each in the coolant radiator inlet and outlet pipes.
The remaining thermocouples are attached to the pipe
or vessel walls. The thermocouples on the radiator tubes
are insulated to protect them from the effects of the
high-velocity air that flows over them during power
operation; the others are not insulated and thus are
subject to error because of exposure to heater shine and
to thermal convection flow of the cell atmosphere

within the heater insulation. In March 1965, with the

fuel and coolant systems circulating salt at isothermal
conditions, a complete set of readings was taken from
all the thermocouples that should read the temperature
of the circulating salt. A similar set of data was taken in
June 1967 at the start of run 12. The results of the two
sets of measurements are shown in Table 6.7.3.

tor thermocouples with those for the other thermo-

couples shows the effect of insulation on reducing the
scatter. Comparison of the sets of data taken over two
years apart shows very little change, certainly no greater
scatter. Figure 6.7,37 shows that the statistical distribu-
tion of the deviations of individual thermocouples from
the mean also changed little in the two years. ‘
The scatter in the various thermocouple readings is
reduced to an acceptable level by using biases to correct
each reading to the overall average measured while both
fuel and coolant systems are circulating salt at isother-
mal conditions. These biases are entered -into the
computer and are automatically applied to the thermo-
couple readings. The biases are revised at the beginning
of each run and are checked when isothermal condi-

tions exist during the run. Generally, the biased -

thermocouple readings have been reliable, but there
have been a relatively few cases when there have been
shifts in thermocouple readings that have resulted in
calculation errors. |

6.8 BU’BBLER LEVEL sysrsm‘ |
6 8 1 lntroductlon

Durmg the early stages of the MSRE design there was
no proven method of measuring levels of molten salt
which was considered suitable ‘for use in reactor
systems. Although point-contact: indication was ade-

 
 

 

 

 

quate for some MSRE level measurement (see Sect.
6.10 and 6.11), a continuous indication of fuel and
coolant pump bowl level over the measurement range
was needed. Prior to 1960, attempts had been made to
obtain continuous measurement of molten-salt level
with bubbler- and resistance-type systems.!'? Both
efforts were only partially successful. The resistance
sensors performed well initially but had excessive
drift,' and the bubblers were plagued with dip-tube
plugging.?  Another type of level sensor, which offered
~ promise for continuous measurement of molten-salt
level, was a float-type transmitter developed for use in
measuring liquid metal levels in the ANP program.?
After review of the previous experience, two systems,
the bubbler and the float type, were selected for further
development, and provisions were made in the initial
MSRE design for installation of either or both of these
systems. Some consideration was given to development
of the resistance-type sensor, but this approach was
abandoned when further attempts to determine the
reason for the excessive drift previously experienced
were unsuccessful. Some of the principles of the
resistance-type continuous-level element are, however,

338

embodied in the design of the conductivity-type single-

point level probe discussed in Sect. 6.10.

Development of both bubbler- and the float-type
systems was successfully completed, and the perform-
ance and reliability of both systems were successfully
demonstrated on a level test facility and on engineering
test loops. The bubbler-type system is presently used to
measure level in both the fuel and coolant pump
bowls.* A float-type system is also used to measure
coolant pump bowl level. The bubbler system used in
the MSRE is described below, and the float-type system
is described in Sect. 6.9. A comparison of the bubbler
and float level systems is also presented in Sect. 6.9.

6.8.2 System Description and Theory of Operation

A simplified diagram of the fuel pump bubbler system
is shown in Fig. 6.8.1. The basic operation of the
system is the same as that of conventional dip-tube
bubbler systems in that the level signal is obtained by
measuring the differential between the pressure in the
gas space above the molten salt and the pressure inside
the dip tube. When the tube is purged with a small gas
flow and the salt density is maintained constant, the
differential pressure produced is proportional to the
height of salt above the bottom of the dip tube.

The MSRE installation presented special problems not
found in a conventional installation because (1) the
bubbler system piping communicates with the primary

system and forms a possible escape path for radioactive
gases and (2) the system could fail if pressure transients
in the reactor pump bowl forced molten salt into the
cold purge piping external to the pump bowl. In the
present system design, containment of radioactive
materials is effected by placing double check valves and
block valves in each purge line and by enclosing the
valves and all lines and equipment downstream of the
check valves in a secondary containment vessel. Plug-
ging of the purge lines with salt during pressure
transients is prevented by maintaining the volume of
the purge lines downstream of the check valves as small
as is permitted by pressure drop considerations and by
installing a surge pot having a volume ten times that of
the purge lines in the heated zone adjacent to the dip
tube. The present system is designed to withstand a
60-psig pressure increase from 6 psia without plugging
the purge lines. The surge pot is a toroidal pipe inside
the pump bowl.5 _

A capillary restrictor located upstream of the check
valves serves a double purpose of providing a means of
flow measurement and of preventing back diffusion of
radioactive gas into operating areas. The purge rate is
controlled by throttling valves. Deviation of the purge
rate from the design value is detected by pressure
switches installed upstream of the capillaries. This
method of flow measurement assumes that the pump
bowl pressure is constant. Since the pump bowl
pressure is relatively constant during normal operations
and the flow is not critical, the accuracy obtained is
adequate for the purpose. Solenoid valves installed
downstream of the capillaries provide a means of
checking the zero calibration of the differential pressure
transmitter. The solenoid valves are also used to block
the lines on a signal from the safety control circuitry.
The differential pressure transmitters, weld-sealed sole-
noid valves, and restrictors used in this system are
described in Sects. 6.8,6.19, and 6.20.

Two types of dip tubes are used in the MSRE. The
dip tubes in the fuel pump are open-ended, with a small
V notch cut in the side, while the dip tubes in the
coolant pump bowl have a closed end with a !4-in. hole
through the side of the tube just above the bottom
closure. There is no appreciable difference in the
operating characteristics of the two types. Both types
were operated satisfactorily in a prototype pump test
installation, and the V notch was selected as the
preferred type. However, the coolant pump was com-
pleted before the fabricators received the revised
drawings. The consideration involved in selecting the V
notch as the preferred type was not of sufficient
importance to warrant opening the pump, and since the
 

 

 

coolant pump was also equipped with a ball-float level
transmitter of the type described in Sect. 6.9, the
preferred V-notch dip tube was not used in the coolant
pump. '

6.9 BALL-FLOAT-TYPE MOLTEN-SALT
' LEVEL TRANSMITTER

6.9.1 Introduction

" The high-temperature ball-float-type molten-salt level
transmitter transmits an electrical signal that is propor-
tional to the level of the molten salt in the coolant-salt
pump bowl of the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment.
This electrical signal is transmitted to a Foxboro
Dynalog recorder-transmitter, which, in turn, retrans-
mits a pneumatic signal proportional to the incoming

electrical signal. The pneumatic signal operates an.

indicator on the main control panel in the reactor
control room . and may be connected by means of
solenoid valves either to a molten-salt level recorder or
to high- and Jow-level alarm switches at the discretion
of the reactor operator (see Sect. 3.3).

~ As discussed in the preceding -section: (6.8), the
bali-float transmitter was developed to serve as an
alternate to the bubbler level system, and provisions
were made in the initial MSRE design for installation of
either or both types of systems. Because of physical
space limitations, it was not possible to .install a
float-type transmitter on the present fuel pump bowl;
however, a float-type transmitter has been incorporated
in the design of the Mark II replacement pump. The

Mark I pump level transmitter differs from the
transmitter described below in that the ball float is-

located in a stilling well inside the pump bowl and has a
range of 7.5 in. :

6.9.2 System Description

The float leve! indicator system, shown schematically
in Fig. 6.9.1, consists of a float-positioned INOR-8-clad
Armco iron core, a high-temperature low-impedance
radiation-resistant differential transformer, a weld-
sealed float chamber, and a modified Foxboro Dynalog
recorder with pneumatic retransmission. The float
chamber, which is separately mounted beside the pump
bowl] and attached to it by piping, contains the INOR-8
float and the INOR-8- clad iron core. The differential
transformer is mounted above the chamber, outside the
containment, and operates at or near system tempera-
ture (900 to 1300°F). This transformer detects the
position of the core and transmits a signal proportional
to level. Since the core position is detected magnet-

"jcally, no penetration of containment is required. The

Foxboro Dynalog contains an excitation system for the
differential transformer; the amplifiers and balance
system for the recorder; the null balance, phasing, and
range controls for the differential transformer; and the
pneumatic transmitter that transmits a 3 to 15- psi
signal proportional to the recorder pen position. This
instrument is mounted in the transmitter room. The
Foxboro Dynalog is connected to the differential
transformer with a four-conductor, shielded cable. The
pneumatic signal from the Foxboro Dynalog is con-
nected to the main control panel through solenoid
valves which allow the reactor operator to select this
system or the bubbler system to control the level
indicator on the main control panel (see Sect. 3.3).

6.9.3 Construction

Figure 6.9.2 shows the major components of the float

‘level system before installation of the float and core

assembly in the float chamber and with the differential
transformer removed from its enclosure.

' With the exception of the differential transformer,
the float, and the float chamber, all components of this
system are standard commercial items. Since the trans-
former is in contact with the float chamber and is very
near the pump bowl, it is directly exposed to high
temperatures, and in the Mark II pump installation, it is
exposed to high levels of nuclear radiation. The Armco
iron core is also exposed to high levels of temperature
and radiation, and both components are required to
operate dependably for two years or more in this
environment.! Although differential transformers were
commercially available which were suitable for short-
term operation at 1200°F and radiation-resistant trans-
formers had been developed at ORNL for 600°F

service,2 none of these were suitable for use on the ball
float transmitter,and it was necessary to develop the
special type needed. The transformer shown in Figs.
6.9.2 and 6.9.3 is the result of this development
program. This transformer is 10 in. long, the iron core is
5 in. long, and the range of the level indicator is 5 in.

The iron core is contained in the long tube shown :

attached to the float in Fig. 6.9.2.

The materials of which this transformer is constructed
are Lava “A”3 pure nickel wire, Fiberfrax insulation,*
and INOR-8.° All of these materials have good high-
temperature characteristics and do not deteriorate
significantly when exposed to high levels of nuclear
radiation for long periods. '

The primary and secondary of the differential trans-
former are wound in grooves machined in a Lava “A”
sleeve as shown in Figs. 6.9.3 and 6.9.4. Each consists
of a single-layer low-impedance winding of approxi-
mately 230 turns of No. 24 nickel wire. The secondary
of the transformer is wound differentially so that the
turns on one half of the transformer are wound in a
clockwise direction and the turns on the other half in a
counterclockwise direction. The primary is wound in
one direction only. After the primary and secondary are
wound, the transformer is assembled by fitting the two
winding sleeves together with a third outer sleeve as
shown in Fig. 6.9.2,

The physical relationship between the components of
the differential transformer and between the differen-
tial transformer and the molten-salt system is shown in
Fig. 6.9.5. The three layers of INOR-8 that are between
the iron core and the transformer primary and second-
ary have negligible effect on transformer operation.
This is because of the high electrical resistivity, the low
temperature coefficient of resistivity, and the nonmag-
netic characteristics of INOR-8. The three Lava “A”
transformer sleeves are shown with the Fiberfrax
insulation surrounding them. The Fiberfrax provides
mechanical isolation and prevents any direct and
possibly destructive contact between the transformer
can and the relatively fragile transformer. The wires
used to wind the primary and the secondary of the
transformer are left long enough to reach a junction
box several feet from the transformer. These wires are
insulated by ceramic beads and pass through a %-in.
OD tube from the transformer can to the junction box.
In Fig. 6.9.2, the beaded wires can be seen coiled at the
end of the transformer.

After assembly and before being sealed in the INOR-8
can, the transformer is electrically balanced by remov-
ing windings from the primary or secondary or by
moving one winding in relation to the other. The

transformer may then be fired by placing it in a furnace
and raising its temperature to approximately 1500°F.
At this temperature the Lava “A” starts to fire and, in

doing so, changes dimensions with the result shown in

Fig. 6.9.4. This change effectively locks the sleeves
together and prevents any relative movement between
them that would destroy the results of the previous
electrical adjustments.

After the transformer has been fired and tested, it is
“canned” for protection in an INOR-8 container as
shown in Fig. 6.9.5. After this it is again heated, this
time to the expected operating temperature, and tested.
If this test is successful, the transformer is ready for
use, -

‘The float and the float chamber are constructed of
INOR-8 and are designed to thhstand 75 psig pressure

at 1200°F.

6.9.4 Theory of Operation

In operation, the float-positioned iron core varies the
magnetic coupling between the primary and the second-
ary windings of the transformer as it moves from one
position to another.

The induced voltage to the two halves of the
secondary of the transformer will vary in direct relation
to the position of the iron core. When the windings of
the transformer are properly balanced, the - voltages
induced in the two halves of the secondary are 180° out
of phase. Thus, when the voltages induced in each half
of the secondary are equal, their sum is zero, and the
signal output of the transformer is zero. This will be the
case when the iron core is positioned in the transformer
at a point equally distant from the ends of the
transformer. This is commonly called the null or
centered position of the core. If the induced voltages
are not equal, as is the case when the iron core is nearer
one end of the transformer than it is the other, the
output signal is the algebraic sum of the two voltages
and is in phase with the larger of the two. As discussed
in Sect. 5.2.1.3, the Foxboro Dynalog compares the
phase of this output signal with the phase of the voltage
generated by the internal excitation oscillator to deter-
mine the direction of movement of the recorder pen.
The amplitude of the signal voltage determines the
magnitude of pen movement from the zero signal
voltage, or null, position.

‘With the exception of portions of the input circuitry,
the Foxboro Dynalog recorder is a standard instrument
and operates in the manner described in Sect. 5.2.1.3.
The Dynalog input -circuit shown in Fig. 6.9.6 is a
standard circuit which has been modified to match the

/
 

 

 

 

low impedance of the differential transformer to the
output impedance of the Dynalog excitation oscillator
and to provide means of balancing out resrdual signals
resulting from stray capacitances.

The 1000-Hz signal required to excite the differential
transformer primary is obtained from winding B on the
oscillator distribution transformer (T1). Windings C and
D provide excitation for the internal bridge and a
reference voltage for the phase-sensitive detector.

A step-down transformer (T2) is used to match the
low impedance of the differential transformer primary
to the output impedance at winding B. Exact imped-
ance matching is not obtained and is not desirable. The
turns ratio of transformer T2 was selected so that the
oscillator will not be overloaded under conditions of
maximum load. The resistance of the differential
transformer primary is 15 £ at room temperature and
increases to 40 £2 at 1250°F. The oscillator loading will,
therefore, be highest when the differential transformer
is at room temperature and will decrease as the
transformer temperature increases. Although variations
in loading affect the amplitude of the oscillator voltage,
the resultant changes in differential transformer excit-
ation and output are offset by corresponding changes in
the internal bridge excitation, and there is no net effect
of loading on the span of the instrument.

The center-tap-grounded - resistance networks con-
nected across the primary and secondary of T2 and the
Faraday shields in transformers T1 and T2 minimize the
magnitude of voltages capacitively coupled through T1
and T2 and induced in the transformer leads.

The residual balance network connected across the
secondary of T2 is used for rejection of residual
(quadrature) voltage resulting from unbalance of capaci-
tance between .the primary and secondary of the
differential transformer and from incomplete s}ueldmg
in transformers T1 and T2.

" Phase shifts between the internal bridge and differen-
tial transformer output voltages, which occur predom-
inantly in the differential transformer, are corrected by
the output phase adjustment.

The instrument span is-determined by the resistances
in the ‘internal bridge and by the setting of the span
potentiometer.

Zero adjustment is accomplrshed by unbalancnng the
internal bridge.

In the MSRE system, the recorder is adjusted so that
the pen will rest at center scale (50 division mark on a 0

341

of the iron core is a point midway between the upper
and lower limits of the measurement range, and the
recorder span is adjusted so that the recorder pen moves

" from zero to full scale as the float-positioned core

moves from a position 2.5 in. below the null position in
the transformer to a point 2.5 in. above the null
position. In this manner the full (5 in.) span capability
of the differential transformer is utilized. After this
initial adjustment, minor trimming adjustments or range
changes can be accomplished using the recorder span
and zero adjustments.

‘Changes in temperature between 1000 and 1250°F

have little effect on the sensitivity or range of the level

to 100 division chart) when the iron core is in the

center of the transformer. Under these conditions, the
signal output of the transformer is zero. The trans-
former is positioned so that the center, or null, position

loop designed for this purpose? showed no appreciable
change in these characteristics over a period of three
years. Test data indicated that an accuracy of 0.1 in.
over the temperature range from 900 to 1300°F can be
expected.®

6.9.5 Comparison of Ball-Float and Bubbler Systems

Both the bubbler and the ball-float systems are
considered to be suitable for the MSRE pump bowl
level application and for future applications in molten-
salt reactors. Each type has certain advantages and
disadvantages which must be considered before using
either type in reactor systems. The bubbler system
offers the advantage of simplicity of in-cell construction
and essentially unlimited range capability. The absence
of moving parts in the portion of the bubbler system
inside the cell eases the problem of remote mainten-
ance; however, the bubbler supply lines form a possible
escape path for radioactive materials, and obstruction
of these lines with frozen salt will result in serious
errors or in complete failure. Although the bubbler
system is basically simple, the auxiliary devices and
instrumented closures required to maintain contain-
ment and prevent salt plugging make this type of
system relatively complex and expensive. Another
disadvantage of the bubbler system is that it is sensitive
to pressure transients and will produce erroneous
information if the rate of pressure rise is excessive. (In
the MSRE system, errors will occur if thrs rate exceeds
8.5 psifsec.)

Since the ball-float system detects level magnetically
through the walls' of a nonmagneti¢ tube, piping or
electrical penetrations of the walls of the salt-containing
system are not required; the transmitter body can be
completely weld-sealed, and no- auxiliary devices or
systems are required to ensure containment. The
salt-plugging problem does not exist in the ball- float

 
 

 

 

342

~ system, and pressure effects are negligible. However, the

float-type system is inherently limited to applications
where the level measurement span is low, and since the
ball-float -transmitter contains components which are
conceivably subject to failure, provisions must be made
for remote maintenance when the transmitter is in-
stalled inside secondary containment.

Since the principles of operation and construction of

the ball-float and bubbler systems are different, the
possible modes of failure of the primary sensors in these
systems are unrelated.

This diversity of failure modes can be used to
advantage in the design of reliable systems. If the
reliabilities of the two types of systems are comparable,
a higher degree of reliability can be obtained by using
both types of systems as redundant pairs than would be
obtained by using two identical systems of either type
as redundant pairs. _

transmitter is shown on the MSRE construction

6.10 CONDUCTIVITY-TYPE SINGLE-POINT |
'MOLTEN-SALT LEVEL PROBE

6.10.1 Introduction.

The electrical-conductivity-type single-point molten-
salt level probes in the drain tanks of the Molten-Salt

Reactor Experiment are installed for the purpose of

checking the calibration of the drain tank weigh cells.
Each tank has two single-point probes with a common
excitation system. These single-point indicators are

positioned in each tank so that signals will be generated |

when the tank is filled to 10% and to 90% of its
volume. , : .

The weigh cells on each tank are used to indicate
continuously the weight of the molten salt in the tank.
This weight can be used, with corrections for tempera-
ture, to calculate the volume of molten salt in the tank.
With the tanks empty, these cells can be calibrated
directly by the use of known weights placed on the
tanks, but once the tanks are filled the recalibration of
these cells is, for all practical purposes, impossible. For
this reason it was deemed necessary to install in each
tank two fixed- point level indicators that would not be
affected by environmental changes, but would repeat
accurately the level of the molten salt in the drain
tanks, when the molten salt was at these fixed points, as
calibration check points for the weigh cells.

In similar applications, the spark plug probe' has
been used as a single-point level indicator, but this
device has several inherent characteristics that made it
undesirable for the MSRE installation. As the spark
plug probe is a high-impedance device, with an insulator
that must isolate the probe from the grounded tank
wall, any vapor-deposited material on the insulator will
tend to form a conducting path around the insulator
and render the level probe inoperative. Also, the seal
around the insulator, which must be part of the
containment vessel, would always be questionable.
These deficiencies can be tolerated in nonnuclear

applications since the probe is easily replaceable in most

cases and since small seal leakages can sometimes be
tolerated. Replacement of probes in the Molten-Salt
Reactor Experiment would, however, be very difficult,
 

 

 

 

and absolute leak-tightness must be maintained over
long periods of time. Also, the process of opening the
containment for replacement of probes would present
the possibility of radioactive contamination of the
surrounding area and of oxygen contamination of the
molten salt in the tank. To meet the requirements of
the MSRE, a single-point level ‘indicator was developed
that would not be affected by any deposited material,
could be permanently welded into the system without
the need for gasketed seals, and could be expected to
have a dependable Operatmg life equal to the useful life
of the d:am tank, = -

6.10.2 Physicﬁl Construction of Probe

The conductwlty-type single-point ‘molten-salt level
indicator used in the Molten-Salt Reactor Expenment
has three electrical circuits: an excitation circuit and
two signal-generating molten-salt level-sensing circuits.
Figure 6.10.14 is a simplified cutaway that shows the
manner in which the two single-point level-sensing
elements, using a common excitation circuit, are as-
sembled. This is the type of instrument installed in the
drain tanks. The section indicated ByR, is the common
excitation element mentioned above, and the sections
indicated by R, and R; are the 31gna1-generat1ng
elements for the high- and low-level indicators respec-
tively. The plate at the lower end of each element is the
contact that senses the presence of the molten salt.
Figores 6.10.2 and 6.10.3 are photographs of a level
indicator before assembly was completed. On the left in
both photographs is the mounting head with the
insulators for the electrical curcuits. Figure 6.10.3 is a
close-up of the head. The insulators used to bring out
the signal and excitation circuit wires and to seal the
tubes that extend into the drain tank can be plainly
seen. To the right of the head, in both photographs, is
. the excitation plate. This is shown more clearly in Fig.
6.10.3. To the right of the excitation ‘plate in Fig.
.6.10.2 is the high-level sensing plate. Note that each

sensing plate is independently susPended from the
excitation plate. The tubing that supports the low-level

~ plate does not touch the high-level plate but passes
~ through holes machined in this plate The spacer

~ maintains the separation of these tubes to prevent

contact with the high-level sensing plate.

6.10. 3 ‘Theory of Operatxon e

Figure 6.10.1B is a simplified electncal schematic that
“explains the theory of operation of the level indicator.
The excitation voltage V, is generated by a 1-kHz

343

current I, from a 150-VA fixed-frequency excitation
power supply, flowing through the resistance R, of the
excitation circuit. Because of the extremely low imped-
ance of this circuit, approximately 0.030 £, an
impedance-matching transformer is inserted between it
and the excitation power supply. Molten-salt level is
determined by measuring. the voltage ¥, between the
excitation plate EP and the high molten-salt level
sensing - plate - SP,, or the voltage V3 between the

_excitation plate and the low molten-salt level sensing

plate SP;. Both level-sensing circuits operate in an
identical manner; therefore, for the sake of simplicity,
only the operation of the low-level sensing plate, SP;,
will be explained.

When' the level of the molten salt is below the sensing
plate SP;, there is no current flow in the tube R,
connecting the sensing and excitation plates, and except
for small residual noise potentials, the voltage differ-
ence between the sensing plate and the excitation plate
is zero. When the molten salt touches the sensing plate,
a current I3 will flow from the excitation plate EP to
the sensing plate SP3, then through the molten salt to
the tank wall. The flow of current through the
resistance of the tube walls results in a voltage
difference ¥, between the excitation and the sensing
plates. Thus, a 1-kHz millivolt-level signal is produced
that indicates contact between the molten salt and the
sensing plate. The magnitude of the signal will vary with
excitation, with the length of the signal generating
section between the excitation plate. and the sensing
plate, and with the conductivity of the molten salt. The
signal - voltages: measured at the Molten-Salt Reactor
Experiment have been approximately 80 MV for the
high-level probe. and approximately 350 MV for the
low-level probe, with a background noise level less than

3 MV, It should be noted that there may be a slight

difference in the molten-salt level at which contact
between the sensing plate and the molten salt is
completed or broken. This difference is due to the
adhesion of molten salt to the sensing plate when the
level is lowered below the plate. Measurements indicate

that this difference ‘can be as great as 0.125 in. In very
~ large diameter tanks, this could be an appreciable
quantity of liquid and should be considered in any
weight or volume calculations in- whlch the single-point

level indicator is used as a reference. ,

. The millivolt signal generated by, the probe is ampli-
fied and used to Operate a relay that controls a light on
the main control board. The condition of this light
indicates whether molten salt is or is not in contact
with the sensing plate. The relay amplifier used is
frequency sensitive for 1 kHz and has a manual set

 
 

 

 

 

 

point adjustment that will allow the set point, or trip
point, to be adjusted to operate anywhere in the range
of 5 to 50 MV. The amplifier input circuit is protected
by a double Zener diode which prevents misoperation
of the amplifier at signal levels above 50 MV. Figure
6.104 is a block diagram of a complete circuit for one
level sensing plate from sensing plate to panelboard
light. Note that each sensing plate has its own matching
transformer, amplifier, relay circuit, and panel light.

6.11 ULTRASONIC MOLTEN-SALT LEVEL PROBE
6.11.1 Introduction

An ultrasonic level probe is used in the fuel storage
tank to provide a remote single-point indication of
molten-salt level in this closed, weld-sealed vessel.

The purpose and operational usage of the ultrasonic
probe are the same as those of the conductivity level
probe used in the fuel and coolant drain tanks and
described in Sect. 6.10. Although it was initially
planned to do so, the conductivity probe was not used
in the fuel storage tank because the expected corrosion
rate in the tank during fuel processing operations was so
high that the thin (0.030 in.) walls of the conductivity
probe would probably be penetrated before completion
of the fuel processing cycle. The feasibility of the
ultrasonic level probe was under investigation when the
corrosion problem was discovered and, since this type
of probe is amenable to thick-wall construction, it was
selected for the fuel storage tank application.

The ultrasonic probe system used in the MSRE was
developed for the AEC by Aeroprojects, Inc., with the
assistance of ORNL. ORNL participation in this project
consisted in reviewing the Aeroprojects design and
incorporating such revisions as were required to satisfy
the metallurgical, containment, and environmental
requirements of a reactor-grade installation; fabrication
of those parts of the probe that required special
materials and fabrication techniques; and providing
assistance to Aeroprojects, Inc., in testing the system
after installation.

6.11.2 System Description

As shown in Fig. 6.11.1, the system consists of a tank
probe assembly, an excitation rod-assembly, a trans-
mitter, and a receiver.

The tank probe assembly consists of a vertical
1,-in.-diam rod, a level sensing bar, and a proprietary
support called a force insensitive mount. The level
sensing bar is welded to the bottom of the rod and has a
rectangular cross section selected to be resonant at the

oscillator frequency. The vertical rod is suspended from

and welded to the force insensitive mount at the point
where the rod enters the tank.
The excitation rod assembly is external to the tank

and consists of a solid % -in.-diam stainless steel rod and

a force insensitive mount. The rod connects the tank
probe assembly to the transmitter and receiver, and the
force insensitive mount supports the rod where it passes
the concrete wall of the fuel processing cell.

The transmitter is a magnetostrictive transducer lo-
cated at the outer end of the excitation rod and is
excited by an electronic power oscillator. The length of
the excitation rod and the ‘dimensions of the force
insensitive mounts and the tank probe assembly are
chosen so that the system is resonant at the 25-kHz
oscillator frequency. A third force insensitive mount
(not shown in Fig. 6.11.1) supports the transmitter.

The receiver consists of two piezoelectric crystals and
a differential amplifier. The crystals are bonded to the
excitation rod near the transmitter. Output voltages
generated by the crystals are amplified by a differential
amplifier. The resultant difference signal is used to
operate a relay that controls high- and low-level
indicator lamps on the main control panel.

The force insensitive mount, a proprietary item of
Aeroprojects, Inc., is the element in this system that
differentiates it from other ultrasonic level indicators
now commercially available and that makes possible

ultrasonic detection of level in - high-temperature
~ molten-salt reactor systems. The design of this-mount
permits ultrasonic ‘energy to be transmitted through -
‘containment walls, along the excitation rod, and into

closed vessels without excessive loss and thus allows the
excitation and detection transducers to be mounted
outside the biological shield in a hospitable environ-
ment -away from corrosion, high temperature, and
nuclear radiation. The mount can be fabricated of the
alloys used in reactor work and welded into the
containment vessel wall. The resulting penetration is a
rigid all-welded assembly that neither reduces the vessel
integrity nor restricts the flow of ultrasonic energy.

6.11.3 Theory of Operation

In principle, the ultrasonic probe is an acoustical
impedance device. Level is determined by detecting the
different states of acoustical energy transmission which
exist when molten salt is in contact with the sensing bar
at the lower end of the excitation rod and when the
level is below the sensing bar. The amount of energy
trarismission is a function of the degree of mismatch
between the probe sensing plate and the surrounding
medium. The acoustical impedance of, the surrounding
medium is an inverse function of density. When the
level is below the sensing plate, the surrounding
medium is a gas, the acoustical impedance match is
poor, and the amount of energy tranmission is low.
Conversely, when the level is at or just above the
bottom of the sensing plate, the sorrounding medium is
partially molten salt, the impedance match is improved,
and the amount of energy transmission is increased.

To provide a means of detecting changes in energy
transmission and thus provide a measure of acoustical
impedance, the system is tuned to resonance at the
oscillator frequency. The magnetostrictive transducer
excites this tuned circuit by converting electrical energy
from the power oscillator into longitudinal vibrations of
the excitation rod. The energy contained in these
vibrations is transmitted to the sensing plate by the
excitation rod and is either radiated to the medium
surrounding the sensing plate or is reflected back along
the excitation rod. The reflected component produces a
standing wave along the excitation rod, the amplitude
of which is a function of the reflected energy. The ratio
of the maximum amplitude of this standing wave to the
minimum amplitude is called the standing wave ratio.
This ratio 'is measured by locating the receiver crystals
at points separated by quarter wavelengths such that
one crystal is at a point of minimum vibration, called a
node, and the other is at a point of maximum vibration
(antinode). The outputs of these crystals are applied to
the inputs of a differential amplifier which produces a
signal proportional to the standing wave ratio. This
signal is used to operate a relay which, in turn, operates
the high- and low-level indicator lamps. When the
molten-salt level is below the probe sensing plate, the
standing wave ratio is high, the relay is energized, and
the low lamp is lit. When molten salt contacts the
sensing plate, part of the energy is transmitted to the
salt, the standing wave ratio decreases abruptly, the

relay is deenergized, and the high lamp is lit. A similar

abrupt change takes place when the salt breaks contact
with the sensing plate. Due to surface tension effects,

 
 

 

 

 

346

there is a slight (% in.) difference in the levels at which
contact is made and broken.

The function of the force insensitive mounts is to
provide a means of supporting the excitation rod and of
passing through the tank walls without loss or reflection
of ultrasonic energy. This is accomplished in a manner
analogous to the quarter-wave stub used on radio-
frequency electrical transmission lines and antennas.
Briefly, the dimensions and geometry of the mount are
such that the mount is resonant at the oscillator
frequency and presents a high impedance to the flow of
ultrasonic energy through the mount.

The above discussion assumes that there is no energy
loss or reflection in the probe system except at the
sensing plate. In actual practice, reflections and losses
do occur at other points. The additional losses present
no problem when kept to a minimum by proper design,
installation, and adjustment, however, the additional
reflections result in multiple resonances, which can be
troublesome if their existence is not recognized. Also,
since the resonant frequency of the system is a function
of the dimensions of the probe and the length of the
excitation rod, the performance of the probe system is
affected by ambient and storage tank temperature.
These effects are discussed further in the discussion of
performance which follows (see 6.11.5).

6.11.4 Construction

Figure 6.11.2 shows the probe assembly that is
inserted into the fuel storage tank. The force insensitive
mount, near the left end, is welded to the tank with the
curved section outside. Figure 6.11.3 is a close-up of
this curved section and the force insensitive mount. The
threaded hole in the flat end of the rod, in the lower
right-hand corner of the photograph, is for connecting
this excitation rod to the next section during preinstal-
lation testing. When installed in the MSRE, all of these
excitation rod sections were welded together.

The electronic chassis for this system are mounted in
a Bud-type cabinet on the east side of the switch house
at the MSRE. The transducer is also mounted in this
cabinet, with the excitation rod extending in a long
curve through stacked concrete radiation shielding
blocks to the wall of the fuel processing cell. The
excitation rod is supported in this wall by a force
insensitive mount, which also seals the opening through
which the excitation rod passes. Inside the cell, the
excitation rod is supported by the force insensitive
mount through which the excitation rod enters the fuel
storage tank. From the transducer to the tank, all
component parts are made of stainless steel. The force

insensitive mount on the tank and all parts inside the
tank are made of INOR-8.

6.11.5 Performance

Performance of the probe was satisfactory during
initial operation of the fuel processing system; however,
some difficulties were experienced during subsequent
operations. The probe operated very well when the tank
was filled but did not operate when the tank was
drained. A check of the instrument made at this time
revealed that the oscillator frequency had drifted 40 cps
from the original setting. Correction of the frequency
restored the instrument to an operative condition.
Further checks revealed that the frequency varied as
much as 300 Hz over a period of a few days. Since the
probe is basically a sharply tuned (high-Q) resonant
system, small shifts in oscillator frequency from the
resonant point caused the probe to become inoperative.

The problem of frequency drift was further compli-
cated by the presence of a number of resonant peaks
within the range of oscillator frequency adjustment
(some of which were not responsive to level changes)
and by the difficulty of checking instrument perform-
ance in the field without interfering with operations
(salt level must be varied to check probe performance).

The difficulties experienced with the MSRE probe
showed that some improvements were needed if the
device was to be useful for long-term operation under
field conditions. To gain a better understanding of the
problems involved, studies were made of the frequency
response and performance characteristics of the probe
system. Because of the need to minimize interference
with MSRE operations, these studies were made using
the prototype probe system installed in the MSRP level
test facility. Results of frequency response tests per-
formed in the prototype probe' are shown in Fig.
6.11.4. The response characteristics of the MSRE
probe system have not been measured but are known to
be similar. From Fig. 6.11.4, it can be seen that a
number of resonance peaks existed on the prototype
probe system. While several of the peaks were level
sensitive, the only peak that disappeared completely
when molten salt touched the plate was the one at
51,230 Hz. Note that this is not the peak with the
highest amplitude. Other peaks exhibited considerable
change in amplitude as the level rose and covered more
of the excitation rod, but the point where this occurred
was less well defined, and in some cases the change was
not sufficient to actuate the relay. Some peaks were not
appreciably affected by level, thus indicating that the
reflection points were outside the vessel. Figure 6.11.4

 
 

 

 

also shows that the resonant peaks are very narrow and
that a 100-cycle drift in oscillator frequency is suffi-
cient to render the system inoperative.

The response characteristics shown in Fig. 6.11.4
were obtained under conditions of constant ambient
and vessel temperature. Other tests of the prototype
system® showed that the resonant frequencies de-
creased at a rate of approximately 0.12 Hz/deg F as the
. sensing plate temperature was increased from 1000 to
1500°F and decreased at a rate of 6.25 Hz/deg F as the
ambient temperature increased from 68 to 84°F. In
both cases the shift was essentially linear with tempera-
ture. These results indicated that the effects of ambient
and vessel temperature would not present a serious
problem if the oscillator frequency was stable and if the
operating temperatures were reasonably constant but
that the system must be adjusted at operating tempera-
ture and readjusted if significant temperature changes
occur. These tests have not been repeated at the MSRE;
however, the vessel temperature effects should be close
to those observed on the prototype and, since the
excitation rod is longer, the ambient temperature
effects should be slightly greater.

Since performance of the prototype tests, modifica-
tions have been made in the electronic chassis to
stabilize the oscillator and otherwise improve system
performance.? Since no salt has been transferred to the
system since these modifications were made their
effectiveness has not been tested. _

Further improvements in the performance of the
uitrasonic probe system can probably be made by
installing energy-absorbing slugs in the excitation rod
and notch filters in the amplifier. The energy absorbers
would broaden the bandwidth of the resonant peaks,
and the filter would discriminate against the unwanted
peaks. A possibility also exists that an oscillator could
be designed which would automatically adjust to the
natural frequency of the system. The feasibility of

" making these improvements should -be investigated

before final selectlon of the ultrasonic probe for use in
future reactor systems. : :

6.12 NaK-FILLED DIFFERENTIAL
PRESSURE TRANSMITTER

6.12.1 Introduction

A nozzle-type venturi tube (discussed in Sects. 3.3 and
6.13) measures the flow rate of molten salt in the main
circulating loop of the MSRE coolant-salt system and
produces a differential pressure signal that is propor-
tional to the square of the flow rate. Since the venturi
must operate at system temperatures (900 to 1300°F)
and since the coolant salt freezes below 850°F, either
the device used to measure the differential pressure
must be operated at system temperature, or the system
pressures must be transmitted to a device operated at a
lower temperature. In the latter case, the pressure
transmitting medium must not be significantly affected
by the temperature transition between the system and
the device. In addition to withstanding the effects of
temperature, the device must also satisfy the coolant-
salt system containment requirement and have an
accuracy within that required for the heat power
computation (flow X AT). Also, since the coolant-salt
flow signal initiates safety actions, the device must be

| reliable.

During the conceptual stages of MSRE design, no
differential pressure device was available that could be
operated entirely at system temperature and satisfy the
above requirements, and the feasibility of developmg
such a device did not appear to be promising.*

Several methods of indirect measurement of the
differential pressure at the coolant-salt venturi taps
were considered. Of these the one that most nearly
satisfied the MSRE requirements- was the NaK-filled
differential pressure transmitter described below. The

in turn, was based on a prototype differential trans-
mitter developed by Taylor for the ANP project at
ORNL.! ORNL participation in this project was limited
to the design and fabrication of the high-temperature
seal assemblies and consisted in establishing criteria and
assisting with the conceptual design; reviewing Taylor’s
design and incorporating such revisions as were required
to satisfy the metallurgical, containment, and environ-
mental conditions of a reactor-grade installation; pro-
viding certified INOR-8 materials for fabrication of seal
parts; and performing welds and weld inspection where
special techniques were required.

6.12.2 System Description

Figure 6.12.1 shows the construction of the MSRE
NaK-filled differential pressure transmitter assembly.

‘The assembly consists of two seal assemblies and a

differential pressure transmitter. Each seal assembly
consists of a high-temperature seal, a low-temperature
seal, and an interconnecting capillary tube. Each seal
element contains a flexible, convoluted diaphragm
which is welded at the periphery to the body of the seal
element. The capillaries are also welded at the point of
attachment to the seals, and the enclosed volume within
the capillary and seals is filled with NaK. The low-
temperature seal assemblies are attached to the high-
and low-pressure ports of the differential pressure
transmitter, and the internal volumes of the transmitter
and low-temperature seals are filled with silicone oil.
The silicone oil is separated from the NaK by the
diaphragm in the low-temperature seal assembly, and
the diaphragm in the high-temperature seal further
contains the NaK and separates it from the process
fluid.

6.12.3 Theory of Operation

Since all of the internal volume within the seal
elements, capillary, and transmitter are filled with
incompressable fluids (NaK and silicone oil) and since
the diaphragms are flexible, process pressures applied to
the diaphragms in the high-temperature seals are trans-
mitted hydraulically to the differential pressure sensing
diaphragm in the transmitter with little loss. Such loss
as does exist is due to deflection of the diaphragms. The
resultant differential pressure across the transmitter
diaphragms produces a proportional force which is
applied to a force beam. The force beam acts as a lever
which is sealed and pivoted at the point of exit from

the transmitter body. A calibrated spring at the end of
the beam produces a restraining force such that the
amount of motion is proportional to the force applied.
This motion is coupled to a flexure-pivoted cantilever
beam and transduced to a force on a second flexure-
pivoted cantilever beam. A strain gage transducer
restrains the motion of this beam and produces an
electrical signal output proportional to the force. A
dash pot at the end of the force beam damps motion
and inhibits oscillation. Zero correction is accomplished
by adjusting the tension on a third spring, which applies
a constant force to the intermediate cantilever beam.
The range of the instrument is determined by the
position of the range adjuster on the force beam. The
position of this adjustment determines the lever ratios
of both the force beam and the intermediate cantilever
beam and thus determines the amount of motion of the
intermediate beam produced by a given differential
pressure.

The NaK fill fluid is a eutectic mixture of 78%
potassium and 22% sodium, which freezes at 12°F and
has a vapor pressure less than atmospheric below
1440°F. It has a low temperature coefficient of
volumetric expansion, does not corrode stainless steel
or INOR-8, and is chemically stable under conditions of
high temperature and high-level nuclear radiation. These
and other properties?’* make NaK a suitable medium
for transmission of pressures from high- to low-
temperature zones. The high-temperature seal elements
of the MSRE transmitter can be operated at tempera-
tures up to 1800°F while the main body assembly is
operated under normal ambient conditions if system
pressures and temperatures are maintained within the
limits shown in Figs. 6.12.2 and 6.12.3. Operation under
conditions where the vapor pressure exceeds the system
pressure will damage and possibly rupture the- dia-
phragm in the high-temperature seal element. This will
occur if the temperature is too high or system pressure
too low. For this reason, a high vacuum should not be
pulled on the system if the seal temperature is above
850°F.

Expansion and contraction of the NaK with changes
in ambient and system temperature and displacement of
the NaK resulting from changes in applied differential
pressure cause deflections of the seal diaphragms. These
deflections result in the presence of small differential
pressures across the diaphragm, which effectively sub-
tract from the applied. pressures and produce errors in
the transmitted signal. For this reason, the diaphragms
are required to be thin and to be constructed so as to
deflect with very little applied force. -

6.12.4 Construction:

Figure 6.12.4 shows the NaK-filled transmitter as-
sembly before installation in the MSRE. The silicone-
filled transmitter body and the low-temperature seals
are visible at the center of the photo, and one
high-temperature seal is visible at the right. The
capillaries connecting the low- and high-temperature
seals are 25 ft long. These capillaries are protected by a
flexible spiral-wrap armor tube and are not visible in the
photo.

Figure 6.12.5 shows the dlaphragm in the high-
temperature seal. The diaphragm consists of three
nested 5-mil (0.005 in.) diaphragms, which are con-
voluted to provide flexibility. The use of multiple
diaphragms was necessary because of MSRE require-
ments that the diaphragm thickness be at least 0.015 in.
and ‘because excessive stresses would be present in the
diaphragm under conditions of the maximum expected
deflection if a single diaphragm of this thickness were
used. To eliminate the entrapment of air between the
diaphragms, the diaphragm assembly was welded to the
body of the seal head in a vacuum using electron beam
technique. Elimination of entrapped air was necessary
to prevent deflection of the diaphragms when the

heated air expanded and the consequent possibilities of -

temperature-induced errors in the transmitted signal
and/or diaphragm failure. To prevent damage to the
diaphragms resulting from the application of excessive

differential pressure to the process connections, the seal -
body plate behind the diaphragm was contoured to

match the diaphragm convolution, and the distance
between the diaphragm and the plate was held to a
minimum. This contoured backup plate also serves to
minimize the volume of NaK in the high-temperature
seal. Minimizing the NaK inventory in the seal (and in
other parts of the transmitter) is desirable since release
of NaK into molten salt will result in the precipitation
of constituents of the salt proportional to the amount
of NaK released. Uncertainty as to the consequences of
precipitation was the main reason that NaK-filled
transmitters were not .used more extensively in the

MSRE. In particular, NaK-filled transmitters were not
used on the fuelsalt system because of  possible

. precipitation of uranium. All materials in the high-
temperature seal elements, including the diaphragms,
-are INOR-8. The capillary and low-temperature seal

materlafs are stainless steel. Materials in the differential

pressure transmitter are the manufacturer’s standards,
~To prevent escape of NaK and to prevent inleakage of

air, the NaK-filled assemblies are completely seal
welded. All welds were done by the inert gas tungsten

arc process (Heliarc), and full penetration was required
on all welds in contact with the molten salt.

To minimize the effects of expansion and contraction
of NaK and silicone oil with changes in temperature,
the transmitter and seal assemblies are designed so that
the volumes of the high- and low-pressure sides are
equal. Since the extraneous forces produced by volu-
metric changes in the high- and low-pressure sides are in
opposition, the net effect is zero when volumes are
equal and temperature changes are identical.

MSRE shifted calibration erratically shortly after the

 
 

 

 

start of nonnuclear operations. The cause of these shifts
was not definitely determined, but subsequent tests
indicated that they were due to leakage of air into the
silicone-oil-filled section of the transmitter. The defec-
tive transmitter was replaced with a third (spare) unit.
Performance of both of the installed transmitters has
since been satisfactory.$

6.13 COOLANT-SALT FLOW ELEMENT
6.13.1 Introduction

The coolant-salt flow element, FE-201A, is a nozzle-
type venturi tube for measuring the flow rate of molten
salt through the MSRE coolant-salt system. It is located
in a horizontal section of 5-in.-diam pipe immediately
upstream of the coolant radiator (see Sect. 3.3).
Designed and machined by B-I-F Industries, Inc., in
accordance with Company specification No.
JS-81-165', the venturi produces a differential pressure
that varies as the square of the flow rate. The
differential pressure is detected and transmitted to a
remote recording instrument by the NaK-filled differ-
ential pressure fransmitter described in Sect. 6.12 of
this report. The venturi meter was selected for this
application because it is accurate, the permanent head
loss is negligible, and all-welded construction is easily
attained. The method of fabrication is the unique
feature of this element, It is machined from a solid rod
of INOR-8.

350

6.13.2 Principles of Operation

The venturi tube is one form of head-type element for
metering the flow of fluid in a closed pipe. It forms a
section of the pipeline, and the flow of fluid through a
suitable restriction in the tube establishes a pressure
drop which can be measured and related to the flow
rate. The venturi, as shown in Fig. 6.13.1, has a short
straight throat section preceded by a short convergent
inlet section and followed by a longer divergent outlet
section. Transitions are by easy curves. The throat
section forms a restriction in the line which causes a
local and temporary increase in fluid velocity and a
corresponding decrease in pressure. The relationship of
this change in pressure to the velocity of* the flowing
fluid is the basis for measuring flow rates w1th
head-type meters.

The basic equation for calculating the weight rate of
discharge of liquid from a venturi tube in a closed pipe?
can be written as follows: .

The value of each of these variables except C; is
determined by the dimensions of the venturi and the
physical characteristics of the fluid. The coefficient of
discharge, Cy accounts for the deviation of the actual
flow from that given by the theoretical equation for
frictionless flow. The numerical value of this coefficient
must be determined experimentally by flow calibrating

* possible identical to those under which it will be used.
The coefficient of discharge is relatively constant for
large changes in flow rate so long as the fluid remains in
a turbulent state. The turbulence or dynamic state of
the flowing fluid can be determmed by computmg the
Reynolds number

where u is the absolute viscosity of fluid at flowing
temperature in centipoises. The Reynolds number is the:
ratio of the inertial forces to the viscous forces existing
in a system. This ratio establishes the conditions under

used in another, providing the systems are similar, At
Reynolds numbers above 10,000, the fluid is definitely.
in the turbulent state. The curve in Fig. 6.13.2 shows
values for Cj, plotted as a function of Reynolds
number. : S

6.13. 3 Constructlon

The venturi tube is a solid rod of INOR-S that has
been accurately machined to the dimensions shown in
Fig. 6.13.3. The design is a B-I-F Industries, Inc., model
NZIW venturi nozzle which is shorter than the
Herschel? standard venturi design but has the advan-
tages of being less difficult to machine and of fitting
more easily into pipelines. The major differences are the
shorter and more rounded inlet and exit sections of the
venturi nozzle.

The ends of the tube are beveled for butt-weldmg in a
5-in-diam, sched 40 pipeline. There are two
% ¢+in.-diam pressure taps located at the throat and two
at the inlet. The taps are made as large as possible and
‘are. located on the bottom half of the honzontally
mounted tube to ensure complete filling of the pressure
sensing lines and to avoid the possibility- of their
- becoming plugged by sediment which might collect on
~ the bottom of the venturi. The pressure sensing lines are

very short runs of %-in. sched 40 pipe. The principal
dimenstions and weld-joint construction of the venturi
assembly are shown on drawing E-GG- B-415 103 '

6 13. 4 Performance Charactenstncs o

The performance characteristics of the coolant-salt-

flow element, FE-201A, are described by the curves in
Figs. 6.13.2 and 6.13.4. The venturi flow tube assembly
was calibrated at the B-I-F Industries hydraulic labora-
tory using water at ambient temperature. The data

351

obtained were then -used to determine the coefficient of
discharge, C;, which is plotted in Fig. 6.13.2. The
calibration setup, which included sections of the up-
stream and downstream piping, is shown on B--F
Industries, Inc., drawing C-153683.* The differential
pressures produced when molten salt flows through the
venturi tube were calculated by substituting the ex-
perimentally determined value of C; in the flow
equations. The results for a salt temperature of 1100°F
are shown in Fig. 6.13.4. Curves for other salt tempera-
tures may be calculated by using the correct value for
fluid density in the flow equations. The density and
viscosity of the molten salt at any temperature between
the limits of 950 and 1250°F may be determined as
follows:

¥, = 135.27 — (1.386 X 10™2)¢ , @
logyo 1= —1-7-]?9-- 1.188, (5)
where

= density, 1b/ft>, at temperature ¢,
t = molten-salt temperature, °F,
K = viscosity, centipoises,_
= temp of molten salt, °K.

‘The venturi will produce a differential pressure that
corresponds to the actual flow rate within +%,%, but
the accuracy of the calibration curve calculated for the
flow of molten salt depends upon the accuracy of the
molten-salt physical data: density and viscosity. Overall
accuracy, that is, the accuracy of the measuring system,
consisting of the venturi tube, differential transmitter,
and recording device, is within +2% of actual rate of
flow, _

The permanent pressure loss is less than 12% of the

differential pressure.

6.14 THERMOCOUPLE SCANNER

6.14.1 Introduction

A thermocouple scanning system is used to monitor
and display the signals produced by approximately 400
thermocouples* attached to pipes and vessels in the
MSRE heated salt systems. These thermocouples are
attached to the reactor fuel and coolant system pipes,
the fuel and coolant system pumps, the drain tanks, the
reactor vessel, and the radiator. The information ob-
tained from this system is used, during reactor systems
startup and shutdown, to inform the operator of the
existence of temperature differences between moni-
tored thermocouple points which could result in ex-
cessive thermal stresses in associated pipes and com-
ponents. During normal operation, the system is used to
detect abnormalities in temperature profiles. In par-
ticular, the radiator thermocouples are monitored to
detect a drop in temperature of any of the 120 radiator
tubes below the level where freezing of salt in the tubes
could occur.

The operator observes on a 17-in. oscilloscope the
different signals produced by bucking a reference signal
against each of the scanned thermocouple signals. The
reference signal is produced by a thermocouple at-
tached to a pipe or component having 2 slow thermal
response or by a precision variable-voltage calibrated
power supply in the case of the two radiator scanners.
If no temperature difference exists between the refer-
ence signal and the output of the switch, essentially a
straight line is seen on the oscilloscope. If, however, a
temperature difference exists between all or any one of
the scanned thermocouples and the reference signal, the
oscilloscope display is deflected by an amount propor-
tional to this difference at a point corresponding to the
position of the thermocouple in the scanning sequence.
The resultant display is a temperature difference pro-
file.

An alarm detector unit is used to produce an alarm
signal when this temperature difference exceeds an
adjustable value, +50 to +300°F. When the alarm
sounds, the operator observes the scope and adjusts the
appropriate heater to reduce the thermal gradient or
takes other corrective action. The absolute temperature
of the displayed signals is determined by the precise
measurement, using a recorder or indicator, of the
signal produced by a second thermocouple located
adjacent to the reference thermocouple. A block
diagram of a 100-point system is shown in Figs. 6.14.1
and 6.14.2, S

 

6.14.2 System Description

An Advanced Technology Laboratories’ model 210
100-point mercury jet switch,t called a Deltaswitch, is
used to commutate the thermocouple input signals. As
shown in Fig. 6.14.3, the mercury jet switch consists of
a centrifugal pump which scoops mercury from a well
in the switch housing and jets it in a thin stream across
pins (switch contacts) located in a circle around the
switch. The mercury pool serves as the common output
of the switch. For thermocouples, two switch decks are
required, one for each thermocouple lead. The switch is
driven by a 1200-rpm synchronous motor, producing a
thermocouple scanning rate of 2000 points per second.
One hundred thermocouples, from a portion of the
reactor system such as the coolant system, are attached
to the switch. The commutated output signals from the

-switch are fed to a signal bucking network. Here, the

integrated output of the switch is bucked against the
reference signal. To eliminate ground loops caused by
comparing signals directly from two grounded thermo-
couples, a capacitor switching system is used. Two
double-pole, double-throw choppers operating syn-
chronously are used to sample simultaneously each lead
of the reference signal. This is accomplished by storing
the charge from each line in a capacitor and then
switching the chopper to place this charge across an
integrating capacitor in the output leads from the
commutator. Independent switching of each signal lead
eliminates the switching spikes which would occur if
the output of the reference couple were transferred into
one commutator output lead by one capacitor.

The difference signal thus produced is fed to a
Dynamics Instrument Company model 6256 differ-
ential dc amplifier. The output of the amplifier is fed to
an alarm discriminator for detecting signals which
exceed a preset value. The alarm set point can be
adjusted from %50 to +300°F by varying the amplifier
gain and adjusting a potentiometer in the discriminator.

The output from the amplifier is fed also to two
17-in. oscilloscopes, ITT model KS-707, for display. A
grid overlay and calibrated marker signal are used so
that each pulse can be identified with a given thermo-
couple. A calibrated marker signal produces a bright dot
at the position of the desired signal. The marker
generator is composed of standard components manu-
factured by Tektronix, Inc. A waveform generator type

 

*See Section 6.7. )
TFormerly manufactured by Advanced Technology Labora-
tories, Mountain View, Calif. Manufacture now discontinued.
 

 

 

162 is used to generate a ramp voltage. The start of the
ramp voltage is triggered by a sync pulse and is repeated
once during each revolution of the switch. A Tektronix
~ type 161 pulse generator is connected to the waveform
generator. A ten-turn potentiometer, calibrated in terms
of the 100 signal points, was added to the pulse
‘generator. Adjusting this potentiometer provides a
means of setting a window or voltage trigger level
corresponding to the signal identification point desired
(from No. 1 to 100). The ramp signal then triggers the
pulse generator, which produces a voltage pulse at the
correct oscilloscope sweep time. This pulse is fed to the
Z axis of the oscilloscope, producing a bright dot on the
display. The position of the dot corresponds to the
signal number dialed by the potentiometer, thus pro-
viding a means of signal point identification. To power
the two generators, a Tektronix type 160 power supply
is used. All these components are mounted in a separate
cabinet along with one 17-in. oscilloscope. This cabinet
is located close to the reactor heater control panels and
the other scanner panels.

The sync pulse for .the scope is generated by a
variable-reluctance magnetic pickup mounted close to
the drive shaft. of the switch, upon which a ferro-
magnetic pin is attached. A voltage pulse is generated in
the pickup with each revolution of the switch as the pin
on the shaft passes the pickup.

A block diagram of the alarm discriminator circuit is
shown in Fig. 6.14.4 and the circuit schematic in Fig.
6.14.5. This circuit is designed to produce an alarm
when pulse signals having an amplitude of 1 V or
greater and a repetition rate of 20 pulses per second are
applied to the input, With proper adjustment of the
differential dc amplifier, the discriminator may be
adjusted to produce an alarm with signals as small as
+50°F. A pulse integrating circuit prevents spurious
alarms from random noise pulses. Since the mercury jet

‘switch samples each point 20 times per second, input

pulses resulting from a true alarm condition will have a

repetition rate of at least 20 pulses per second, and an
alarm will occur. The discriminator alarm circuitry is
completely transistorized and is packaged in a
3Y,-in.-wide, 7%-in.-high panel-mounted housing. Also
packaged in the housing is the reference thermocouple
isolation system, a sync-pulse amplifier for driving the
oscilloscope trigger, and the necessary power -supply
circuits. See Fig. 6.14.7 for the panel layout.

. The complete thermocouple scanning system for the
reactor consists of five separate units as previously

described, except for the oscilloscopes. One unit,

scanner ‘A, monitors the reactor cell thermocouple,
scanner B the coolant system, and scanner C the fuel

353

and coolant flush and drain tanks. The remaining two
scanner (D and E) monitor the radiator tubes. (See ref.
3 for a list of thermocouples on each system.) Only two
oscilloscopes are used, one in the control room and one
in the reactor system heater control area. A switch is
used to switch the signals from any scanner to either of
the two scopes. The alarm detectors continue to
function without oscilloscope display. The entire
scanner system is mounted in standard panels located
adjacent to the heater control panels at the 840-ft
level# of the reactor building. The layouts of these
panels are shown in Figs. 6.14.6 and 6.14.7. As seenin
Figure 6.14.6, all the input signal switches and associ-
ated signal connectors are mounted on the panel. A
nitrogen purge is used to prevent oxidation of the
mercury. The rotameters on the panel are used for
indicating and controlling the nitrogen purge to each
deck of the switches. The pressure gage is used to
indicate the nitrogen purge pressure. Scanner alarms
due to an off-limit input signal or low nitrogen pressure
actuate the annunciators at the top of the cabinet. In
addition, an annunciator in the main control room,
labeled scanner common alarm, is actuated if any of the
annunciators on the scanner panel is in alarm condition.
To clear this common annunciator, the local annunci-
ator must be cleared first.

The -layout of the input signal amplifiers and the
alarm discriminators can be seen in Fig. 6.14.7. The
scanner selector oscilloscope display switch and the
reference voltage power: supply are also located on this

‘panel. The two recorders are for recording various

process temperatures, including the temperatures of the
thermocouple adjacent to the scanner reference thermo-

‘couples.

The oscilloscope and the master signal system are
mounted in a semiportable cabinet located near the
other scanner panels. To provide records of the various
system temperatures as displayed on the oscilloscope, a
Polaroid camera is mounted on the oscilloscope, and
periodically, or upon demand,’ photographs are taken of
the desired display.

- The second oscilloscope is mounted in'a panel in the
main control room panelboard together with a scanner

selector switch. This scope is used by the operators for

general surveillance of reactor system temperatures,

The thermocouple signals for all five scanners are
transmitted by Chromel-Alumel thermocouple lead wire
to terminal blocks located in scanner panel 1 (see Fig.

 

tSee drawings D-HH-B41658 through 51666 for panel
details.

 
 

 

354

6.14.8). The terminal blocks are special swing-link
blocks which allow adjacent signals to be connected
together by the swing link. This type of terminal block
was chosen in order to provide an easy method of
eliminating the display of an open thermocouple signal
by connecting it to a good signal, thus eliminating
recurring or continuous alarms.

As can be seen in Figs. 6.14.8 and 6.14.9, the
thermocouple signals are routed from the terminal
-blocks to the switch by No. 22 insulated copper wire.
Each switch has four 50-point connectors, two for each
deck. However, the thermocouple signals are not routed
directly from the terminal blocks to these connectors
but through four 25-point connectors, then through
four jumper cables which connect to the four input
switch connectors. Three additional 25-point con-
nectors are also provided for each of the switches
‘associated with scanner channels A, B, and C.
There are then seven connectors (excluding the
four primary switch connectors) associated with
all switches except those used for radiator mon-
itpfing. The extra connectors provide extra
scanner operating flexibility by allowing a group of 25
inputs from anywhere on the reactor, or 25 points
jumpered together, to be connected to any scanner.
This is particularly useful when signals on one scanner
are from parts of the reactor system which are shut
down and at a low temperature, while the remainder of
the system is at normal temperatures. By using these
extra connectors, a maximum of three groups of 25
inputs each can be jumpered to one signal at the normal
temperature, thus preventing a continuous alarm con-
dition due to low temperatures on these points.

6.15 SINGLE-POINT TEMPERATURE SWITCHES
6.15.1 Introduction

Single-point temperature switches are used to monitor
the temperatures of freeze flanges, freeze valves, and
other MSRE components and to initiate alarms or
corrective control actions when the temperatures are
above (or below) a preselected value. Signal inputs to
the switches are millivolt-level dc voltages obtained
from thermocouples.

The switches used for this application consist of a
number of individual single-channel and dual-channel
units constructed in a modular form for integration into
a system. The system is composed of the individual
switch units (called alarm modules and control mod-
ules), a common switch module enclosure, and a
separately enclosed chassis which contains a common
power supply and the master (or common) alarm
circuitry. The integrated group of switches and the
associated power supply and alarm circuits are called an
operations monitor system.* Figure 6.15.1 shows one
operations monitor system with the alarm switches
mounted in their common enclosure.

The operations monitor system uses magnetic ampli-
fiers and solid-state components only and is designed
for fail-safe operation. The basic design of the alarm
switch includes no tubes, and there are no moving parts
other than the mercury relays used to interface the
system with control and annunciator circuits. The
relays are energized when signals are within preset limits
and drop out when limits are exceeded. This action,
along with the operation of alarm lights, provides a
method of detecting and indicating operational failures
or loss of supply power. |

 

*The operation monitor system was manufactured by Electra
Systems Corporation of Fullerton, Calif., but is no longer
available as a standard item.
 

 

 

6.15.2 System Description

Two types of switches are used in the MSRE

temperature monitoring system. One type is the model

ET-4200 alarm module, shown in Fig. 6.15.3. The other
type is the model ET-4300 control module, shown in
Fig. 6.15.4. The two types are similar insofar as the
method of detection of off-limit signals is concerned
but differ in construction and in the method used to
produce alarm and control action. The major difference
in the two module types is that the control module
operates in a manner similar to an on-off controller and
will reset automatically, while the alarm module is
maintained in a latching state until the off-limit
condition is corrected and the module is manually reset.
As long as the offlimit condition exists, the alarm
module will revert to the alarm state after reset. Also,
the alarm mode has two separate and independent

switch channels mounted on a common modular card,

while ‘the control module contains only one switch
channel. Both types use magnetic amplifiers for signal
detection, and the input circuitry for all switch chan-
nels is essentially identical. |

Each alarm and control module contains set-point
control potentiometers to establish the desired alarm
limit for the signal being monitored. The set-point
control on each module is adjusted with the sensor
connected to the system. The operating range is-then
simulated by an external calibrator and the desired limit
set. Individual modules plug in to connectors at the rear
of the module enclosure and may be adjusted or
removed without affecting the operation of other
modules within the system.

Each module also contains indicating llghts for alarm
warning. The lights glow dimly when the system is
operating properly and the monitored voltage levels are
within preset limits. If the voltage input from a

monitored circuit varies outside the preset limits, the

corresponding alarm  indicating light glows at full
brilliance, and external control or alarm warning devices

are activated. Meicury-wetted relays are used to provide

contact actions for annunciator and control circuits.
Both module types can be used for either high or low
alarm action, that is, for relay dropout and alarm lamp
~ indication on increasing or decreasing signals.
Power to operate the switch modules is provided by a
common power supply which is located in the power
supply chassis. Both types of modules require regulated

low-voltage dc and 1-kHz square-wave power to operate

the magnetic amplifiers. D¢ voltage is also required for
operatlon of transistor cucults in both modules.

355

The model ET-4104 power supply chassis, shown in
Fig. 6.15.2, also contains master alarm circuits which
monitor the state of the alarm modules and provides
local and remote indication of the existence of an alarm
condition in any of the alarm modules supplied by the
power supply chassis.t (The control modules do not
activate the master alarm.) Local indication is obtained
from indicator lamps on the power supply chassis. The
remote indication is provided by an annunciator in the
main control room. An external relay was used in the
MSRE to convert the dc voltage provided by the master

alarm circuit to the contact action required by the

annunciator. Local indication in the form of an audible
signal is also available as an option but was not used on
the MSRE.

The MSRE monitoring system requires a total of 34
alarm modules and 77 control modules. These in turn
require ten power supplies and module enclosures.
There are, then, ten completed operations monitor
systems used. The systems are mounted in standard
modular panels and require two panels for the entire
system. The panels are located in the auxiliary control
room and are designated panels 5 and 6. The thermo-
couple leads are brought into terminal strips mounted
on the back of the module enclosure. The terminals for
the alarm and control relays are also mounted on the
back of the enclosure. The master alarm relay is
mounted external to the power supply. Typical panel
layouts and wiring diagrams are shown in Figs. 6.15.5
and 6.15.6.

6.15.3 Theory of Operation

6.15.3.1 General. Block diagrams of the alarm mod-
ule, control module, and power supply chassis are

~shown in Figs. 6.15.7,6.15.8,and 6.15.9.

The following discussion will be limited to a discus-

sion of the functional operation of the switch modules.

Detail of circuits and of the theory of operation can be
found in the instruction manuals listed as tterns 4 and 5
in the reference tabulation.

6.15.3.2 Alarm module. The basic eiement in the

‘control module is a balanced bistable magnetic ampli-

fier. The magnetic amplifier is composed of two
nickel-iron cores, several control, output, and auxiliary

'wmdmgs, and associated mput and output circuitry (see

Fig. 6.15.10).

 

TThe model ET4101 power supply chassis shown in Fig.
4.15.1 does not have the master alarm feature.

“Operation of the magnetic amplifier is similar to that

of a conventional amplifier having differential input and -
output and biased so that a small voltage exists at each

output when the amplifier is balanced and the differ-
ence in inputs is zero. The use of positive feedback

greatly increases the effective gain of the amplifier and

gives it bistable characteristics.

The alarm lamp is connected to one output of the
‘magnetic amplifier, and the relay is connected to the
other. Due to the mode of operation, the relay will be
energized when the lamp is deenergized and vice versa.

The differential input characteristic of the magnetic
amplifiers is obtained by the use of two windings. One
of these windings is called the input winding. The other
is called the limit-set winding. Current through the
input winding is proportional to the signal input
voltage. Current through the limit-set winding is set
manually by adjustment of a potentiometer. In series
with the input signal is a buffer choke which isolates
the input winding from the transducer and eliminates
any possibility of the transducer loadmg the magnetic
amplifier.

The input winding and the limit-set winding are
wound to oppose each other in polarity. When the
ampere-turns products of the two windings are equal a
null condition exists. In normal operation, nonalarm
state, the ampere-turns product of the limit-set winding
slightly exceeds that of the input winding, and a just
off-null condition exists. Under this condition a small
differential voltage exists at the output, the relay is
energized, and the alarm lamp glows dimly. If the
thermocouple signal exceeds the alarm limit set point,

the magnetic amplifier output passes through hull. A -

positive feedback circuit senses this and causes the
amplifier to latch in the alarmed state by effectively
increasing the input signal. In this condition, the carrier
or output power winding operation is reversed, and full
power is delivered to the alarm light and minimum
power to the control relay. The relay drops out, and the
alarm light burns brightly. This alarmed state will
continue until the input signal drops below the alarm
set point and the amplifier is manually reset by an
alarm reset button located on the front of the power
supply. '

The basic theory of operation may be simplified by
considering the operation of a single-core magnetic
amplifier. Referring to the circuits shown in Fig.
6.15.11 and the curves of Fig. 6.15.12, the basic
operation of one of the two cores in the magnetic
amplifier is as follows:

Square-wave carrier excitation (E,) is applied to the
carrier winding. On the positive half cycle, diode CR is

356

forward-biased, and E_, except for the small voltage
drop across R; caused by magnetizing current, appears
across the carrier winding. The flux densxty increases
within the core -

N, d¢=fEc dt,

until saturation is reached — from point Q to point 1 in
Fig. 6.15.12, _ ’

When the core saturates, all of the carrier voltage (£,)
appears across R; except for small voltage drops across
the carrier winding and diode CR.

When the carrier voltage changes polarity, diode CR is
reverse-biased, and the energy stored in the magnetic
amplifier develops a polarity across the carrier winding
which attempts to maintain J,. Since diode CR is
reverse-biased, I, decreases to a value equal to the
leakage current through the diode. As the induced
voltage across the carrier winding decreases, a condition
is reached where I N, = I, N}, and point 2 on the B-H
loop (Fig. 6.15.12) is reached.

The action continues, and I, /N, becomes greater than
I.N, until, at the end of the negative carrier voltage half
cycle, the operating point of the core returns to Q (Fig.
6.15.12) and the cycle repeats.

The operating point, or reset point, of the core is
determined, therefore, by the algebraic sum of the
ampere-turns of all windings on the core. If the bias
current (f) is reduced, the magnetic amplifier would
reset to point 4, and a higher output voltage would
appear across R;. Conversely, if the bias current is -
increased, reset would be at point B, and a lower output
voltage would appear across R .

In the operations monitor system, the magnetic
amplifiers and associated circuitry of the alarm modules
(Fig. 6.15.10) provide high amplification of the indi-
vidual input signals. The amplification factor (Z,) is the
transfer impedance of the magnetic amplifier, and, for
any input current [; to the input winding, an output
voltage E, is produced across the output winding:

E

o
Zt:T.
{

A positive feedback circuit causes the magnetic
amplifier to latch in the alarm state whenever the input
signal exceeds the set point.

Reset action is obtained by applying a pulse to a
transistor connected across the reset winding. This
effectively shorts the reset winding and reduces the
amplifier gain to zero.
 

 

 

 

 

> As stated previously, the magnetic amplifier in the
alarm module has two cores. Each of these cores has
separate output bias and balance windings. However,
the input, limit-set, reset, and feedback windings are
common to both cores and are wound so that current in

these windings will aid the bias in one core and oppose

the bias in the other core. In this manner, the
differential output characteristics are obtained. The
number of turns on each core is the same. ,
6.15.3.3 Control module. The operation of the mag-
netic amplifier in the control module, shown schemati-
cally in Fig. 6.15.13, is the same as that of the alarm
modules except that positive feedback is not used. The
output voltage from the balanced magnetic amplifier is
applied to the input of a transformer-coupled differ-
ential amplifier which drives a polarity-sensitive gate
circuit. The gate drives a one-shot multivibrator, which
drives the indicator lights and any external control
circuitry. : o
During an in-limit condmon the magnetlc amphﬁer
produces positive pulses at the input to the gate that are
passed and inverted by the gate. This train of pulses
triggers the one-shot and causes the green in-limit light
to glow brightly and the amber light to glow dim and
provides voltage for an external load or control device.

When an out-of-limit condition is present, the output

polarity of the magnetic amplifier reverses, producing
negative pulses at the gate input which are inhibited by
the gate and causing the one-shot to revert to its static
state. The amber light glows brightly, the green light

goes out, and any external 1nd1cat1ng or control devxce

is deenergized.

6.15.3.4 Power supply. The dc power supply consists
of a full-wave bridge rectifier and two series regulator
circuits. Design and ‘operation of these eircuits is
conventlonal Components are all-solid-state:

- The carrier power signal is obtained by generatmg a
1-kHz square-wave - signal with a transistor' multivi-
* brator. An intermediate buffer amplifier and trans-
- former are used to prevent loading of the oscillator and
to split the signal into two signals which are 180° out of
phase. These signals are used to gate power transistors
which supply ‘the carrier signals to the magnetlc
-amplifier. -

6.15.3.5 Master alarm The master alarm cxreuxts
‘consist of two transistorized “
produce a dc output voltage if an alarm condition exists

in any one of the alarm modules. One circuit is sensitive -

to low alarm conditions. The other is sensitive to high
“alarm conditions. OQutputs of the two gates ‘activate
separate high and low alarm lamps and provide separate
dc voltages for use in activating external alarm devices.

6.16 PUMP SPEED MON]TOR
6. 16 1 lntroductlon ;

The rotational speed of the fuel and coolant pumps is
measured and displayed by special speed monitoring
equipment. In addition, the pump spéed is recorded by
the data logger in revolutions per minute. Alarm and

 
 

 

 

 

control signals (see Sects. 4.2.2 and 4.2.3 for details on
the alarm and control circuits) are produced when the
speed of either pump falls below a preset value.

There are two complete channels of instrumentation
for each pump to provide operating reliability. They are
identified as SE-FP-E1 and SE-FP-E2 for the fuel pump
and SE-CP-G1 and SE-CP-G2 for the coolant pump (see
Sect. 7.1 for details on the instrument identification
and numbering system). Each channel of instrumen-
tation consists of a speed detector and a special linear
count-rate meter called a pump speed monitor.

6.16.2 Speed Detector

The detector unit is located close to a 7-in.-diam,
60-tooth gear attached to the pump impeller drive
shaft. There are two detectors for each pump. The
detector (obtained commercially from Electro Products
Laboratories, Inc.) consists of a round bar permanent
magnet with many turns of fine wire wound around it.
The coil thus formed is enclosed in a stainless steel
housing which is Heliarc welded on one end (Fig.
6.16.1). This end screws into a bracket mounted in the
pump shaft housing. The other end has 10 ft of %-in.
stainless-steel-sheathed, mineral-insulated two-conduc-
tor. cable welded to it. This cable passes through the
pump shaft housing and is welded to it. The coil and
cable insulation are made of material which can
withstand greater than 200°F temperature and a gamma
flux of 10° R/hr. The entire detector, including the
cable, has a leak rate for helium of less than 1072 cc/sec
at 50 psi. The dimensions of the unit are shown in Fig.
6.16.1. Since the pickup unit (detector) and gear
comprise an impulse generator, the spacing between the
end of the pickup and gear teeth is important. The
output signal amplitude produced is dependent upon
this spacing and the rotational speed of the gear (Fig.
6.16.2). The signal produced is an approximate sine
wave whose frequency is proportional to the pump
speed. A single sine wave is produced for each tooth in
the gear. Therefore, there are 60 sine waves per
revolution of the gear. The gear teeth are especially cut.
All teeth are the same except three. These are made
with the width between it and the adjacent tooth much
wider than normal. Two of these are placed 60° apart
and the otheér approximately 175° clockwise from the
second tooth.! By obsemng the output signal of the
pickup on an oscilloscope, the rotational direction of
the pump can be determined as shown in Fig. 6.16.2.

6. 16 3 Pump Speed Momtor

The special rate-meter used to measure and mdlcate
the signal from the pickup is called a pump speed

-

monitor. The units used were obtained from equipment
already on hand; therefore, two types are used. The two
types are basically the same in operating principle but
different in detail design and appearance.

The monitors contain circuitry. to amplify the speed
signal. The amplified signal is used to drive a Schmitt
trigger, and the resultant pulse is shaped and used to
drive a scale-of-2 pulser. The output of the pulser is fed
to a count rate circuit whose output is a dc voltage
proportional to the frequency of the speed signal. The
dc signal varies from 0 to 100 V for full-scale output.
The rate-meter output signal can be displayed by an
external recorder (0 to 10 mV), a voltmeter on the
monitor panel, and a remote meter calibrated for 0 to
2000 rpm full scale.

The speeds of the fuel and coolant pumps of the
MSRE are displayed by the meters on the front panel of
each pump speed monitor and by a remote meter from
one monitor on each pump. The remote meters are
located on the main control panel. In addition, the
signals from all monitors are checked for alarms and
recorded by the data logger and output on the 8-hr log.

The Q-1724-27 model VII monitor used on the fuel
pump is shown in Fig. 6.16.3. This monitor contains a
precision bridge with a null voltmeter which can be
used to determine speed variations precisely from a
preset reference. The accuracy with the null meter is
+*,%, and with the large meter, £1%. This unit also
contains three separate alarm set points, associated
alarm lights, and double-pole, double-throw relays.
Each alarm is independent and may be set over the full
range of the instrument, 0 to 2000 rpm.

The Q-1724-28 model VIII monitor, used in the
coolant pump, is shown in Fig. 6.16.4. This monitor is
essentially the same as the Q-1724-27 model VII but
differs in that it has only two alarms, does not have the
null or deviation meter, and uses miniature tubes. Both
models have a 1-in. oscilloscope mounted on the left of
the front panel to display the output signal from the
speed detector. The horizontal sweep is driven by the
60-cycle line voltage. Both models also contain . a
precision tuning fork oscillator set at a frequency
equivalent to 1000 rpm for a calibration signal.

Details of the pump speed monitor circuits are shown

6.17 PUMP NOISE MONITOR (MICROPHONES)
6.17.1 Introduction

‘Figure 6.17.1 shows a microphone assembly which is
used to monitor noise in the fuel- and coolant-salt
pumps. Two.microphones of this type are attached to
the motor housing ‘of each pump. The microphones are
of the dynamic type and are constructed of radiation-
resistant materials. Bearing noises and vibrations are
detected by the microphone and transduced to propor-

~ tional electrical signals.

All microphones are connected to a common selector
switch in the auxiliary control room. The selected signal
is then amplified and used to drive a speaker and a
decibel meter. The type of noise is determined by
listening to the speaker, and the level is determined by
observing the decibel meter. Additional information can
be obtained by observing the signal on an oscilloscope.
- A two-wire shielded cable is used to transmit the
signal from the microphone to the control area. An
inorganic-insulated cable® is used for this service inside
the reactor cell. The low output impedance of the
dynamic microphones minimizes the effects-of stray
magnetic field and deterioration of cable .insulation
resistance. For this reason, no special shielding was
required in the -MSRE microphone circuits, and a
considerable amount of moisture absorptmn can be
tolerated in the cable.

To satisfy requirements for remote mamtenance or
removal of the fuel-salt pump, the microphone cables
are routed through disconnects of the type described in
Sect. 6.18.

Techniques similar to those described in Sect. 6.7 are
used to seal the rmcrophone cable penetratlon of the
reactor containment vessel.

6.17. 2 Mlcrophone Constructlon

The m:crophone assembly (Fig. 6.17.1) consists of a. -

small dynamic microphone encased in a stainless steel
housing and held in place by a spring. The microphone
coil is constructed of Formvar-insulated copper wire
and is encapsulated in a ceramic cartridge with a
ceramlc potting compound The coil surrounds a
magnetic armature, which is attached to a-diaphragm on
the face of the cartridge. Acoustical noise and Vibra-

tions are transmitted from a stud on the housmg,r

through the housing and diaphragm, to the armature
and causé movement of ther armature within the coil.

 

*Manufactured by the Rockbestos Wire and Cable Company.

This movement induces a signal voltage in the coil
which is analogous to the monitored noise or vibration
when the coil is properly loaded.

The microphone cartridge was supplied by the Telex
Corporation in accordance with ORNL specifications
and is similar to the Telex model 18056 cartridge.

6.18 IN-CELL INSTRUMENT DISCONNECTS
6.18.1 General

Instrument disconnects, including both electrical and
pneumatic, located inside the reactor and drain tank
cells, were selected or designed for compatibility with
remote handling tools and a high-level radiation en-
vironment. Each disconnect consists of a fixed and a
movable half installed in a manner to facilitate the
removal of equipment for either maintenance or re-
placement. Maintenance equipment and procedures are
described in ORNL-TM-910,! pp. 37, 40, and 75.

6.18.2 Electrical Disconnects

The six-circuit thermocouple disconnect described in
Sect. 6.7.7 is also used where in-cell disconnects are
required in instrument electrical circuits. The use of a
single type of disconnect for all circuits was preferred
for simplification of installation and remote handling
requirements. Some installations required modifications
to accommodate different types of cable and end seals,
Where a 12-pin plug and jack are connected to a two- or
three-conductor cable, several pins are connected in
parallel to one conductor. This arrangement makes

“maximum use of the available contact surface. A typical

disconnect with a three-conductor. cable is shown in
Fig. 6.18.1.2 Thermoelectric effects- due to the dis-
similar plug and jack materials (Chromel and Alumel)
are either canceled or reduced to a minimum in the dc
circuits by the proper connection of wires and are
ineffective in ac circuits. :

- 6.18.2.1 Valve-position indicator c1rcu1t dlsconnect
The type B disconnect shown in Fig. 6.18.1 is used in
the valve-position ‘indicator circuits. A: typical in-cell
valve installation is shown in Fig. 6.18.2. Two alu-
minum housings are stacked together to form the top

 
 

 

 

half (female) of the disconnect. In this case, the second
box serves as an adapter which provides space for
accommodating the end seal of the mineral-insulated
cable connected to it. These cables are routed through
the cell penetrations from a junction box outside the
cell and are connected to the female disconnects with
sufficient slack to allow movement for disconnection.
The bottom half (male) of the disconnect is fixed to a
support plate attached to the valve and is removable
with the valve. The position indicator switches are
connected to the male disconnect with an inorganic-
insulated cable (Micatemp — manufactured by Rock-
bestos Wire and Cable Company) run through %-in.-OD
copper tubing which is attached to the bottom side of
the disconnect housing with a swage-type compression
tube fitting. No end seals are used on these cables.

6.18.2.2 Drain tank level probe circuit disconnect.
The drain tank level probe circuits (see Sect. 6.10) are
wired with mineral-insulated cable connected to both
~ halves of the type A disconnect as shown in Fig.
6.18.1.2 The mineral-insulated cable and end seals are
the same as shown for type B, but instead of stacking
two housings, a pipe adapter protruding from the wall
of a single housing is used to accommodate the end
seals. The upper half (female) of the disconnect is
connected to the level probe, which is removable. The
lower half (male) of the disconnect is mounted on a
fixed support and is connected to the cable, which
extends through the cell penetration to the terminal
box outside the cell.

6.18.2.3 Fuel pump speed indicator circuit dis-
connect. Due to space limitation and lead-wire cable
interference with other equipment near the fuel pump,
the three fuel pump speed indicator circuits are served
by two disconnects connected in series with jumper
cables.>. One disconnect, enclosed in a stainless steel
housing, is supported from the motor flange of the
pumnp bearing housing. The other disconnect, enclosed

in an aluminum housing, is located near the reactor cell

wall. The upper halves (female) of both disconnects and
their jumper cables may be removed to permit main-
tenance of other equipment. The two disconnects are
fitted with partitions which separate the three channels
from each other, as required for wiring in the safety
system, of which these circuits are an integral part. The
lower half (male) of the disconnect, mounted on the
pump, is connected to the speed elements with mineral-
insulated cables sheathed in Y,-in.-OD stainless steel
tubing. The ends of these cables are sealed with Physical
Science Corporation 0900 glaze compound. The lower
half (male) of the:disconnect, mounted on a fixed
support near the cell wall, is connected to Micatemp

360

(inorganic insulation) cables inserted in Y-in.-OD
copper tubing and routed through the cell penetrations
to a junction box outside the reactor cell. The
disconnect ends of these cables have glass-to-metal seals,
and the junction box ends have epoxy seals similar to
thermocouple cables shown in Fig. 6.7.21. The jumper
cables consist of Micatemp cables run in Y-in.-OD
copper tubing and have no end seals since both ends
terminate inside the cell. Details of these disconnects
are shown on ORNL drawing D-HH-Z41784.*

6.18.3 Instrument Air Line Disconnects

Figures 6.18.34 and 6.18.3B show details of dis-
connects used for connecting instrument air lines to
pneumatic control valves located in the reactor and
drain tank cells. The original disconnects (identified in
the figures as existing) were a commercial type fitted
with elastomer seals. They can also be seen in Fig.
6.18.2, which shows a typical valve installation. Leaks
developed in these disconnects after a period of
operation due to embrittlement of the elastomer.!?
Modifications were made to eliminate the elastomer
seals as shown in the figures,

Figure 6.18.4 shows the type of disconnect used in

| leak detector lines and in lines connected to the

'6.19 HELIUM FLOW ELEMENTS
~ AND RESTRICTORS

6.19.1 Introduction ‘

Hehum flow rates in the MSRE are measured in the
main helnum supply line and in the fuel and coolant .

system pump purge and upper gas letdown lines.
Normal operating flow rates in, these lines range from a
maximum of 10 scfm in the supply line to less than 0.1
scfm in the upper gas letdown lines. Matrix-type flow
elements of the type shown in Fig. 6.19.1 are used to

measure these low flows. The matrix element consists

basically. of a packed bed of small glass spheres. Flow of
helium through this bed produces a pressure drop which
is proportional to the flow rate. Differential pressure
transmitters of the type described in Sect. 6.3 are used
to measure this pressure drop.

The use of matrix flow elements in the MSRE offered
the following advantages over the orifice, venturi, and

. capillary-type flow elements commonly used_for gas
flow measurements:

1. The matrix-type element is easier to fabricate and
is less susceptible to plugging than the other types, since

The - capillary-type flow element was the second
choice for measurement of MSRE helium flow and was
used for gas flow measurement in the chemical process
system and the cell air ‘evacuation line. )

Figure '6.19.2 shows a capillary element used ex-
tensively for helium flow restriction in the fuel sampler-
enricher and chemical process sampler systems, the fuel
and coolant salt system bubbler-purge and upper gas
letdown lines, and the fuel salt system drain tank
supply lines (see Sects. 3.1 through 3.5, 3.12, and 6.8).
In these applications, the requirements for calibration
accuracy are less demanding than for the flow elements
discussed above, and pressure taps are not required.
Maximum flow rates in these applications range from
70 scfm in the smallest restnctor to 10,000 scfm in the
largest.

Because of the reduced accuracy requirements and
the elimination of pressure taps, the construction of
capillary restrictors is simpler than that of matrix flow
restrictors, fabrication is easier, and cost is considerably
reduced. These considerations weighed heavily in favor
of using capillary elements for flow restriction mstead
of matrix-type elements.

Since most of the flow elements and restrictors are -
located in lines containing radioactive gases, weld-sealed
construction is used, and connections are made w1th
hehum leak-tlght (autoc]ave) ﬁttmgs

- 6.19.2 Construction

6.19.2.1 Matrix-type flow element. The flow element
shown in Fig. 6.19.1 conisists basically of a packed bed -
of small glass spheres contained in a section of stainless
steel pipe. Dutch twill filter screens at each end of the
matrix (packed bed) contain the glass beads and prevent
the passage of particulates which could alter the
characteristics of the element. The relatively large area
of ithe filter screens, as compared to the port area of
similarly sized orifices or capillary elements, reduces the
probability of plugging. Process connections are made

by end pieces welded to the pipe and machined to mate

very small inside diameters are required to obtain
adequate dxfferenhal pressure sxgnals from onﬁces, .

venturis, or capillaries at the low MSRE flow rates.

2. The signal produced by the matrix-type element is |

a linear functnon of flow. The signal produced by the

caplllary-type element is also linear ‘when properly 7
sized, and in this respect the matrix-type element offers

no advantage over the capillary. Orifices and venturis,
however, have square root characteristics which must be
compensated when data are used for computation and
which result in reduced accuracy at lower flow rates.

with standard autoclave fittings. Pressure taps are
welded to the pipe between the filter screens at points
within the matrix. By locating the taps in this manner,
the effects of pressure drops across the filter screens
and end effects on the flow characteristics of the matrix
are eliminated. The signal measured is therefore the
pressure drop across a section within the matrix. Filter

_screens are also provided at the taps to contain the bed
~and to prevent particulate contamination of the bed.

The taps are constructed of standard autoclave tubing
and are shaped and prepared for mating directly with
 

 

 

 

female autoclave-type fittings machined in the body of
the differential pressure cell. In some cases, the taps
were bent or shortened in the field to conform with
individual installation requirements. All weld joints
were designed to permit full penetration of the weld
metal. :

The matrix ﬂow elements used in the MSRE were
fabncated by the Hanover Instrument Company* in
accordance with ORNL specifications. The matrix
section of the element is a proprietary item for which
Hanover has a patent pending.

362

6.19.2,2 Capillary flow restrictors. The flow re- .

strictor shown in Fig. 6.19.2 consists of a coiled section
of stainless steel capillary tubing enclosed in a sealed
protective housing and provided with end fittings for
connection to process lines. The end fittings are
machined to mate with standard autoclave fittings and
drilled to match the outside diameter of the capillary.
The capillary extends through the fitting and is welded
at the tip end. Considerable care was required in making
the weld to avoid altering the inside diameter of the
capillary at the tip. Final coning of the fitting was done
after the weld was made. The housing consists of two
modified pipe caps welded to a section of pipe and to
the end fittings. This housing serves three purposes. It
provides a means of testing the assembly for leaks with
a mass-spectrometer-type leak detector, it provides
protection against mechanical damage to the capillary,
and it will provide additional protection against leakage
of helium or radioactive gases if a leak develops in the
capillary during reactor operation. All materials used in
the flow restrictor assembly are 300-series stainless
steels,

6.19.3 Flow Characteristics

6.19.3.1 Matrix-type flow element. When flow in the
element is laminar, the differential pressure signal
produced by the matrix flow element is given by the
express1on

K, QLy*(1 —e€)?

where

AP = pressure drop,

K = constant,

 

*Croydon, Pa.; formerly Hughes Instrument Company.

A = cross-sectional area of the matrix, ’
Q = volumetric gas flow rate (actual),
L = matrix layer thickness,
y = shape constant,
e = relative void volume,
D, = particle diameter,
g = acceleration,
u = viscosity (absolute).

For a given matrix configuration, factors 4, L, y, e, Dp,
and g are constant and Eq. (1) reduces to:

AP=K'Qu, )
where K’ is a meter constant.

Equation (2) shows that the differential pressure
signal is proportional to the volumetric flow rate and to
the viscosity. Since viscosity is a function of temper-
ature, the gas temperature must be known to obtain the
true volumetric flow rate.

The volume rate measured is the actual volume at
absolute pressure and temperature; thus pressure and
temperature corrections are necessary to convert to
standard volume units. Also, the above expressions
[Egs. (1) and (2)] assume that the pressure is equal
throughout the matrix. In actual practice, a pressure
drop exists in the matrix, and the following relationship
applies:

0.0, (1-9) =0

where

(3)

Q. = corrected flow,
@, = measured flow,
AP = pressure drop,

P, = pressure at the upstream tap. |

In most MSRE applications the pressure term is very
large in comparison to the pressure drop, and the
correction factor (A) can be 1gnored

flow conditions exist in the capillary, the flow through
the capillary is given by the expression:

where

Q = volumetric gas flow rate (standard.units),
P, = upstream pressure (absolute),
P, = downstream pressure (absolute),
AP = pressure drop,
d = capillary inside diameter,"
L = capillary length,
K = proportionality constant,
K = viscosity,
T = temperature (absolute).

Since d and L are constant for a given capillary and
since P, = 2P, — AP, Eq. (4) can be reduced to:

Q=K(2P, AP)AP, )
uT
where K’ is a meter constant.

Equation (5) shows that, when the pressure drop i is
small in comparison to the operating pressure, the flow
is directly proportional to the pressure drop. This
condition usually applies when capillaries are used for
flow measurement but does not apply in the case of
flow restrictors which have appreciable pressure drop.
For this reason, the flow characteristics of the MSRE
flow restrictors are slightly nonlinear. _

Equation (5) also shows that the flow rate is a
function of inlet pressure, viscosity, and temperature.
In MSRE applications, these parameters are relatively
constant and do not present a problem.

From Eq. (4), it should be noted that the flow rate is
directly proportional to the fourth power of the inside
diameter and inversely proportional to the first power

~ of the length. From this it is apparent that doubling the
. inside diameter requires the length to be changed by a

factor of 16 to obtain the same flow characteristics. For
this reason, capillaries with very small inside diameters

(0.006 to 0.050 in.) were requn'ed for the low MSRE

flow rates

6.20 ELECTRIC SOLENOID VALVE,
WELD-SEALED

6.20.1 Introduction

The weld-sealed electric solenoid valves shown in Fig.
6.20.1 are for service in the helium cover gas system,
where a high degree of cleanliness, absolute contain-

. ment of the process fluid, and tight shutoff character-
istics are required. In the MSRE, they are used for
primary containment block valves in small, low-capacity
helium purge lines such as the fuel- and coolant-salt
bubbler level system supply, fuel pump bowl cover gas
supply, and sampler-enricher purge supply. They also
serve as block valves in the lines connecting the off-gas
sampler to the fuel off-gas line and in the fuel
samplemnmcher off-gas system.

6.20.2 Physical Construction and
Performance Characteristics

_' The valves are of two classifications designated as
follows:

Type I — process connections: Autoclave Engineers,
Inc., %-in., 30,000 psi rating; port size, % ,-in. diam-
eter (see Fig. 6.20.2).

Type Il — process connections: '4-in. sched 40 pipe
nipples; port size, %-in. diameter (see Fig. 6.20.3).

Except for these distinguishing features, the construc-
tion of both the type 1 and the type III valves is
identical. They are packless direct -solenoid-operated
normally closed globe-type shutoff valves. Each valve
unit consists of a weld-sealed subassembly and separate
removable solenoid assembly. The design pressure rating
of the valve body is 200 psig at 200°F. The operating
pressure range is 29 in. Hg vacuum to 50 psig. The
maximum differential pressure for the type I valve is 50
psig applied to either side of the seat. For the type Il
- valve, which has the larger port opening, it is 50 psig if

applied over the seat and only 30 psig if applied under

the seat. The type Ill valve is designed for use in the
fuel sampler-enricher vacuum system, where the larger
port opening helps to reduce the pumping time required
~ to produce high vacuum pressures. The actuating coil,
enclosed in a weatherproof - housing, - is rated for
continuous operation with 48 V dc applied. Power

 
 

 

consumption is approximately 50 W. When the coil is
deenergized, the force exerted by the coil spring on the
plunger holds the O-ring seal against the port seat, and
the valve is closed. When the coil is energized, the
resulting magnetic force, acting on the plunger, over-
comes the spring force plus the force exerted by
pressure applied over the seat; the plunger moves
upward, lifting the O-ring seal off the port seat to open
the valve.

Although the valve design is conventional, several
unique features make it a high-performance component
of exceptional quality. First, the weld-sealed joint

364

between the bobbin insert and the valve body assures

the absolute containment of the process fluid. On the
type III valve, the '"4-in. pipe nipples are also seal-
-welded to the valve body. Second, strict procedures
governing material composition, cleanliness, and fabri-
cation methods were observed during the construction
and testing operations. Finally, each valve was subjected
to rigid performance tests before it was accepted for use
in the reactor system. Leak tests with a mass spectrom-
eter demonstrated that the leakage of process fluid
from each valve body is less than 1 X 1078 cc of helium
per second and through each seat is less than 1 X 1078
cc of helium per second.

The design, fabrication, and testing of these valves are
described by the company specifications’ and the
vendor’s construction drawings and test reports.2

6.21 THERMOCOUPLE TEST ASSEMBLY FOR
TEMPERATURE SAFETY CHANNELS

The ORNL Standard for the Design of Reliable
Reactor Protective Systems' requires that class A safety
or protective systems* shall be provided with built-in
monitoring or testing equipment such that the opera-
bility of each channel can be verified during operation
of the plant. Further requirements include the fol-
lowing:

1. The test shall include as much of the system as
possible; that is, it is desirable that the flux. or
temperature, for example, be perturbed so as to
include the sensor and, where possible, the final
safety actuator such as safety rod or valve be

actuated.

. The test shall simulate as faithfully as possible the
-actual behavior of the parameter.

. The test shall not interfere with the correct opera-
tion of the channel during test; that is, the test signal
shall supplement or be superimposed on the normal
signal.

. Frequency of tests shall be related to the predicted
or experienced failure rate.

. The system employed for ‘testing must be so
arranged as to constitute minimal breach of channel
isolation. If the system for testing is common to
otherwise separate channels of a safety system, the
layout shall be such as to not increase the proba-
bility of a single fault failing all channels. Failures
originating in the test equipment shall not affect the
safe operation of more than a single channe].

 

*Class A systems are applicable to plants with Iong operating
cycles, whereas class B systems are applicable only to plants
having short operating cycles. :
 

 

 

 

6. Where possible and practical, performance of the
test shall not require disassembly of the channel.t

Since the MSRE reactor outlet temperature and

radiator outlet temperature safety channels fall -within\_
the definition of class A system, the above requirements

were applicable. In these instances, however, testing of
individual channels by perturbing the process tempera-
ture was not possible, and no means of perturbing
individual sensor temperatures was apparent which was
practical and consistent with operational and Instru-
mentation and Controls Division requirements. It was
therefore decided that tests would be made by per-
turbing the signal.

To ‘produce the required s1gnal perturbatlon in a
manner consistent with the requirements of the stand-
ards, the device shown in Fig. 6.2]1.1 was developed.
The device consists of a vacuum thermocouple assembly
of the type frequently used to measure the rms value of
if currents and an associated transformer and push-
button switch. The vacuum thermocouple consists of a
fine-wire heater supported at each end, with a fine-wire
thermocouple attached to its center by a ceramic bead.
This whole assembly is sealed in an evacuated glass
bulb. By passing a current through the heater, an

electromotive force (emf) is generated by the thermo-
couple. The emf generated is approximately 0.07.

mV/mA, with the maximum permissible current being

200 mA. Thus the full-range output is approximately

14 mV, which is equivalent to 560° on the Chromel-
Alumel thermocouple scale. Leads of the device may be
connected to simulate either a temperature increase or
decrease, depending on the polarity of the voltage
output.

Use of this: device permits tests to.be performed
without. disconnecting any wire. Construction is such

that physical separation and electrical isolation of
redundant safety channels is maintained, and thereisno

apparent mechanism by which a failure in the test
device could cause an unsafe failure of the assocmted
safety channel. -

portions of a channel to conduct these tests, provision shall be
made to verify the proper reassembly of the channel.

6.22 CLOSED-CIRCUIT TELEVISION SYSTEM
FOR REMOTE MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS

6.22.1 Introduction

The ease with which maintenance of radioactive
systems can be performed is strongly dependent on the
ability to view the operation. In portions of the MSRE,
the radiation levels are very high, and viewing must be
accomplished directly through high-density windows or
indirectly by means of optical devices or closed-circuit
television. In most cases, the use of windows or optical
devices is preferred; however, in some cases, supple-
mentary viewing with closed-circuit television is neces-

- sary.

The use of television in MSRE maintenance opera-
tions is presently limited to those operations associated
with removal of large components. For these opera-
tions, large cell access openings are required, and the
maintenance operations must be performed remotely
from a shielded maintenance control room. To supple-
ment the direct view available through windows in the
maintenance control room, a radiation-resistant closed-
circuit television system was provided.

~ 6.22.2 Design Considerations

Since remote maintenance operations are often
lengthy and complex and since the consequences of
mistakes can be serious, it is imperative that the
television equipment used in these operations provide
the operator with as much information as possible and
not cause undue fatigue. It is also important that the
equipment be in operating condition when needed. To
avoid operator fatigue, the equipment must be easy to
operate and capable of producing stable, high-quality
pictures under- a variety of lighting conditions. To
obtain- maximum information, good picture resolution
and a means’ of determining distance or depth are
required. To ensure that the equipment will operate
when needed, the equipment must be rugged, reliable,
and compatible with environmental conditions.

The requirements for ease of operation, picture
quality- and stability, ruggedness, reliability, and envi-

-ronmental compatibility dictated the use of a high-

performance system with radiation-resistant cameras
and with auxiliary electronic and control equipment
consolidated at a centrahzed Iocauon and, to some
extent, automated. -

The Tequirements for depth perception dictated the
use of either a three-dimensional (3D) system or an
orthogonal (right angle) viewing system. Both types of

 
 

 

 

 

systems were tested in the molten-salt remote mainte-
nance demonstration facility.

Two types of three-dimensional viewing were tested —
a single camera and a two-camera system. While good
three-dimensional effects were obtained with both 3D
systems under certain conditions, it was found that an
excessive amount of maintenance and operational ad-
justments was required to prevent the occurrence of
eyestrain and operator fatigue after prolonged use of
the equipment. It was also found that the ability to
perceive three-dimensional effects varied with the indi-

- vidual operator and that some were incapable of

perceiving any effect.

In the orthogonal system, the operation is viewed
from two directions (preferably at right angles) with
two separate camera systems, and the signals from the
two cameras are displayed on separate monitors. No
problems were encountered in tests of this system other
than the need to have an unobstructed view of the

366

operation from two directions and the need to watch

two monitors simultaneously. In tests involving the
movement of large components, these limitations did
not present serious difficulties. '

From these tests it was concluded that orthogonal
viewing was preferable to three-dimensional viewing for
MSRE maintenance operations, and the MSRE system
was designed accordingly.

The design of the MSRE system and the selection and
procurement of components were also influenced by
prior experience at ORNL with the use of closed-circuit
television in maintenance operation at the Homo-
geneous Reactor Test.! The design was additionally
influenced by experience with the orthogonal viewing
technique gained by others in similar operations at
Atomics International. ,

- The HRT operations demonstrated that the use of
television for viewing in high-level radiation environ-
ments was practical. The experience at Atomics Inter-

_national demonstrated that orthogonal viewing was

preferable to three-dimensional viewing for remote
maintenance operations. Both operations demonstrated
that systems used for remote maintenance must be
rugged and easy to operate and must have a high degree
of performance and reliability.

6.22.3 System Description

Figure 6.22.1 shows a camera assembly used in MSRE
maintenance operations. The assembly consists of a
Kintel model 2512 camera, a Wollensak nonbrowning
zoom lens, a preamplifier, and the necessary intercon-
nection and control cables. The camera and the

preamplifier are mounted on portable stands which can
be moved by use of an overhead crane. Three camera
systems were provided, one of which functions as an
operating spare. The cameras are radiation and shock
resistant and will withstand continuous exposure to
1-MeV gamma radiation, of the order of 10° R/hr, for
100 hr with little degradation of performance. Replace-
ment of the Vidicon and the lens will restore the
camera performance until the camera has accumulated a
radiation dosage of 10? R. Each camera is connected by
50 ft of radiation-resistant cable to the preamplifier,
which, in turn, is connected by a 100-ft cable to a
camera control unit. The preamplifier is not radiation
resistant and must be shielded from high-level radiation.
The camera control units for the three cameras are
mounted in a console in the mainténance control room
together with the monitors and associated camera
controls. Figure 6.22.2 shows the assembled console.
Although three camera systems are installed, only two
monitors are used. A video switching system permits
the operator to display the signal from'any of the three
cameras on either or both monitors. The “joy stick”
controls mounted on the front of the console table
enable the operator to control pan, tilt, focus, and

zoom motions with wrist and finger actions. Other, less
frequently used, controls and adjustments are located

on the sloping panel in front of the operator. Space was
provided on the table for the addition of crane controls.

Figure 6.22.3 shows the console panel. Adjustments
and controls for the camera video and sweep circuits are
located in the camera control units located in the lower
section of the panel. All commonly used adjustments
are available at the front of the panel. These adjust-
ments are used primarily for initial setup of the
equipment. When the automatic target control feature
is used to compensate for variations in lighting, little
adjustment is required during operation. The video
switching panel, shown at lower right, is used to select
the desired combination of monitors and cameras. The
camera control units utilize plug-in construction and,
except for the addition of the video switching unit, are
standard Kintel 3900-series assemblies. The pan and tilt
control units (upper right and left center) are standard
ITT model PT-H-1 assemblies that have been modified
to permit pan and tilt action to be performed by the
joy stick. A local-remote switch enables the operator to
select local (front panel) control or remote (joy stick)
control. The Wollensak zoom lens controls, at upper
left, have also been modified to permit joy stick
operation. Remote operation of the lens is accom-
plished with a solenoid-operated cable assembly. This
cable assembly does not interfere with local operation

O

 
 

 

of the lens control switches, and a local-remote switch
was not needed.

Except for the Vidicon and a small (Nuv1st0r) vacuum
tube in the camera, the system uses solid-state com-
ponents throughout.

6.22.4 Performance Characteristics

The complete system produces high-quality pictures,
and performance is stable over a wide range of variation
of line voltage, line frequency, ambient temperature,
and humidity. Some of the more important perform-
ance characteristics are listed below. Additional details
are given in Refs. 1 through 6. '

Horizontal resolution — 650 lines in the center of the
picture and 550 lines in the corner.

Vertical resolution — 350 lines in the center and corners
of the picture. |

Geometry distortion — less than 2% of picture height.

Sensitivity (with 1-in. focal length, f/1.5 lens) — 400
lines horizontal resolution with 1-ft-c average scene
“illumination; 1 V negative video and 0.4 V sync signal
with 10 ft-c.

Scanning standard — 525 lines, 2.1 interlace, with a
vertical field frequency of 60 cps and a vertical frame
frequency of 30 cps.

Synchronization generator — Produces pulses in accord-
ance with recommendations of EIA standard RS-170.
Horizontal and vertical pulses are obtained by count
down from master oscillator frequency. Line-locked
or free-running operation. '

Automatic light compensation — Less than 6 dB video
amplitude variation over range of scene illumination
variation from 5 ft-c to 10,000 ft-c, with a full-range
adjustment time of 0.25 sec.

Camera radiation tolerance (standard Vidicon) — 550

~ lines resolution after 107 R accumulated dose (1-MeV

gamma). Replacement of Vidicon and/or -lens will
restore the caméra performance until the camera has
accumulated a dose of 10° R (1-MeV gamma). Use of
Vidicon with nonbrowning faceplate will extend
allowable dosage before Vidicon replacement.

Lens radiation tolerance — Less than 5% transmission
loss between 4500 A and 7000 A after 10° R
accumulated dose from 6°Co at 240 R/min. Greatest
loss occurs at shortest anelength

6.23 AUTOMATIC RANGE CHANGE CIRCUITS
FOR THE FUEL PUMP LEVEL SYSTEMS

TWo bubbler-type liquid level detecting systems are
used to measure the salt level in the MSRE fuel pump

.bowl. The level signal is obtained by measuring the

differential between the pressure in the gas space above
the molten salt and the pressure inside the dip tube.
When the tube is purged with a small gas flow, the
differential pressure produced is proportional to the
 

 

 

height of the salt above the bottom of the dip tube.
This differential pressure is measured by two Foxboro
Instrument Company E.C.I. transmitters, LT-593C and
LT-596B, as shown in Fig. 4.9.5. Each transmitter
produces a 10- to 50-mA output signal that is propor-
tional to the measured differential. The The 10- to
50-mA current is the input signal for all receiving
devices such as signal modifiers, recorders, and indi-
cators connected in the circuit. A detailed description
of the bubbler systems is given in Sects. 4.9.8 and 6.8
of this report. The Foxboro E.C.I. system is described
in Sect. 5.2.2. '

The calibration of bubbler-type level systems is based
on the assumption that the density of the liquid being
measured will remain constant, but in the MSRE, two
liquids, fuel salt and flush salt, having slightly different
densities, are used interchangeably. The two pump bowl
level systems are required to operate continuously
regardless of the type of salt in use; therefore, some
means of automatically adjusting the calibration of the
transmitters must be provided to compensate for the
change in liquid density when changing from one type
of fuel salt to the other. This is accomplished by adding
range-changing resistors to. the signal transmission cir-

368

cuit of both differential transmitters as shown in Fig.

6.23.1. The circuit is typical for both LT-593C and
LT-596B. \ | |

The range-changing resistors are connected in the
circuit when relay KB94 is energized and contacts
KB94A and KB94C are closed. Relay KB94 is energized
through circuit 94, which is also shown in Fig. 6.23.1.
When the reactor system is filled with fuel salt, the
drain tank selector switch S6 is in the FDI! or FD2
position (see Sect. 4.2.4.1). In either position, selector
switch contact S6T is open, relay KB94 is deenergized,
and the range-change resistors are not in the transmitter
signal circuit. The maximum change in fuel salt level is
equivalent to 22.4 in. H, O differential pressure.* Each
transmitter is first calibrated, with the range-change
resistor circuits open, to transmit a 50-mA output signal
when 22.4 in. H,O differential is applied. This cali-
bration, shown by curve 1 in Fig. 6.23.2, is used when
fuel salt is in the pump bowl.

When the reactor is filled with flush salt, the drain
tank selector switch S6 is in the FFT position. In this
position, switch contact S6T is closed, relay KB94 is
energized, and contacts KB94A and KB94C are both
closed. This connects resistor R, in parallel with the
transmitter feedback motor so that a portion of the

 

*For fuel salt density of 140 Ib/ft>.

amplifier current is shunted around the motor. This
unbalances the system if the applied differential pres-
sure remains the same, and the output current flowing
through the indicator and the amplifier must increase to
return the transmitter to a force-balance condition. For
example, assume that contacts KB94A and KB94C are
open and the transmitter is in a balanced condition with
22.4 in. H,0 differential applied. Under these con-
ditions, the output current in all parts of the current
loop, including the feedback motor, is SO mA. Now, if
contact KB94A is closed, the current in the feedback
motor is reduced by the amount shunted through
resistor R;, but the current from the amplifier will
automatically increase until the 50 mA needed to
rebalance the system is again flowing through the -
feedback motor. Obviously the current flowing through
the indicator and the amplifier under these conditions is
greater than 50 mA. By shunting the feedback motor,
we have increased the gain of the transmitter; that is to
say, more output current is produced per psi of applied
differential pressure. This is another way of saying that
the measuring range of the transmitter has been reduced
because some value of applied differential that is less
than 22.4 in. H,O will now produce the full-scale
current flow of 50 mA through the indicator and the
amplifier. Resistor R, can be adjusted until 19 in. H; O
differential pressure produces the full-scale current flow
of 50 mA through the indicator and the amplifier. The
calibration of the transmitter after this adjustment is
represented by curve 2 in Fig. 6.23.2. Note that this
adjustment - also shifts the zero point; that is, at zero
differential pressure, the output current is no longer 10
mA but is slightly greater than 10 mA. This condition is
corrected by applying zero differential pressure to the
transmitter and adjusting the value of resistor R,,
which is also connected in the circuit. The R, circuit
adds a small amount of current flow from the power
supply to the feedback motor, and the system main-
tains a condition of force balance by reducing the
current flow through the indicator and the amplifier.
Proper adjustment of resistor R, will return the value
of output current to 10 mA with zero differential
applied. The calibration of the transmitter after the
zero adjustment -is represented by curve -3 in Fig.
6.23.2. The span and zero adjustments interact with
one another to some extent; therefore the range and
zero adjustments must be repeated several times before
the calibration represented by curve 3 is achieved.

The transmitter now has a new measuring range.
Applied differential pressures ranging from O to 19 in.
H, O will produce a proportional 10- to 50-mA output
signal. The instrument is now calibrated for use in flush
 

369

salt, since the maxi.mum change in flush salt level is
" equivalent to 19 in. H, O differential pressure.t

In summary,. then, the fuel salt level ‘transmitters, .
LT-593C and LT-596B, have two calibrated range’

spans. One is 22.4 in. H, O differential for use when the

pump bowl contains fuel salt, and the other is 19 in. -

H, O differential for use when the-bowl contains flush
salt. The change from one range span to the other
occurs automatically when the drain tank selector
switch S6 is moved to the FFT: position from either of

 

tFor flush salt density of 118.6 Ib/ft3.

the two drain tank positions, FD i and FD2.In the FD1

- and FD2 positions (fuel salt in use), the differential

pressure transmitters are calibrated, without the range- .
change resistors shown in Fig. 6.23.1, to produce an
output signal current of 10 to 50 mA that is propor-

tional to measured diffefential pressures in the range of
0 to 22.4 in. H, 0. With switch S6 in the FFT position

(flush salt in use), the range-change resistors are
connected in the circuit, and the differential pressure

. transmitters are calibrated to produce an output signal

current of 10 to 50 mA that is proportional to

measured differential pressures in the range of 0 to 19

in. Hg 0.

7. CODING SYSTEMS AND INSTALLATION PRACTICES

T. M. Cate

7.1 INSTRUMENT NUMBER AND APPLICATIONS
- DIAGRAM CODING SYSTEMS

P.

The instrument numbering and identification system .

and the flow plan symbols used on drawings, tabula-
tions, and specifications generated by the Instru-
mentation and Controls Division for the Molten-Salt
Reactor Experiment are in most respects in accordance
with the ORNL standard system presented in
CF-57-2-1.! )

The general identification of instruments and controls
consists of two or three upper-case letters as listed in
Table 7.1.1. The list in Table 7.1.1 shows the letters
that were employed, the definition or significance of

each, and the position in which they were used. Table

7.1.2 shows the possible and acceptable combinations

of the identification letters and the meaning of each
letter group. It should be noted that in column 5 of
Table 7.1.1 some specific identification letters in lower
case are listed. These lower-case specific identification
letters were in some cases used as subscripts to the first
identification letter in order to more clearly define an
instrument’s specific use. '

A numbering system of identification to supplement
the letter identification was used in order to establish
specrflc identity. ‘

" The numbering and specific identity system used for

G. Herndon

In many cases, instrument systems were associated
with vessels, pumps, and other equipment, instead of

‘lines. In these cases, virtually every piece of equipment

in the reactor system was assigned an abbreviated
identification symbol,.consisting in most cases of, two
or three upper-case letters. A list of these is given in
Part I of this report.? In cases where an instrument is
attached to specific pieces of equipment, the identifi-
cation symbol was made a part of the instrument
number in the same manner as line numbers were
included in- instrument numbers of an instrument
attached or assoclated with a line. '

In situations where more than one instrument loop
was associated with a line, vessel, or piece of equip-

~ ment, an additional upper-case letter was added, with a

hyphen between the instrument identification number
and the letter, These letters are used in alphabetlcal
order.

The occasion arose in several instances where two
instruments in the same instrument loop would require
the same number. In this situation, an additional arabic

- numeral was added to the instrument identification

the MSRE was not the system recommended in

'Appendlx A of CF-57-2-1." In the MSRE numbering

and specific ‘identity system, blocks of numbers were
assigned to various systems in the reactor for use as line

. or piping identification. An attempt was then made to

make instrument numbers coincide with the line num-
bers wherever. possible; that is, where an instrument is

Vassoc1ated with a line, it carries the. same number as the

line, Table 7.1.3 is a list of the various reactor systems
and the blocks of numbers assxgned to the system In
the case where an instrument loop is sensmg a variable
in one lme to control a variable in another lme the
instruments in such a loop are numbered with. the line
number of the line in which the final control eiement is
located.

number in order to give the device a specific identity.

The instrument application symbols and line identifi-
cations used in MSRE drawings are in accordance with
the ORNL standard CF-57-2-1. The application symbols
are presented in Fig. 7.1.1 and the line identifications in
Fig. 7.1.2 for the convenience of those who may wish

“to interpret drawings included in this report but do not
-have immediate access to a copy of CF-57-2-1.

Figure 7.1.3 demonstrates the principles of the

_instrument numbering and identification system. Note

that,” although the level transmitter (LT-315-A) is

7 senmng ‘the ‘level in the waste tank (WT), the instrument
‘loop ‘is identified by the line number 315, because the
‘final control elément (LCV-BIS-A) is' located in line
' 315. The next loop on line 315 is composed of a

421

temperature element: (TE), a temperature switch (TS),
and a temperature alarm (TA), which are numbered
315-B as the second loop on line 315. The radiation
sensor and alarm system affiliated with the waste tank

is identified by the symbol WT, because the loop is
connected and concerned only with the waste tank. It
will be noted .that on the level control loop there are
two LS and two LA components to which an additional
arabic number has been added for means of establishing
a specific identity for these components.

The notation XA-4029-4 near TA-315-B designates
the annunciator operated by the alarm channel and
serves as a cross reference between annunciator and
instrument coding systems. The *“Hi” notation indicates
the direction in which the alarm occurs. In the case of
TA-315-B, an alarm will occur when the temperature
exceeds a point corresponding to the setting of switch
TS-315-B.

All instruments . shown on the MSRE mstrument
applications diagrams are listed in the instrument

application tabulation, which identifies the instrument
type, the service in which it is used, the physical
location in the MSRE complex, and the specification
sheet for the instrument. References to these doc-
uments are given in Chap. 5.

three types of wiring drawings. These are: (1) ele-
mentary (or schematic) diagrams, (2) panelboard and
terminal box diagrams, and (3) interconnection dia-
grams. All circuits are documented on the elementary
diagrams, which show, by means of graphic symbols
and identification codes, the electrical connections and
functions of the different circuit arrangements. They
facilitate the tracing of circuits and their functions
without regard to the actual physical size, shape, or
location of the various elements and conductors. The
panelboard and interconnection wiring diagrams show

only the physical layout of circuit elements and

conductors in particular parts of the complete system
shown in the elementary diagrams. Figures 7.2.1, 7.2.2,
7.2.3, and 7.2.4 are typical examples taken from
drawings of the MSRE system. These examples were
revised and simplified for the purpose of this illustra-
tion, and the actual MSRE drawings should be used to
obtain accurate information. Other information that
complements and is correlated with that on the above
diagrams includes the conduit and wireway layout
drawings, the process instrument switch tabulation,’
and the manual switch tabulation.?

7.2.2 Diagrams and Tabulations

There are two types of elementary diagrams: the
engineering elementary, shown in Fig. 7.2.1, and the
maintenance elementary, shown in Fig. 7.2.2. The two
are similar in appearance, because the same circuits
appear in a functional arrangement on both types, but a
close look will reveal many differences, and the
information conveyed by each is distinctly different.

- The engineering elementary is a functional diagram,

which describes how the circuit elements operate to

~ initiate or inhibit control actions in the reactor system.

Means for quickly locating relay coils and contacts,
operating set points for process-actuated switches,
switch developments for manually operated selector
switches, and notes describing the operational modes of
various elements such as solenoid valves, motors,
clutches, and brakes are all a part of the engineering
elementary diagram. It is devoid of such information as
detailed conductor coding, terminal and separable
connector tie points, and some circuit elements, such as
arc suppression diodes and jumper board lamps, that do
not contribute to an understanding of a circuit func-
tion. All of this latter information is found on the
maintenance elementary type of diagram, which is
useful for design and check-out purposes and for
locating faults or making revisions to the system after it
is installed. ‘ | l

Both types of elementary drawings were made for all
circuits in the MSRE except the following, which are
shown on maintenance elementary diagrams only: (1)
indicator lamps, (2) electronic Consotrol instruments
(ECI), (3) instrument and control circuit power distri-
bution, and (4) nuclear instruments. The indicator lamp
circuits are simple, and the maintenance elementary
serves the purpose of both types of diagrams. There are
no engineering elementary diagrams for the ECI and
nuclear instrument modules because they function
independently as complete units and only their inputs
andfor outputs have functional significance in the
electrical control circuits. These inputs and outputs are
identified in the control circuits by a relay or process
instrument switch contact designation. The modules,
however, are located in several areas and must be
interconnected, and the maintenance elementary dia-
gram provides a schematic record of the interconnecting
wiring, wire tie points, and separable connectors.
Engineering elementary diagrams of the circuits in the
nuclear instrument modules are discussed in Part I1IA of
this report,® and those for the ECI modules are
discussed in Sect. 5.2. The instrument and control
circuit power maintenance elementary diagrams (Fig.
 

 

 

 

7.2.3) are necessary to show the order in which

individual control circuits are connected to the various
ring-type power buses and the distribution panels
feeding the buses. The bus from which each circuit
receives power is identified by number (Fig. 7.2.5) on
the control elementary diagrams (Fig. 7.2.1 and 7.2.2),
but the sequence of connections is not. The instrument
power distribution single-line diagram (see Fig. 4.13.3)
should be consulted for functional information about
the instrument and control circuit power system.

Examples of instrument panelboard and field-
mounted terminal box wiring diagrams are shown in
Fig. 7.2.4. They show the physical layout of wiring
between components and terminals mounted in the
same panel or between field-mounted components and
terminals in a box nearby. Signal cables interconnecting
measuring instrument components in a particular panel
with those located elsewhere are also shown on the
panelboard wiring diagrams.

Figure 7.2.4 is also typical of the interconnection
wiring diagrams that describe the physical layout and
routing of wires in interconnecting the panelboards,
terminal boxes, and other field-mounted equipment.
Individual wires having the same origin and destination
are bundled together after leaving the terminal strips.
These bundles and the wireways through which they are
routed are identified by a cable and wireway coding
system discussed in paragraph 7.2.3.3 (Fig. 7.2.6).
Interconnection diagrams are useful primarily for con-
struction purposes, and there is a separate set of
diagrams for each functional - group of  circuits as
follows: (1) safety, (2) control, (3) annunciator, (4)
indicator lamps, (5) ECI signals, (6) instrument and
control' power, -and (7) nuclear instruments. This
arrangement expedited the design and construction
schedules by permitting the design of control circuits,
the shop fabrication of instrument panels, the installa-
tion of wiring for field-mounted components, and the
installation .of interconnecting wiring to proceed in-
dependently and simultaneously.

Additional information about the operatmg character-
istics of many devices shown on the above diagrams can
be found on the instrument application tabulation,?
manual switch tabulation,®2 and process  instrument
switch tabulation.! The. instrument application- tabu-
lation® is discussed in Sect. 7.1. The manual switch
tabulation® - is a complete list of manual switches

providing information about switch type, function, and -

location. The -process instrument switch tabulation’

lists all process-actuated switches and contains pertinent -

information on operational characteristics, switch de-
scriptions, actuation set points, and references.

7.2.3 Coding

While a brief description of major features is
presented here, the electrical control circuit numbering
and device identification scheme is in accord with
ORNL electrical design standards,® which should be
consulted for a complete explanation of the coding
system.

7.2.3.1 Circuit identification. A circuit is defined as a
network providing one or more closed paths through
which current flows between bus bars to actuate some
device or group of devices such as relay coils, indicator
lamps, or solenoid valves. Circuits are coded numeri-
cally starting with the number 1 and proceeding in
order from left to right as shown on the elementary
diagrams in Figs. 7.2.1 and 7.2.2. The numbers are
placed above the circuit in question. In general, each
circuit is involved with some specific operation which
results from the energizing of the devices in the circuit.
Circuits that are common to a functional system are
assigned consecutive numbers where possible. Table
7.2.1 is a list of the functional groups and circuit
number assignments in the MSRE.

7.2.3.2 Circuit element identification. Circuit ele-
ments are devices such as relay and solenoid valve coils,
lamps, and motors which are operated by the flow of
electrical current and contacts which complete or
interrupt the current flow in control circuits, all for the
purpose of executing control functions. These elements
are distinguished from terminal blocks and separable
connectors, which are classified as conductors.

In general, individual devices such as relays, manual
switches, and indicator lamps are identified by a coding
system consisting of a letter followed by a number. The
letters K, S, and I are used to identify the above
devices. The number associated with a relay or an
indicator lamp is the same as the number of the circuit
in which the relay is connected. For example, referring
to Figs. 7.2.1 and 7.2.2, the complete designation is
K70, K71, 170, and I71. If two or more relays are
‘connected in parallel in the same circuit, a second letter
is added following the letter K. For example, in circuit
70, the relay numbers would be KA70 and KB70 for
two relays connected in parallel, and IA70, IB70, and
so on for more than one indicator lamp. Contactor coils
are represented by the same symbol as relays but are
identified by the letters CC rather than the letter K.
Contactors are devices for repeatedly establishing and
interrupting an electric power circuit. The numbers
associated with manual switches are assigned arbitrarily
and in sequence beginning with the number 1. For
example, the complete designation for the manual
switches in circuits 70 and 71 is $103 and S104. These
numbers are in no way related to the circuit numbers
70 and 71. Some manual switches, such as HS557C in
circuit 72, and some indicator lamps are identified by a
different numbering system. These elements are closely
associated with the instrument control loops shown on
the instrument application diagrams and are identified
according to ORNL standard CF-57-2-1, a coding
system described in Sect. 7.1. Reactor process instru-
ment switches, such as RSS-557 shown in circuit 70, are
also identified according to ORNL standard CF-57-2-1.
Examples of symbols commonly used to represent
circuit devices are shown in Fig. 7.2.7.

Instruments and control circuits receive their electrl-
cal power supply through seven distribution panel-
boards. These are called instrument power panels and
are identified by the following letter and number
combination: IPP1, IPP2, , IPP7. One of these
panels is shown on the diagram in Fig. 7.2.3.

Contacts are the parts of any device which coact to
complete or interrupt an electrical circuit. Individual
contacts on relays, switches, and other devices, except
for those numbered according to the system described

426

in ORNL standard CF-57-2-1, are identified by the
addition of a letter to the device code. For example, the
relay K70 has contacts K70A, K70B, K70C, K70D, and
K70E, and so on in alphabetical order if more contacts
are added. The numbers below the relay coil symbol on
the engineering elementary diagram of Fig. 7.2.1 are the
numbers of the circuits in which the contacts are
connected. Underlined numbers represent normally

- closed contacts. All relay contacts are shown in the

aspect assumed when the operating coil is deenergized.
Contacts open under this condition are defined as
normally open, while those which are closed are defined
as normally closed. Note also that switches S103 and
S$104 in circuits 70 and 71 have contacts S103A and
S103B. . Except for push-button-type switches, all
switch contacts are shown open, and their operating
sequence is described by switch development details on
the engineering elementary diagram for each switch.
The development shown in Fig. 7.2.1 indicates that
switch S2 has four contacts, S2A, $2B, S2C, and S2D,
two of which are spares. Push-button switch contacts
are shown in the aspect assumed when no force is
applied.

Contacts on process instrument switches designated
according to ORNL standard CF-57-2-1 are identified
by the addition of a numeral after the last letter in the
device number. For example, radiation safety switch
RSS-557A has contact RSS-557A1 located in circuit
72. Additional contacts, if used, would bear the
numbers RSS-557A2, RSS-557A3, and so on in numeri-
cal order. The double -S in the code number indicates
that the switch is a safety-grade device. A single -S in
the code number indicates that it is only a control-grade
device. A short note adjacent to switch contacts
operated by process variables such as flow, level,
pressure, and radiation explains the relation between
the variables and the contact positions. .

7.2.3.3 Conductor identification. A conducting path
is the wiring which ties two or more circuit elements
together for the purpose of passing an electric current
between them or for maintaining one side of these
elements at a common potential with respect to some
other point in the circuit. A path may have several parts
or branches, but they always form a continuous
metallic conductor between elements. Each path is a
part of some circuit and is identified by a number
followed by an upper-case letter. The number is the

- same as the number identifying the circuit of which the

conducting path is a part, and the letters are assigned in

- alphabetical order to distinguish individual conducting

paths in the circuit. If necessary, each branch of a
conducting path — that is, individual wires connected
 

 

 

 

between terminal points — is identified by another
number following the upper-case letter. For example, in
Fig. 7.2.2, the conducting paths in circuit 70 are

designated 70A and 70B. If individual wires connected

between terminals (X’s) in conducting path 70A are
identified, they would be designated 70A1, 70A2,
70A3, and so on in numerical order. In -the MSRE,
individual branches are identified only in those cases
where confusion exists because several conductors
having identical wire numbers and the same area origin
and destination are routed through the same bundle.
Another coding system is used to identify the
conducting paths of power supply buses. Every branch
of the conducting path is identified by a code derived
from the instrument power distribution panel number,
the circuit breaker number, and the polarity of the
particular bus, plus a numeral. The coding system is
described by the typical example shown in Fig. 7.2.5.
The first four characters are common to all branches of
any one conducting path or ring bus (see Fig. 7.2.3),
and only the final character is changed to identify
individual branches. Since conductor coding is not
essential to understand a circuit’s functional purpose, it
is not shown on engineering elementary diagrams.
To simplify the design and construction of panel-
board wiring and the tracing of conductors for mainte-
nance purposes, additional coding information is pro-
vided on the instrument panelboards and terminal box
wiring diagrams. The conductors between panel- and
field-mounted components and the terminal strips are
identified by a letter-number combination at the
component end of each conductor. This is illustrated on

‘the wiring diagram in Fig. 7.2.4. The letter-number

combination identifies the terminal point to whlch the

opposite end of the wire is connected.

Wire markers with conductor identification numbers
are attached to each of the interconnection wires where
they. connect to terminal points. The proper identifi-
cation number for each conductor is shown on the
interconnection wiring diagram, which is also illustrated

in Fig. 7.2.4. Wire bundles or cables are identified by a
number-letter combination based on their origins and
destinations. A typical example of this is explained in
Fig. 7.2.6. Conductors are color coded as shown in
Table 7.2.2.

7.2.4 Wiring Practices

Where applicable to the MSRE electrical control
system, the wiring methods, the fabrication and instal-
lation of conduits, wireways, and other enclosures, and
the applications of commercially available wiring de-
vices comply with the provisions of the National
Electric Code.®

As a rule, control circuit elements mounted in
panelboards, such as relays, instrument contacts, push -
buttons, and annunciators, are wired to terminal strips
located on the interior sides of the panels. Field-
mounted circuit elements, such as valve position
switches, solenoid valves, and process-actuated switches,
are wired to terminal strips in conveniently located
terminal boxes. The terminal strips are connected
together as required by interconnecting wires running
through wireways which extend from points under-
neath the main and auxiliary control areas to remote
panels and field-mounted terminal boxes. Except for
the nuclear instrument panels, all wires leave the panels
at the bottom through holes in the floor. Conduits
extend southward from the top of the nuclear instru-
ment panels to the nuclear instrument penetration just
outside the auxiliary control room.

There are two wireway systems. One contains safety-
grade wires and instrument signal cables, and the other
contains control-grade wires. The safety-grade system
consists of three separate sets of rigid conduits.
Although the three sets run parallel to one another,
they are separated physically, and conductors in one set
never come into contact with those of any other set,
safety or control grade. Field-mounted components in
different safety channels are connected to separate

. terminal boxes. A similar conduit system encloses signal

cables corinecting safety-grade instrument components.
The control-grade wireways consist of three separate
sets of 3-in. by 24-in. open trays. Thermocouples, signal
cables, and control circuit wiring are run in separate
trays. Conductors from isolated equnpment are run in
conduit to the nearest tray. - -

All electrical conductors ongmatmg within the con-
tained areas are brought out through specially designed

leak-tight penetrations in the wall of the containment

vessel. The conductors are then terminated in junction
boxes located in a tunnel adjacent to the reactor.

 
 

 

 

Standard control cable and thermocouple lead wire is
run in open trays from the tunnel to the main and
auxiliary control areas.” All thermocouple extension
wires, from both thermocouples and readout instru-
ments, are brought to a patch panel in the auxiliary
control room.

In the instrument panelboards, safety- and control-
grade wires are run in separate bundles. Safety-grade
wire bundles are separated physically from each other
and from control-grade wire bundles. These are identi-
fied on the panelboard wiring diagrams by the letter S
for safety grade and the letter C for control grade. This
separation of conductors is also maintained as far as
possible in the safety and control relay cabinets, but
some mixing is unavoidable where contact matrices are
interconnected. The construction and wiring of the
relay cabinets are described in Sect. 4.11.

In general, all wires from field- and panel-mounted
interlock switches are brought to terminals in the relay
cabinets instead of being connected point to point, and
most of the interconnection wiring is done between
terminals in the relay cabinets. However, a few inter-
locks of lesser importance were connected point to
point in the field. Also, the circuits associated with
subsystems such as the samplers, fuel processing system,
and cover gas system are separately interconnected in
field panels and junction boxes, and only those wires
required for interconnection with the main reactor are
brought back to points in the main and auxiliary
control areas.

Although the use of the central interconnection
method results in a higher apparent installation cost,
the resultant reduction in design effort and installation
supervision, together with the simplification of system
checkout and operational trouble-shooting and the
flexibility for future revisions, justifies the use of this
method and probably results in lower overall costs.

7.3 PNEUMATIC SYSTEMS INSTALLATION
PRACTICES AND CODING

Three types of drawings were generated for use in the

maintenance and construction of the MSRE pneumatic
instrument systems. These are (1) pneumatic schematic
diagrams, (2) panelboard piping diagrams, and (3)
interconnection piping diagrams. Typical examples of
these diagrams are shown in Figs. 7.3.1, 7.3.2, and
7.3.3. These examples are simplified for purpose of
illustration, and individual drawings will contain much
more information than is depicted by the examples.
" The pneumatic schematic diagram (Fig. 7.3.1) dupli-
cates, in some respects, information found on the
instrument applications diagrams but includes addi-
tional details such as air header connections, line
number identification, bulkhead union locations, and
miscellaneous valving. These diagrams served as a guide
and check sheet during system design and were subse-
quently issued for use in system maintenance during
operation. They also continue to be useful in planning
and documentation of system revisions.

To facilitate the construction of major assembhes
such as instrument panels, transmitter racks, solenoid
racks, etc., tubing entering or leaving such assemblies is
terminated at a panel bulkhead, and connection be-
tween external and internal tubmg is made by means of
a bulkhead-type union fitting. This system allowed the
design of panel piping to proceed independently of the
design of interconnection and field piping and also
allowed the instrument panels and racks to be fabri-
cated in central shops, set in place, and later inter-
connected: Panel piping diagrams (Fig. 7.3.2) were
furnished to facilitate shop fabrication of panels and
racks, and interconnection diagrams (Fig. 7.3.3) were
furnished to facilitiate field installation of tubing
interconnecting these assemblies with each other and
