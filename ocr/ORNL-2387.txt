FOREWORD

This quarterly progress report of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Project at ORNL
records the technical progress of the research on circulating-fuel reactors and other ANP
research at the Laboratory under its Contract W-7405-eng-26. The report is divided into
five major parts: 1. Aircraft Reactor Engineering, 2. Chemistry, 3. Metallurgy, 4. Radiation
Damage, and 5. Reactor Shielding. |

With the suspension of work on circulating-fuel reactors as of September 1957, program
emphasis will shift to research in support of the work of other organizations participating
in the national ANP effort. The major fields of the future ORNL effort will be research
studies of shielding, materials, and radiation damage and experimental investigations of

systems and components of power plants designed for the nuclear propulsion of aircraft.

ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

SUMMARY

" During preparation of the reporfs given here
of work on the Aircraft Reactor Test (ART) and
Engineering Test Unit (ETU), it was onnounced

" by the AEC that work on the ART and ETU was

to be suspended. The' necessary steps “have since
been taken ‘to place all fabrication and con-
struction work in a standby condition. The reports

- presented here have not been modified to reflect

the work stoppage. The next report in this series
will summarize the work on the ART and the

ETU and give a picture of the status of the

molten fluoride reactor program at the time it
was suspended.

PART 1. AIRCRAFT REACTOR ENGlNEERING

1.1. Reactor and Fcclllty Construction

Methods for assembly and inspection of the

ETU and the ART were studied further, and the
necessary special checking fixtures and in-
spection tools were designed and fabricated.
Component fabrication and assembly continued, and
an experimental main: fuel-to-NaK heat exchdnger

was received. ' The completion of this unit dem-

onstrated the feasibility of manufacture of the

‘heat exchanger. The two sodium-to-NaK heat.

exchangers received previously were installed in
the ETU north head. Modifications that will
facilitate installation are being incorporated in
the ART units. The NaK-to-air radiators required

for the ETU were received and installed, and
production’ of the ART. radiators is “under way.
Rings of. brazing mater:ol to be used in the
'_fabrlcatlon ‘of these units were produced at ORNL o
ot arate of lOOOOperhour. R L

A ptessure shell lower forgmg was recewed _";.’ i
and: the - ‘upper pressure’ shell forgmg is nearly',fi
“complete.. -The design of the pressure’ shell lmer—f :
 was completed, and: preparahons for forgtng and
" machining are under way. The beryllium reflecfor-: o
. moderator outer: shell is’ belng fabricated from.
a ‘machined’ weldment. ‘As d result of recent exs
- _penments, ‘the method for manufucturmg the: ‘boron- -
.shleld-contummg shells -has been" chunged from
“shear spinning to deep drawing. The core shells

for the ETU have been completed, as previously
reported, and machining operations are under way
on another set of core shell weldments.

'

/J

Assembly of the ETU north head is well under
way, and the retort for stress-relieving the assem-
blies was completed and tested. The strut load
ring assembly was essentially completed.

_All .the boron carbide tiles for neutron shielding
are on hand and the cons and lids for the tiles
are being fabricated. Work is proceeding satis-
factorily on the production of the required stain-
less-steel-clad copper-B,C cermets. Design work

_is proceeding on the shielding external to the
- pressure shell,

Fabrication .and procurement of auxiliary equip-
ment are well under way. Layouts of the equipment
to be installed in the ETU cell are about 75%
complete. Installation work on the ETU facility
is progressing as scheduled, and many of the
major components are now available for instal-
lation.

Design work continued on components outside
the cell of the ART facility. Models were con-
structed of the special equipment room, radiator
pit, ~and radiator penthouse area to assist in
detail design and to demonstrate equipment,

_assembly, ond changeout procedures. All lump

sum contract work on the facility has been com-
pleted.

Developmental work on methods and equipment
for ART disassembly was continued. A full-scale
experiment and demonstration of an optical method

for taking measurements through hot cell windows

is being prepared. Additiona! cutting tools were

.. tested, and a list of tools and fixtures that will

be required for removul of the ART from the cell

o was. prepured

The reactor fuel pump rotary element that was
aitered for irradiation testing was installed in
a gamma-irradiation facility in the MTR canal.
The test is under way with the rotary element
operating ot a speed of 2700 rpm. The average
dose rate is 106 rep/h.

Additional tests of the twin fuel pumps installed
in the aluminum north head have demonstrated
satisfactory degassing characteristics over a
wide range of operating conditions. Installation
of the twin sodium pump loop in the aluminum
north head was completed and tests were initiated.
Preliminary data indicated satisfactory performance.

Additional performance data were obtained for
a fuel pump operating at high temperatures with
the fuel mixture NaF-ZrF ,-UF, (50-46-4 mole %,
fuel 30) as the circulated fluid. Curves showing
the minimum surge tank gas pressure and minimum
suction vs flow for cavitation-free operation were
plotted. In priming tests it was found that the
pump primed and gave full head and flow per-
formance when the liquid level was above the
floor of the expansion tank.

Examination of o primary NaK pump that was
stopped when the NaK level in the pump tank
rose and flooded the oil catch basin revealed
that grease formed by the interaction of NaK
and oil had clogged the seal loading springs
and inhibited their operation. Further development
work on the seal region of this pump is planned.

As a result of experience with NaK pump hot
test loops, modifications of the cold traps were
made. A nozzle was devised to admit a controlled
water-air mixture to the cooling coil and thus
effect a gradual transfer of the cooling load
from air to water. Tests of auxiliory NeK pumps
were initiated.

A semicircular heat exchanger designed to
simulate the tube stresses in the ART main
heat exchanger is being installed for testing,
as is a 25-tube hect exchanger that is to be
tested with the fuel mixture NaoF-ZrF, -UF,
(56-39-5 mole %, fuel 70). A test of a 100-tube
heat exchanger was terminated because of a
failure of the furnace inlet line. This heat ex-
changer had experienced 168 thermal cycles in
421 hr of high-temperature operation, ond there
were no evidences of failure. A first-approximation
thermal-stress calculation had predicted a life
of 35 to 45 cycles for this heat exchanger.

examined. Despite immediate shutdown to limit
damage by fire, the damage was sufficient to
destroy evidence that might have indicated the
nature of the failure.

The excellent performance of the cold traps
in heat exchanger and radiator test systems has

led to the elimination of plug indicators from

the ART and ETU NaK systems.

Further tests of the fuel dump valve designated
ORNL-1 indicate that the valve will be satis-
factory for the intended service at 1300°F. As
a result of further operating difficulties, the NaK
dump valve has been redesigned to minimize weld
and thermal stress distortions. .

Sodium circuit water flow tests were completed
during the quarter. In these tests the proper size
for the orifice in the control roed sodium cooling
passage circuit was determined. Also, tests were
run to establish the proper location of o flow
divider for directing sodium downward into the
reflector and upward to the island entrance region.

The second test of a one-fourth-scale outer
core shell model for determining dimensional
stability under thermal cycling conditions was
terminated after 339 cycles, that is, 39 cycles
more than scheduled. Visual inspection disclosed
no damages to the core shell, and it is currently
being measured.

Tests have demonstrated that satisfactory liquid-
metal-vapor condensers are now available for ART
and ETU use. Satisfactory zirconium fluoride
vapor traps are now also available.

A test of the ART island bellows under cyclic
strain, temperature, and pressure conditions re-
vealed that the two-convelution bellows would
be inadequate for ART service conditions. The
design has therefore been modified.

Since a failure of the fuel fill-and-drain tank
might have serious consequences, a test tank
is being built for testing under simulated service
conditions. This test is thought to be necessary
because the ART may impose stress and tem-
perature conditions greater than those for which
design properties are known with any certainty.

1.3. Instrumentation and Controls Development

A test was completed of the ART control rod
drive mechanism that simulated ART operating
conditions, except that there was no radiation
present. During the first 1129 hr of the 3000-hr

test, the rod was withdrawn and inserted 1161

times. This portion of the test was followed

by a series of periods in which the tod was fixed
at positions spaced 5 in. apart for a minimum
time of 200 hr ot each position. The remainder
of the 3000-hr test consisted of further rod cycling
in the same sequence as that used for the initial
phase of the test, The test system has been
dismantled for examination, and if results of the
examinations are satisfactory, it may be concluded
that the ART control rod and its actuating equip-
ment have met all the specifications that can
reasonably be tested without the actual nuclear
tests. '
Additional tests with helium-bubbler-type liquid-
level indicators in the fuel expansion tank of
the aluminum mockup of the ART north head
confirmed - the ‘‘dishing’’ effect on the liquid

surface in the expansion tank of changes in pump

speed. In tests in which measured amounts of
fluid were added to or removed from the expansion
tank, it was found that the level-measuring device
responded accurately.

Examinations of on-off level probes that fauled
at high NaK temperatures in NaK pump bowls

showed that the units fcnled because of internal -

oxidation of the coppet wires and that such

"oxidation occurred when the copper-to-lnconel.

welds were made. The probe has therefore been
redesigned so that the copper-Inconel junction
can be brazed instead of welded. Units of the
new design are being fabricated. ' '

in which the junction is made by brazing rather
than by welding is being investigated.

A well type of thermocouple was designed for
temperature measurements of high-velocity high-
temperature ltiquid metals in Inconel piping. The
pressure drop created by this thermocouple was
found to be less than 2.0 psi at 1200 gpm. Drift

tests of sample units in ﬂowmg NaK have been

started.

Analyses and experimental investigations of the
effects of stress on various portions and com-
ponents of the ART system were continved. In
one test, the resistance of beryllium to fotigue

‘cracking under the temperature conditions an-

ticipated in the ART is being studied. In another
another experiment a 1{‘--sccale model of the outer

of the welded reactor shells,

"A  stress analysis of the ‘island expansion
bellows at the design condition of 300 cycles

of 90-mil axial deflection at a temperature of

1250°F revealed that the bellows would be sub-
jected to considerable plastic deformation at
the outer bend of the convolutions. . Correlation
with the strain-cycling data for Inconel indicated
that the fatigue life of the bellows would be less
than the contemplated 300 cycles. The resuits

1.5. Design Physics

Calculations were made of the shielding re-
quired for the ART fuel fill-and-drain tank. The
lead shield was designed, insofar as it was com-
pleted, so that the dose rate at any point on its
surface was less than 0.2 r/hr after 100 hr of
operation at 60 Mw, 9 days cfter shutdown. It
was found that the pipes for carrying the NaK to
heat and cool the fuel could not be allowed to
penetrate straight through the shield, ond a con-
figuration that would satisfactorily reduce the
dose rate at such penefrations was developed.
Similar studies indicated that it would be necessary
to overlap adjoining pieces of the removable top
shield of the tank.

In connection with the problem of replacing o
fuel or sodium pump, a preliminary estimate was
made of the dose rate at a point 62.5 in. above
the reactor midplane and 22.5 in. from the axis,
that is, about at the bottom of the fuel pump
motor under the same after-shutdown conditions as
those specified above. The dose rate was found,
for the present shielding geometry, to be around
800 r/hr, and the radiation was mostly - from
residual fuel in the heat exchangers viewed
through the NaK pipe penetrations in the north
head.

The rates of decay-gamma energy emission from
the ART fuel for the first 180 sec after reactor
shutdown following 500 hr of operation at 60 Mw
were calculated for six gomma-ray energy groups.
The results were used in calculations of the heat
deposition rates in the bellows and stem of the
ART fuel drain valves. A total temperature rise
of 106°F was obtained for the maximum allowable
duration of the fuel draining operation.

1.6. Materials and Components Inspection

Materials for the ART,ETU, andtest components
were inspected with the intended use as the
criterion of acceptability. Results of metallo-
graphic examinations were received which in-
dicated that pickling in phosphoric acid could
be used satisfactorily for the removal of magnetic
particles. It was also found that polishing could
reduce rejections caused by surface scratches.
Results were obtained of metallographic exami-
nations which showed that no embrittlement or
attack occurs upon exposure to the materials used
in penetrant inspections.

 

[ ™

 

Inspections of sample pieces and completed
units submitted by vendors were made, including
radiators and radiator materials from York Cerp.,
heat exchangers from Griscom-Russell and from
Black, Sivalls & Brysen, forgings and weldments
from Midwest Piping Company, tanks and bellows
expansion joints from Process Engineering Corp.,
bellows from Fulton-Sylphon Company, and Inconel
and stainless steel valves from Hoke Valve, Inc.

Procedures are being developed for the in-

_ spection of seven critical welds on the ART and

ETU that can be inspected only through sections
of beryllium. Normal radiographic techniques
cannot be used because beryllium scatters the
incident x-ray beam and causes general fogglng
of the film.

1.7. Heat Transfer Studi_es

The effect of stresses and cyclic frequency on
the strength and corrosion characteristics of
Inconel in an Nc:F-ZrF“-UF4 (50-46-4 mole %)
environment was studied in the pressurized-
system thermal-cycling apparatus. Data were
obtained for straight tubes which indicated that
the extent of corrosive attack on Inconel is
dependent on the frequency of the thermal cycling,
wnh the critical frequency in the vicinity of
é to 1 cps. The effect of prior strain was in-
vestigated in tests of bent tubes. In all cases
the attack was greater in the bends than in the
straight sections of the tube, but unexpectedly
no difference was detected between the attack
on the tension and compression sides of the
bends. As in previous tests, fine-grained tubes
showed intergranular attack and coarse-grained
tubes showed general attack. Inconclusive tests
of machined welds were run and additional tests
of inspected and approved welds are to be run.

After two runs in which the operating periods
fell short of the scheduled 100 hr because of
difficulties with liquid-level control of the high-
frequency pulse-pump thermal-cycling loop, the
loop was operated for 100 hr at 1 cps with the
fuel mixture NoF-ZrF,-UF, (56-39-5 mole %)

as the fluid medium. Outside surface temperature’

oscillations of 164°F were attained at the inlet
end of the test section. Metallurgical examination
of the test specimen has not been completed,

but standard dye stain and radiographic exami-

nations show no superficial damage.

Temperature measurements made with the nickel-
plated junction of an Inconel-nickel gunbarrel
thermocouple flush with the wall of a thick-walled
Inconel tube exposed to sinuscidal temperature
oscillations in water showed good agreement with
results of theoretical calculations. A similer
Inconel-nickel gunbarrel thermocouple that was
not attached to a tube was tested in static NaF-
ZrF -UF, (50-46-4 mole %) at 1200°F for 300 hr.
It was determined that rapid removal of the
metallic junction between the central nickel
wire and the Inconel by the flucride salt precluded
the use of this type of thermocouple for measuring
rapid surface temperature transients in a fluoride
environment.

The full-scale Plexiglas model of the ART core

was used for studies of the effect of inserts
and ramps in the core volute and of thin baffles
in the core region on the core flow. No significant
improvements in flow were noted. Velocity and
pressure-loss data were obtained in water flow
tests of the 10/44-scale model of the 21-in. ART

determining heat transfer in
flowing mercury containing a uniform volume heat
source is being constructed. Experimental dota
on mass transfer in alkali metal systems were
compared with results obtained with two theo-
retically derived expressions. It was concluded
that a more general hypothesis that combines
the mechanism of hot-zone attack with a
nucleation-deposition mechanism in the cold zone
is needed to explain the experimental results.

Preliminary results indicated a value of 0.21
Btu/lb:°F for the heat capacity of LiCl-BaCl
(32.2-67.8 wt %) and of 0.24 Btu/Ib:F for LiCl-

conductivity of NaF-ZrF -UF, (50-46-4 mole %)
by using a calorimetric dewce. The values were
considerably below the thermal conductivities pre-
viously obtained (1.0 to 1.5 Btu/hr-ft-°F) by using

The same unidentified compound was found in
both LiF-MgF,-YF; and LiF-ZnF,-YF, through
petrographic and x-ray examinations. Preliminary
indications are that the unidentified material is
an LiF-YF; compound.

2.2. Chemical Reactions in Molten Salts

The determination of the  activity coefficient
of NiF2 in the molten mixture Nc::l:--Z'rF4 (53-
47 mole %) by the study of the equilibrium
constants for the reaction

NiF,(@) + H,(g) == Ni(s) + 2HF(g)

was concluded. The investigation revealed that
NiF, in solution, under the experimental con-
ditions used, behaves in a very different manner

‘than that predicted by the free energies of

formation for solid NiF,. This result was un-
expected because good agreement had been
obtained, in a previous similar study, between
the experimental ond calculated behavior of
FeF, in the same solvent. Thermodynamic con-
siderations of the unexpectedly large activity
coefficients of NiF, in fuel mixtures indicate a
probable error in ﬁme estimated free energy of
formation of Nin.

Studies were made of the reduction of UF,
by V° at 600 and at 800°C in NaF-ZrF, (50-
50 mole %) and in NaF-LiF-KF (11.5-46.5-
42 mole %) and of the reduction of UF, by W° in
NaF-ZrF (53-47 mole %). The results showed
that V° is not stable in contact with UF, ot
either temperature in either medium. In marked
contrast to earlier experiments with NaF-LiF-KF
as the reaction medium, W° was found to be
stable with respect to UF in the reaction medium
NaF-ZrF,. '

Additional studies of the stability of chromium
fluorides in NaF-LiF-KF were made with both
CrF3 and Cer. For the tests with CrFa, chromium
metal was added.  Since the experimentally
determined values for Cr** did not give a reason-
able balance of Cr*t, Cr***, and total chromium,
it was concluded that the experimental values
were probably inaccurate.

Additional experimental studies of the reduction
of FeF, by Cr® in NaF-ZrF, (53-47 mole %) in
which higher FeF. concentrations were used
further indicate that reliable values for the Ce*-

" to-Fe _H ratio cannot be determined in this reaction
' ‘medium. A study of the reaction with RbF-ZrF4

Vet et g, b

(52-48 mole %) as the reaction medium was also
made. Large Cr**to-Fe** ratios were found,

and there was a difference between the calculated

and experimentally determined chromium -con-
centrations.  Additional experimental “work is
planned to resolve these discrepancies.

"The studies of the solubilities of the structural
metal . fluorides CrF,, FeF,, and NiF, in molten
fluoride mixtures were continued. Data are now
available. for the solubilities at 600 and 800°C
in the following mixtures: NaF-ZrF, (53-47
mole %), LiF-ZrF"4 (52-48 mole %), KF-ZrF4'
{52-48 mole %), and RI::F_-ZrF4 (52-48 mole %).

Studies of the activities of the metallic con-

stituents of the nickel-molybdenum alioys being

developed .to contain molten fluoride salts were
initiated. Preliminary experiments are under way
to determine the feasibility of measuring th
activities by an emf method. o '

Ratios of activity coefficients of NiF, to FeF,
in NaF-ZrF4 (53-47 mole %) and in KF-LiF
(50-50 mole %) were obtained in Daniell cells
ot 650°C. Similor measurements were made of
Cr-Ni couples in NaF-Z¢F, (53-47 mole %). The
values for the Ni-Fe couple were in agreement
with results obtained previously, and, if the
activity coefficient for FeF, is taken to be 3,
the activity coefficient of NiF, obtained from
these measurements is (1.8 + 0.3) x 103, based
on the solid as the stondard state. The data
obtained for the Cr-Ni couples indicated that
the container material affected the results, which
were thus inconclusive.

Various experimental difficulties involved in an
emf study of the effects of various compositions
of the solvent LiCI-ThCl, on a solute in dilute
concentration were resofved, and 'PbClz was
selected as the solute. Cooling curves were
run on various LiCl-ThCl, samples to study
the solvent composition limits at 700°C, and
important features of the phase diogram of the
system were established.

Determinations were made of the solubilities of
argon and of xenon gases in molten NaF-ZrF 4

(53-47 mole %) as functions of pressure and tem- '

perature. The data show that in this solvent the
solubilities of the gases follow Henry’s law,
they increase with increasing temperature, and
they decrease with increasing atomic weight of
the gas. Similar studies of the solubilities of
HF gas in NoF-ZrF, have shown that the gas

recovery of oxygen was obtained when 0.5 mg
of Li,O was added to a simulated sample solution.

The apparatus for the determination of oxygen
as oxides in fluoride salts and in metals by the
fluorination of the oxides with KBrF, was com-
pleted and assembled. A detailed procedure for
use of the apparatus was formulated and is
presently being tested. Zirconium oxide was
selected as a standard for calibration of the
apparatus. -

The method for the determmahon of nickel as
its chelate complex with 4-isopropyl-1,2-cyclo-
hexanedionedioxime was applied to samples ob-
tained ‘from studies of the solubility of nickel
in molten sodium. Since the samples are contained
in molybdenum buckets, some molybdenum is
also present in the sodium. In order to avoid
interference by this molybdenum it is necessary
to dissolve the sodium sample in water rather
than in methanol. ' A special apparatus, fabricated
from fluorothene, was designed in order to carry
out this dissclution safely and efficiently.

A series of tests was initiated of the possible
reaction between pump lubricants and alkali
metals in an effort to determine whether the
reaction can produce acetylene. Initial tests
showed that *‘Gulfspin-35"" and NoK in equdl
volumes reacted to produce considerable acetylene,
with an accompanying significant increase in
pressure. Approximately 2% of the alkali metal
apparently was converted to the carbide.

Additional work was done on the determination
of aluminum in mixtures of fluoride salts with
pyrocatechol viclet. A study was made of inter-
ferences that would normally be encountered in
corrosion tests with fluoride salts and the newly
developed nickel-molybdenum base alloys. Iron
and titanium interfere seriously, but nickel,
chormium, molybdenum, and niobium do not
interfere. '

Studies of the application of tri-n-octylphosphine
oxide for the solvent extraction of metals of
interest in the ANP program were continued.
The effect of sulfuric acid concentration on the
extraction of titanium with TOPO was demonstrated
in experiments in which only 6% of the titanium
was extracted from | M sulfuric acid in contrast
to 99% from 7 M sulfuric acid. Niobium was found

to be extracted gquite well by TOPO from hydro-

chloric acid solutions, relatively well from sulfuric
acid, and essentially not at all from nitric or
perchleric acids.

 

The weighing compartment of a Cahn Electro-
balance was installed in o vacuum drybox. By
means of this microbalance it is possible to weigh
trace quantities of materials. that must be pro-
tected from either atmospheric contamination or

“moisture.

PART 3. METALLURGY

3.1. Nickel-Molybdenum Alloy Developmeni
Studies

Developmental work has continued on a new
container alloy for the fuel mixture NaF-KF-LiF-
UF, (11.2-41-45.3-2.5 mole %, fuel 107) at service
temperatures up to 1800°F. Emphasis has been
placed on determining the optimum alloy com-
position, on determining whether the most promising

alloy, INOR-8 (composition range: 15-19% Mo,

6-8% Cr, 4-7% Fe, bal Ni), can be produced as
a ‘‘commercial’’ item, and on determining the
fabricability of duplex tubing of INOR-8 clad
with stainless steel for use in heat exchangers.
Since corrosion resistance, weldability, and creep
properties have not yet been completely evaluated,
two other compositions, INOR-8 modified and
INOR-9, are also being studied as alternates.
The modified INOR-8 alloy contains 2 to 4 wt %
niobium to increase creep strength, and INOR-9,
which contains no chromium but is strengthened
with niobium, should be corrosion resistant at
1800°F.

The physical properties of INOR-8 have been
determined, and means for producing sound ingots
are being investigated. Studies of oxidation have
shown that unless the alloy contains about 6 wt %
chromium the oxidation rate is not acceptable.
Tests of corrosion resistance and mechanical
properties are continuing.

Preliminary tests have shown the oxidation
resistance of INOR-9 tc be .about the some as

“that of Hastelloy B and the creep properties to

be about the same as those of INOR-8. It is
attacked by fuel 107 to a depth of 1 to 3 mils
in 1000 hr at 1500°F.

Studies of produchon heats of INOR-B have
indicated that it is a ‘“commercial’’ alloy. Upon
completion of orders which have been placed with
various vendors, sufficient material will be
available to fabricate about 30 forced-circulation
loops, one in-pile test loop, and specimens for
a rigorous program of creep and weld tests.

have been found to have satisfactory properties
in both the as-welded and the aged conditions.

Evaluation studies of the creep charucterishcs
of the nlckel-molybden_um alloys under @ constant

defects in the form of cracks and voids to a

A summary of the thermal-convection loop results
obtained thus far indicates that the maximum
attack has not exceeded 3 mils in 500 hr at
Increasing the time of the test from
500 to 1000 hr causes the attack to increase
T to 2 mils.

In order to investigate the compatibility of
molybdenum with nickel-molybdenum alloys in a
commen fluoride fuel circuit, two Hastelloy W
thermal-convection loops with molybdenum inserts
in the hot legs were operated with fuel 107.

 One loop was operated for 1000 hr ot 1500°F,
- and the second operated at 1650°F for 517 hr.

Numerous fabrication defects were found along
the surfaces of the molybdenum inserts, but there
was no evidence of attack. The Hastelloy W
surfaces exposed to the salt showed heavy
surface pits ond shallow void formation to a
depth of 3 mils in the loop operated at 1650°F
and 2 mils in the loop operated at 1500°F. The

reduce the creep strength; however, the total
elongation and rupture life after 300 cycles are
less than ofter 100 cycles.

A test program was initiated for evaluating the
strain-cycle properties of Inconel weldments in
orgon aond in fuel 30. Dota from initial tests
compare favorably with standard tubular specimen
data. _

The strain-cycle properties of hot-pressed,
reactor-grade beryllium are also being investi-
gated. Results of initial tests at 1250°F illustrate
the difference between a brittle metal and a
ductile clloy.

Results of strain-cycling tests of carburized
inconel at 1500°F indicate that carburization
does not impair the strain-cycle properties.
Relaxation tests of fine-grained Inconel at 1100°F
were completed, and the results were found to
be those expected on the basis of previous tests.

In order to obtacin information on the behavior .

of Inconel Under multiaxial conditions, ¢ biaxial
creep-test program was initiated. Data obtained
in initial tests demonstrate that the axial strain
rate is independent of the state of stress and
dependent only upon the stress in the oxial
direction in tests in which the ratio of the
axial to tangential stress is greater than Y.

Tests were run in order to determine the
relative strengths and ductilities of Inconel
weld metal and base material. Both the yield
and vultimate strengths of the weld metal are
greater than those of the parent metal at tem-
peratures from 1400 to 1800°F, whereas - the
ductility of the weld metal is lower.

Several new brazing alloys were tested for
oxidation resistance ond found to be satisfactory.
Screening tests of a series of high-nickel-content
brazing alloys for use in fabricating NaK-to-fuel

heat exchangers were completed. It was found-

that porosity of the fillets was related to the
boron content of the brazing alloy.

A study of the effect of grain size on the cor-
rosion of Inconel by fuel 30 was made with the
use of thermal-convection loops containing hot-
leg sections subjected to annealing treatments
intended to produce grains similar to those formed
during the furnace brozing of heat exchanger and
radiator tubes. Preferential grain-boundary attack
such as that found in the examination of heat

exchangers occurred to a limited extent in the
coarse-grained sections of the loop. In reviews
of previous test results indications were found
that relatively deep attack can occur. under
certain conditions of grain-boundary orientation in
coarse-grained material. ' '

3.3. Welding and Brazing Studies

An examination of an all-welded Inconel impeller
that cracked in service revealed that the fobrication
procedure provided only a limited joint length
where the vanes were welded to the top plate,
ond the joint design and lack of accessibility
permitted only very shallow weld penetration.
A modified fabrication procedure is now being
used in which the joints are brazed for additional
reinforcement and to improve reliability. |

Tests were performed which indicated that cracks
in the braze fillets of tube-to-header joints of
NaK-to-air radiators could be healed by rebrazing.
Such cracks result from transverse shrinkage and
distortion of the tube sheets during the deposition
of the longitudinal welds of the headers.

Tests were run to study welding and brazing
procedures for making the tube-to-tube sheet
joints in the heads of the ART fuel fill-and-drain
tank. In order to produce joints free of root
cracks, a low restraint, trepanned type of joint
was designed. The brazing alloy will be contained
in annular sumps machined in the tube sheet
around each tube. When the tube sheet reaches
the brazing temperature, the brazing alloy will
flow into the space between the tubes and the
tube sheet through three holes drilled from each
sump into the tube hole. A relatively low rate
of temperature rise will be used to aveid brazing
alloy liquefaction before the massive header
sheet reaches the brazing temperature.

A study was initiated to ascertain whether,
radiographic and metallographic determinations of
porosity in tube-to-header welds could be cor-
related. The limits of detection by the radio-
graphic method are being determined as an initial
step in this study.

Fabrication of a small semicirculor heat
exchanger for experimental tests was under-
taken. The initial planning and procedural
experimentation have been completed, and the
first of two heat exchangers will be completed
soon.

3.4, Corrosion and Mass Transfer Studies .

The possibility of using vanadium as a con-
stituent of a container materidl for lithium is
being investigated. After 100 hr ot 1500°F in
a seesaw furnace apparatus, a considerable
amount of mass transfer was found in the cold
zone of a vanadium capsule filled with fuel 107.
A static capsule showed only ‘slight surface
roughening of the bath zone after 100 hr at 1500°F.

Seesaw furnace tests were also conducted on
molybdenum ond niobium cups enclosed in the
hot zones of type 316 stainless steel capsules
while in contact with lithium at 1500°F. Exami-
nation of the surfaces of the refractory metals

following the tests showed no attack, and no

mass-transfer deposits of niobium- or molyb-
denum .could be detected either metallographically
or spectrographically on the sfamless steel
cold-zone walls. :

loops. Both loops tested failed because of leaks
that developed in the saddle-weld areas. Loops
with welds fabricated by a different design are
to be tested. Preliminary tests of specimens
of refractory metals suspended in the chamber
indicate - that the chamber will provide cdequate
protection for the metals and thus eliminate the
need for oxidation-resistant claddings.

Forced-circulation loops of both Hastelloy B
and Inconel were operated for 2000 hr with sodium.
The maximum sodium temperature in these tests
was. 1500°F, and a 300°F temperature drop existed
between hot- and cold-leg sections. Metal deposits
were present in the cold legs of both loops;
weight “measurements of the deposits indicated
a buildup of 21 g in the Hastelloy B loop compared
with 20 g in the Inconel loop. Comparison of
these test results with those of 1000-hr tests
under identical operating conditions indicate that
the rate of mass transfer during the second 1000-hr
period is much slower than the rate during the
first 1000-hr period.

A Hastelloy W forced-circulation loop which
circulated sodium for 1000 hr ot a maximum
temperature of 1500°F showed mass transfer
deposits that were approximately 17% greater

in .weight than the deposits observed in a

Hastelloy B loop under similar conditions. The
deposits were found by chemical analysis to

contain 97% Ni and 3% Cr.

A type 347 stainless steel forced-circulation
loop after operation with sodium at 1500°F showed

only slight traces of mass-transfer deposits.

The loop was operated for 1000 hr with a tem-
perature drop of 300°F. '

has been shown to be hot-zene controlled.

3.5. Materials Fabrication Research -_

Experimental = studies were continued of the
production of high-purity yttrium metal by the
reduction of a YF,-MgF,-LiF mixture with lithium
to yield an yttrlum-magnesmm alloy.  Slight
modifications of the procedures used during the
reduction step. improved the yield. A vacuum
heat treatment of the yttrium-magnesium alloy is
being  investigated as o means of disﬁ"ing off

the magnesium and excess lithium.

Equipment is being built with which to measure
the rate of diffusion of hydrogen through potential
cladding materials for hydride moderators. The
equipment will also be used for measuring the
rate of loss of hydrogen from clod hydrided-metal
assemblies and for monitoring hydrogen losses
during thermal cycling and hydrogen migration
tests.

A study was made of the available information
on the volatility of BeO in steam. The data
indicate that under some conditions it would
be entirely possible to corrode and transport
large quantities of BeO in steam in relatively
short times. Several hot-pressed BeO specimens
were fabricated for physical tests.

An apparatus is being designed for the de-
termination of the heat throughput required to
cause initial failure in ceramic cylinders. The
data obtained with this apparatus will be used
in evaluating the thermal-stress resistance of
ceramic materials.

Dense zirconium hydride samples were prepared
to establish procedures for hydriding ytrium
metal in the new hydriding epparatus. The
equipment is now ready for production operation.

3.6. Metallogrephic Examinations of Engineering
Test Components After Service

A metallographic examination was made of the
York Corp. ART prototype NaK-to-air test radiator
which foiled after 870 hr of testing, but no
specific cause for the failure was found. The
microstructures of the tube that failed and
adjacent tubes did not indicate stress failures,
and there was no evidence of incipient failure.

 

xXxXvili ‘%

 

York Corp. test radiator No. 16, which also
failed during testing (after 1438 hr) was so
extensively. damaged by fire that the metal-
lographic data were inconclusive. Five tubes
were found to be plugged. Chemical analyses of
two types of plug material indicated mass transfer
in the one case and fuel constituents in the
other. The presence of fuel components indicate
that there had been o leak of fuel into NaK at
the heat exchanger which was alsc being tested
in the test system.

Examination of the heat exchqnger (Process

Engineering . Corp. heat exchanger No. 3, type
SHE-7) did not reveal any open cracks, but the
fuel probably lecked through severcl tubes in
which there was complete grain-boundary pene-
tration. A metallic deposit was found on the
fuel side of o tube from the hot-header area that
was shown by spectrographic analysis to be
predominantly .nickel; the heat exchanger was
fabricated of Inconel. The fuel (No. 70) circulated
in this heat exchanger was NaF-ZrF, -UF (56-
39-5 mole %).

A similar heat exchanger (Process Engineering
Corp. No. 2), which had been removed from a
test system because of a cold trap failure after
1845 hr of testing, was also examined. This heat
exchanger had been circulating NaF-ZrF,-UF
(50-46-4 mole %, fuel 30) and NaK. Grain-boundary
voids were found that completely penetrated the
tube walls in the hot-header area. There was
some general corrosion attack on both the fuel
and the NaK sides of the tube walls, and the
usual gold-colored metal deposits were found on
the surfaces exposed to fuel in the cooled area.

An Inconel centrifugal pump that had circulated

NaK for 4400 hr at about 1200°F was examined
after it was found that lubricating oil had been
lecking into the NaK stream. Carbide precipitates
were found on all wetted parts.  The extent of
carburization was not sufficient to damage the
heavy sections, but all thin sections, such as
bellows and diaphragms, were sufficiently affected
to require replacement.
- A metallographic study was also made of the
fused-salt - corrosion resistance of saddle welds
from a large number of thermal convection loops.
No evidence of intergranular corrosion of im-
properly oriented grains was found.

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.7. Nondestructive Testing

The recent application of eddy-current methods
has involved the measurement of thin-metal
sections and of cladding layers on metallic
laminates. Also, a mothematical study is being
made of the impedance changes in a probe-coil
over a plane metal object of apparently infinite
thickness. This study will be extended to the
case of a probe-coil over a plane metallic object

of finite thickness. The results of continued

efforts, both the experimental and the theoretical
studies will be used to develop techniques of
thickness measurement with induced eddy currents.

The ultrasonic and the eddy-current inspection
of pipe, plate, and tubing for the construction of
the ETU and the ART continued. The rejection

rate for these materials was normal.

Two core shells were inspected for wall thlck--.

ness variations, for lamination-like discontinuities,
and for crack-like imperfections. No defects were
found, but one of the shells was rejected because
the section thickness was less than the specified
allowable dimension. '
Ultrasonic resonance techniques were used to

detect unbonded areas in Inconel-clad copper-

boron carbide plates. Unbonded areas greater
than the area of the ultrasonic transducer were
easily detected from either side of the laminate,
and .unbonded areas as small as 1/8 in. in diameter
were detected with reasonable reliability.  All
unbonded areas detected with resonance ultrasound
were confirmable by stripping the cladding from
the core, and, in the course of stripping the
cladding, no unbonded areas were located- that
had not been revealed by fhe mspechon. .

, PART 4. ‘ RADIATION DAMAGE
4 Radictlon Dumage

Exommuhon of ‘the radioactive - portlon ‘of in-
pile loop No. 6 has mdlcated that the maximum -
depth’ of corrosion was. 3 mils. This Inconel
forced-circulation loop was o'pérated in the MTR.

‘Three. capsules contaamng moderator materials

(graphlte in nickel, ZrH, in ‘molybdenum, and

BeO in Inconel) that had been “irradiated in the
MTR were examined, The: dimensions of the
capsules were not upprecmbly affected by the
irradiation. The BeQ siugs were removed from
the capsules, and no evidences of swelling or
cracking were found.  The cans will be removed

from the graphite and ZrH, slugs on the remote

~milling machine.

Specimens from the ARE serpentine fuel tubes
were examined. Subsurface void formation to a
depth of 3.5 mils was found on the fuel side.
The sodium side showed a slight mass transfer
deposit and some subsurface void formation.
A specimen taken from the inlet to the fuel-to-
helium heat exchanger showed subsurface voids
to a depth of 4 mils.

Out-of-pile creep tests dre under way to provide
for comparison with data obtained-in the MTR.
Difficulties with temperature control were ex-
perienced during the MTR irradiations, and the
apparatus is therefore being modified.

Leaks of undetermined origin caused three
stress-corrosion experiments in the LITR to be
discontinued, and therefore an apparatus is being
constructed that will be instrumented to check
the point of failre. Thermal stresses that
occurred during irradiation may have caused
opening of brazed joints or tubing connections.

The forced-circulation loop which was operated
in a vertical hole in the LITR for 235 hr is being
disassembled. The supposition that the pump
became inoperative because of bearing seizure
was substantioted. No significant amounts of
ZrF, vapor deposits were observed in the pump.
The loop will be examined in detail to determine
the extent of corrosion and the performance of
of the various components.

The average thermal-neutron-flux exposures of
several static corrosion capsules irradiated in
the MTR were calculated from the Co%® dis-

~_ integration rate of the Inconel container material.
'~ The values were in substontial agreement with

those calculated from fission-product yields in
the fuel contadined in the capsules. The con-

" tribution. to the Co%% disintegration rate in

irradiated Inconel arising from the nickel con-

. stituent through the Niw(n,;:v)Co‘so reaction was

investigated and found to be negligible.
Preparations  were continued for irradiation in

" the ETR of moderator materials for use in high-

temperature reactors. Fabrication of test speci-

. mens was started.

Hot-pressed boron nitride, whlch is bemg con-

 sidered for use as o neutron shielding material,

was fested and found to be undamaged by
irradiation at a temperature of 1800°F to a thermal-

neutron dosage of 1.3 x 102% neutrons/cm?.

I

SERE——

Post-irradiation examinations of two hot-pressed
boron carbide tiles are underway. Plates of BN-Ni
(10.3 wt % BN) and CaB ;-Fe (7.6 wt % CGB‘)
cermets clad with type 304 stainless steel were
irradiated in the LITR. There were no structural
changes as a result of irradiation to an average
B burnup of 19%, but both . materials were
damaged by irradiation to an average burnup
of 38%. Stainless-steel-clad B JC-copper cermets
were also irradiated. Damage to these samples
was found to be related to burnup, temperature
of irradiation, and the thermal-cycling history.

The general results that have been obtained
in the investigations of the effects of nuclear
radiation on semiconductor devices indicate that
the barrier phenomenon should be studied under
- closely controlled conditions, and the equipment
for such a study is being developed. Experimental
results obtained from gamma irradiation of grease
coated and uncoated point-contact germanium
diodes were analyzed, and curves describing the
behavior were prepared. A preliminary experiment
was performed with transistors to determine the
actual amount of radiation domage introduced
into a sample by bombarding the sample at liquid
nitrogen tempercture. The damage observed was
somewhat different than that of samples bombarded
at room temperature, but refinements must be
made in experimental techniques before con-
clusive results can be obtained.

as well as for self-absorption and self-shielding
of the detectors.

The first test in a series of tests for investi-
gating the shielding properties of Hevimet,
stainfess steel, and lithium hydride preceded
by a beryllium reflector-moderator and backed
by borated water has been completed. The
thermal-neutron flux measurements beyond the

5.2. Bulk Shielding Facility

In the continuing study of methods of reducing
capture - gamma-ray production in shields, the

effectiveness of distributing lithium throughout
a lead shield was investigated.

It was found
that the lithiated lead was approximately. as
effective as boral-covered lead.

5.3, Tower Shielding Reactor-ll

Nuclear calculations and development experi-
ments have been continued in order to fix the
design of the Tower Shielding Reactor-11 (TSR-I).
An additional feature in the mechanical design
is being investigated which will allow a beam
of radiation through the shield of the reactor -
to sweep both a vertical and a horizental plane.
On the basis of the design now anticipated,
calculations have been performed for predicting
the gamma-ray heating of the TSR-Il shield.

5.4. Shield Design

A Monte Carlo calculation of the energy spectrum
and angular distribution of normally incident
0.662-Mev gamma rays which are transmitted
through 3-, 6-, and 9-in.-thick cluminum slabs
has been performed on the Oracle. Plots of
the transmitted collided energy fraction have
been fitted with analytical expressions.

A total of 512 problems has now been computed
in the Monte Carlo calculation of the gamma-ray
Typical
results of the heating of pure lead slabs 4 mean
free paths thick are given for 3-Mev gamma rays
incident on the slabs at .angles of 0, 60, 70.5,
and 75.5 deg.

In the Monte Carlo calculations for lead and
water shields, dose-rate buildup factors were
also calculated for normally incident gamma
rays on all-lead slabs and on all-water slabs,
as well as on composite slabs of the two materials
having varying percentages of lead content and
totdl composite slab thicknesses of up to § mean
free paths. The values of the buildup factors
determined for the pure matericls in these cal-
culations have been compared with the values
obtained for infinitely thick slabs with the NDA
moments method.  Those determined for the
composite slabs have been compared with values
obtained by the use of formulas in which the
buildup factors independently computed for lead
and water are combined to determine the value
for a composite slab.

Weld Tests

Weld shrinkage and distortion tests, as previously
described,’ have continued, with approximately
50 tests having been completed. Shrinkage tests
were completed on the equatorial weld joints in
the two /-m.-thlck core shells that form the
reactor fuel annulus, and a nominal value of 0.060
in. was established for transverse shrinkage. The
weld tests were also completed for the redesigned

pressure shell equatorial joint, and a nominal value
of 0.200 in. was established as the allowance for
transverse shrinkage. Work in progress during one
of the pressure shell weld tests is shown in
Fig. 1.1.1. | '

Additional tests are under way to determine the
weld shrinkage ond acceptability of the joint de-
signs of the equatorial welds on the '4 -in.-thick
outer reflector shell, the /16-|n.—th|ck shielding
cover shells, and the é-m.-tl-nck pressure shell
liner. It was found that improved results could be
obtained in making the equatorial butt weld for the
pressure shell liner by reducing the metal thick-
ness at the land so that the root pass could be put
in with a lower welding current. Improved results
were obtained on the other special closure welds

Equipment Inspection

-Main Fuel-to-NaK Heat Exchanger Checkmg
Fixture. — A special checking fixture was designed
and fabricated to be used to dimensionally check
the main heat exchanger tube bundles and to thus
establish whether they can be assembled into the
reactor. The fixture is shown in Fig. 1.1.2, with

for Checking.

a wooden model of a tube bundle positioned for
checking. The spherical section of the fixture
establishes the outer surface of the reflector
assembly, and the pins located in this spherical
section define the area into which the tube bundle
channel must fit. The dummy header blocks at the

top and bottom define the parting planes between
the headers, and the notched rings at top and
bottom establish the nozzle positions.

Two heat exchanger checking fixtures of this
type, which were fabricated by the Bunell Machine
& Tool Company, were available in June; one was
delivered to ORNL and the other was delivered to
the heat exchanger fabricator, Black, Sivalls &
Bryson. Since then it has been necessary to return
the units to the Bunell Machine & Tool Company
for reworking, because the header end plates have
been redesigned to give more cleurance between
the headers.

Reactor Component Inspectlon. ~ Special tools
were designed and built to dimensionally check
the B,C tiles required for neutron shielding. An
lnspechon gage designed for checking the chord
fength of the various pieces is shown in Fig.
1.1.3, and a device used for inspecting the top

~and bottom edges of the tiles, which were machined

as conical surfaces, is shown in Fig. 1.1.4,

COMPONENT FABRICATION AND ASSEMBLY
Main Fuel-to-NaK Heat Exchanger
J. Zasler R. B. Clarke

An experimental unit of the main fuel-to-NaK
heat exchanger was completed at Black, Sivalls &
Bryson and shipped to Oak Ridge. The manufacture .
of this unit, which is shown in Figs. 1.1.5, 1.1.6,
and 1.1.7, has proved all the major fabrication
methods and established the feasibility of monu-

facture of the heat exchanger. This experimental

unit was completed prior.to the assembly of a

prototype unit through the use of partially- mSpected
material and some imperfect parts.

The seventh channel  preduced was: machmed'

successfully to within dimensional tolerances and
is ready for assembly into the prototype unit. A

modification was made to the fool-octuafmg mecha- -

nism on the large boring mill used for channel
machining to allow the tool to rock as the channel
moves past it. The tool thus operates at a constant
angle as it is moved vertically. All parts have

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 1957

been completed for the prototype unit, and assembly
can be started. A change in the method of fabri-
cating the header assemblies has been adopted
which eliminates several operations. As a result
of the experience gained in the brazing of the
experimental unit and in additional test work, it
has been decided that it is no longer necessary
to hand-clean the oxide from the tubes after they
are hot-formed in the resistance-heating fixture.

Sodium-to-NaK He_gt' Exchungers
W. S. Harris

The first and second sodium-to-NaK heat ex-
changers, which were delivered during the previous
quarter, were successfully installed in the ETU
north head. It was determined that meodifications
could be made that would facilitate the installation
of subsequent heat exchangers, and the modifi-

-cations are being incorporated in units 4 and 5.

During the fabrication .of unit 3 it was determined
that a dented fube could be cut out and replaced
successfully.

ART-ETU Radiators
M. M. Yarosh

Both of the radiators required for installation in
the ETU facility were received in Oak Ridge during
the quarter. The first unit, received during the
week of July 22, was inspected and then installed
in the facility. The second unit was received the
week of September 2, and inspection was started.

As had been somewhat anticipated, fabrication
difficulties were encountered in the production of

- these early units. "It was found possible to intro-

duce corrective measures both to bring the units

. up to an acceptable standard for their intended use
and to ellminafe the. dlfﬁcultles from later pro-
_ductlon. o

" Distortion of the ﬁrst umf during assembly

“welding resulted in cracks in the back-braze alloy
 of 69 of the tube-to-header joints. The unit was

repaired by placement of additicnal alloy ot the
back-braze joints and putting the unit through a
second brazing cycle.  All cracks were filled by
the ddditional brazing operation.

~ During the fabrication of the second unit three
tubes were damaged as a result of distortion of
the unit during assembly. An assembly sequence
was worked out to eliminate such troubles in future

ployed on the first ART radiator assembly and
appears to be working successfully. 7

It was decided that the brazing operation could

be improved if the vendor was supplied with the
type of brazing rings previously produced at Oak
Ridge in pilot quantities. A facility for producing -

brazing rings was therefore set up at ORNL, and
ring production of approximately 10,000 per hour
was achieved. Through the week of September 6,
a total of approximately 750,000 rings was pro-
duced.

fabricated. The part is scheduled to be compleied
by April 1958.

It has been decnded to fobricate the dormers in
the upper pressure shell as separate components

. and weld them intc the shell. This work is to be

done in the Y-12 shops. . It is anticipated that the
first pressure shell upper forging will have been

period.

The lower pressure shell liner half is to be
forged and machined by the Ladish Ce. This work
is currently in the design end tooling fabrication
stage. The first shell half is scheduled to be

_struck in October 1957.

The upper pressure shell liner is to be fabri-
cated from a cold-formed weldment and will be
welded to the north head assembly before final
machining so that accurate dimensional control
can be maintained. This first weldment has been

fabricated by the Steel & Alloy Tank Co. and has

been received.
Beryllivm Reflector-Moderator Outer Shell

A shell Il upper weldment has been received
-and will be welded to the strut load ring assembly

before machining so that weld shrinkage and dis-

moy be oecurofely positioned in the assembly.

Boron Shield Contemers - Shells IV ond V

G W. Peach
The ‘method for manufacturing shells IV and V,

" the boron shield - containers, has been changed
from shear spinning (Hydrospin). to deep drawing.
. Experimental draws have been made on steel and
‘Inconel “sheet by forming 35-in. hemispheres in

order to evaluate the forming problems. These
tests substantiated the practicability of the method.

Tool engineering is now under way for the manu-
facture of shells IV and V by this method.

The application of the deep-draw process to
these pieces is an unusual one because of the
large ratio of part diameter to thickness. Con-
ventional drawing practice'_indicdies a maximum
diameter-to-thickness ratio of 100/1.  The parts
in question are 0.085 in. thick and 45 and 50 in.
in diameter, and thus the diameter-to-thickness
ratios are 500/1 and 600/1, respectively.  This
involves a considerable extension of conventional
limits. The principal difficulties encountered in
the early stages of the test program were buckling
in the equatorial region of the hemispheres because
of insufficient blank hold-down pressure and rupture
at the center of the blank from excessive tensile
stress on the blank. . '

 

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 1957

Equipment used for the experimental drawing
operations at Kaiser Metal Products, Inc., is
shown in Fig. 1.1.11, in which may be seen the

‘punch, the draw die, and the hold-down ring of the

2200-ton hydraulic press. A typical rupture defect
on a 0.074-in.-thick, 35-in.-dia steel shell caused
by excessive punch pressure is shown in Fig.
1.1.12. A typical pucker defect in a 0.062-in.-
thick, 35-in.-dia Inconel shell is shown in Fig.

ferent methods are illustrated in Fig. 1.1.14. The
specimen at the rear of Fig. 1.1.14 is 0.074-in.-

without backing material. As may be seen, the
material puckered. The middle specimen of 0.074-

(Conftdanriotwithtopten)

The experimental work showed that by reinforcing
the blank with backup steel sheets, the desired
hold-dewn pressures to avoid puckering could be
maintained without rupturing the blank. The best
results were obtained on 35-in.-dia hemispheres
with 0.062-in.-thick welded Inconel blanks re-
inforced with ‘r’/sz-in.-fhick hot-rolled steel sheet.
There were indications that good results could
be obtained wnth less remforcmg but ‘that this
would require ‘‘cut-and-try’’ balancing of hold-
down and press-punch pressures.

The decision to discard the shear spinning tech-
niques for manufacturing shells IV and V was
based on the following:

1. Try-out work demonstrated that adherence to
the spinning mandrel would be very difficult and

- perhaps impossible to maintain.

2. In order to even approach adequate dimensional
control it would be necessary to preform and pre-
machine the blanks.

3. An extensive amount of development work
would still be necessary to establish the most
satisfactory shape for the spinning rolls.

 
4. Intermediate annealing steps’''might distort
the parts and make them d|ff|cult to reullgn on the
machine. '

5. Inconel stock requirements appedred to be
higher than originally anticipated and it was un-
certain that material costs could be held within
reasonable limits.

While it is felt that fhe spmmng process has
very definite advantages in ultimate quality of
reactor parts, much basic knowledge of the forming
process needs to be developed to overcome the
difficulties experienced with ART parts.

Inner and Outer Core Shells
G. D. Whitman G. W. Peach

As previously reported the inner core shell and
island assembly for the ETU has been completed.
Four more inner core shell weldment halves have
been received, and two of these weldments are
shown in Fig. 1.1.15. Upper and lower halves of
an outer core shell weldment have also been
received, and machining operations have been

 

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 1957

started.” The lower-half weldment prior to machining
is shown in Fig. 1.1.16. Machining operations are
50% complete on the lower half of the outer core
shell and 15% complete on the upper half of this
shell. These parts are stress relieved after the
rough machining operation so that distortion in the
final machining operation is minimized. The shear
spinning process for the production of these and
other shells was cbandoned because of the dif-
ficulties described previously and because satis-
factory forging, welding, and machmmg techniques
have now been developed.

Reactor North Head
C. K. McGlothlan

The two sedium-to-NaK heat exchangers received
from the Griscom-Russell Co. have been fitted into
the ETU notth head, and welding operations have
been started. The heat exchangers are shown in
place in the lower deck weldment in Fig. 1.1.17.
In Fig. 1.1.18, one deck plate may be seen in
position for welding.

mated 80,000 in.2 will be required for the entire
job which includes a small amount of 0.250- and
0.312-in.-thick material ot a cost proportional to
the increased thickness. The ERCO Division of
American Cor & Foundry Co. is fabricating the
required cermet shapes from the rolled cermet
sheet material. Tooling for this job is 95% com-
plete. Seventy fabricated pieces have been re-
ceived and accepted. The 1050 pieces required

satisfactorily on this job. The controlling factor
in the completion of this order is the rate of

The electrical discharge method has been the
only practical way found to trim the cermet parts
accurately, and the work has been scheduled on
a multishift basis to expedite delivery of the parts.

arrangement, a nut and bolt located between the
pressure shell and the filler plates were to be

used, but, if the nut and bolt were to become in-.

operative during assembly, it would be necessary
to grind out the pressure shell equatorial weldment
and replace the threaded parts of the support struc-
ture. The redesign eliminates the hidden nut and

bolt by providing threads on the pressure shell and

a plug and plunger arrangement that can be re-
moved and replaced externally.

Fig. 1.1.32, and the heater distribution panels,
transformers, and associated switches may be
seen in Fig. 1.1.33, with the induction regulators
in the background. Present estimates show an
expected ETU facility completion date, exclusive
of the reactor and its associated cell equipment,
of September 1, 1958. Completion of the cell
equipment is scheduled for December 1, 1958. A
description of the construction and design status
of the facility as of September 1, 1957, is given
below.

Reactor Support Structure

Suppo_rf- Structures and Shielding. ~ All main
supporting steel has been set in place. Installation
of cross bracing, gratings, shielding supports, and

- hanger supports is approximately 65% complete.

Work is now in progress on this portion of the
facility. It is planned that the shielding plates
will be installed during the summer of 1958.
Design drawings are complete for this work, except
for minor modifications. The shielding plate design
is scheduled for completion early in 1958.

NaK Piping. — The installation of the furnace
circuit main piping is complete to the cell wall.
Pumps, furnaces, throttle valves, and flowmeters
are installed. One cold trap has been installed.
Present plans are to install the remaining cold-
trap circuit, thermocouples, liquid-level-measuring
devices, fill-and-drain tanks, and associated lines
and valves after completion of the auxiliary and
isothermal NaK-circuit main piping. All material

for this work is on hand, except the drain valves,

drain tenks, and continuous-level-measuring de-
vices. The drain valves are scheduled for delivery
late in 1957. The drain tanks and continuous-
level-measuring devices are scheduled for delivery
October 1, 1957.

The main piping for the two isothermal NaK
circuits is 95% installed. Pumps, throttle valves,
and one flowmeter are in place. The status of
material for the remaining work is the same as
noted above for the furnace circuits.

A radiator has been installed for one heat dump
circuit. The remaining radiator is scheduled for
shipment approximately September 1, 1957, and it
will be installed in the air duct as soon as it is
received. The two pump bowls for these circuits
are scheduled for delivery September 15, 1957.

The main piping for these two radiator circuits
is preformed ond will be installed as soon as the
pump bowls and remaining radiators are delivered.
The flowmeters are on hand and will be installed
with the pump bowls and the radiators. The status
of the cold-trap circuits, thermocouples, level
devices, drain valves, and drain tanks is the same
as mentioned above for the furnace and isothermal
circuits.

The cold-trap and plug-indicator circuits for the
six NaK systems are prefabricated and ready for
welding .into the main piping circuits. It has been
decided, however, that the plug-indicator circuits
can be eliminated, and they will not be installed.

Main Air Duct. — All major components for this
system are on hand. The section of the duct for
housing the two radiators is installed. The re-
maining sections will be installed following the
installation of the radiators.

Electrical Equipment
P. A. Gnadt

The emergency electrical system, consisting of

the 300-kw diesel generator unit and associated
switchgear and supply cables is 95% complete.
Design work for the normal electrical distribution
system is 90% complete, and will be 100% com-
pleted by November 1, 1957. All completed design
drawings were released to a cost-plus—flxed fee
contractor on June 1, 1957. :

The contracter has installed all vohoge regu-
lators, transformers, motor control centers, heater
distribution equipment, and 85% of the cable trays
in the basement area. Installation of cables be-
tween the induction regulators and the distribution
cabinets is approximately 50% complete. Accept-
ance tests for approximately 125 variable trans-
formers revealed excessive winding temperatures
at the specified ratings. These units are being
returned to the vendor for modification or replace-
ment. These variable transformers are for use as
voltage controllers for o portion of the heater
circuits. The cost-plus-fixed-fee contractor has
completed the control room enclosure, installed

the cable trays ubove the control room; installed
all conduit entrances to the control room through

the roof and floor, and is presently setting the

steel support structures for the NaK motor con-

trollers, resistors, and associated cable troughs.
The variable-frequency drives for the reactor

pumps have been ordered, and delivery is expected
late in calendar year: 1957 ‘The motor-generator

sets ussocmted with the pump drive motors will
be ‘installed by the cost- plus-flxed fee contractor.
The pump’ drive units will be installed after the

reactor - and pumps have: been mstulled in the_'.-

facility.

De5|gn ‘work on pcmel onouts ‘and controls has ‘

been started by the Instrumentation and Controls
Division. Preliminary ponel layout drawings and

Details of the heater designs are bemg prepared,
.and installation and wiring-connection drawings
for the Calrod ond clamshell heaters are to be
completed by December 16, 1957. Heaters and
surface-type thermocouples will be installed after
completion of the NoK piping assembly.

Auxiliary Services
A. M, Smith

Piping drawings for the auxiliory services
(helium, lube oil, air, and water) in the basement
area have been revised. The installation work for
this piping will be done by a cost-plus-fixed-fee
contractor. The removal of some of the existing
pipe and installation of the modified pipe runs were
delayed until August 28, 1957, to allow the elec-
trical forces to complete their overhead work in this
area. Layouts of the auxiliary piping above the
track floor have been prepared. A preliminary bill
of material for items required on this part of the
system have been prepared, and procurement of

some items is now in progress.

After considerable difficulty in obtaining a leak-
tight system, the type R lube package (Figs.
1.1.34 and 1.1.35) delivery was made on June 28,
1957. This equipment is stored in the basement
area and will be installed by the cost-plus-fixed-
fee contractor. Failure of the subcontractor to
deliver leak-tight pumps to the lube package vendor

- has delayed the completion of the type K lube

package. Delivery of this package is now scheduled

these areas, which are being made;to assist in
detail design and to demonstrate equipment, as-
sembly, and change-out procedures, are shown in
Figs. 1.1.36, 1.1.37, and 1.1.38.

Figure 1.1.36 is an elevation view taken looking
southeast at the radiator pit. The circular pattern
in the lower left corner represents the cell; the
special equipment room is in the background. The

air duct, which has not been assembled, will be

located in the upper right corner above the radiator
pit. The tank at the right is the drain tank for the
radiator drain pans. The five vertical tanks are
the main and aquxiliary NaK dump tanks.. The
horizontal tank is the special NaK dump tank.
The equipment structure to the left .of the drain

tank ‘is the NaK purification system for the main

and auxiliary coolant system and consists of the
cold traps, plug indicators, flowineters, valves,
and piping. The rack will be revised to omit the
plug indicators. In the ceiling of the radiator pit
are the main and duxiliary NaK piping, with the
flowmeters and the heat-barrier-door operators.
Figure 1.1.37 is a view looking down into the
radiater pit with the air duct removed. The cell
wall is at the left; the NaK piping and off-gas
penetrations may be seen. The smaller boxes
represent the NaK flowmeters and the larger boxes
represent the heat-barrier-door operators. - The hot
NaK piping penetrations for routing to the radiators
are located between the heat-barrier-door operators.

Figure 1.1.38 is a view looking south from the

cell into the radiator pit at the right and the

Construction Progress

Lump sum contract work on the ART facility has
been completed. This work was contracted in four
stages, as determined by the design program. The
first stage, package 1, included major building
alterations, additions to existing buildings, cell
installation, installation of main air duct, instal-
lation of 1500-kva substation, and installation
of 480-v main switchgear. The second stage,
package A, included installation of auxiliary
service piping. The- third stage, package 2, in-
cluded installation of dlesel generators and facility,
electrical motor control centers, spectrometer room
electrical system, and the spectrometer air-con-

ditioning system. The fourth stage, package 3A,
“which was completed during this report period,

optical tooling was studied and greater familiarity
with these instruments and their adjustment was
obtained by attending an optical tooling course.

and discarded: the ultrasonic process proved to be
extremely slow, and the Elox process was some-
what erratic in operation on Inconel, although it

1.2. COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING
| ~ H. W. Savage

PUMP DEVELOPMENT TESTS
W. B. McDoneald A. G. Grindell
Bearing, Seal, and Lubricant Tests
D. L. Gray W. K. Stair?

An additional seal test was conducted to determine
the effect of increasing the reactor sodium pump
speed from 3000 to 4000 rpm, as necessitated by
an increase in the required sodium head. In a
1000-hr period at 4000 rpm, the seal leakage of
reactor pump rotary assembly was never greater
than that previously observed ot the lower speed,
and inspection revealed no deleterious effects.

A plastic catch basin was fabricated for the
reactor pump rotary assembly test, and a mechani-
cal shakedown stand was fitted with glass ports
to facilitate observation of the oil-sparging system.

At a helium flow of 2500 liters/day down the shaft

annulus, an oil carryover occurred which increased
when the oil-sparge-line gas flow was stopped.
When the shaoft ennulus flow was reduced to 500
liters/day, no oil carryover was observed when the
oil sparge gas was flowing, and oil leckage was
adequately sparged by a continuocus flow of 50
liters/day through the oil sparge line, which
effected a 23-ft vertical lift of the oil. With a
lower shaft ennulus flow of 500 liters/day and a
low oil leakage rate, satisfactory sparging was
achieved by intermittent gas flow. Work is con-
tinuing to establish a detailed sparging procedure
for ART and ETU operation.

The reactor pump rotary seal assemblies have
consistently passed the static 50-psi gas-pressure
room-temperature test which is imposed prior to
installation in a rotary element. However, the
Graphitar No. 39 seal nose mountings in brass,
SAE 1020 steel, and type 316 stainless steel rings
have been found to leak at operating temperatures
between 200 and 280°F, with no appreciable dif-
ference being noted for the different materials. It
is now apparent that further improvement in the
mechanics of assembly and more severe acceptance
tests are required.

A redesigned positioning collar of the lower
Durametallic NaK pump seal has functioned satis-

factorily in a series of tests simulating an ART
reactor cell catastrophe. Various conditions were
simulated in pressure tests of the NaK pump
bearing housing and seal assembly, including oil
system pressures from 0 to 250 psig, both with oil
and with gas in the bearing housing. No failures
occurred with gas pressures of up to 250 psig for
either stationary or rotating seal elements. In one
test with a stationary seal, a 200-psig oil pressure
was applied in the lubrication system without
leakage to the pump tank, which was at 15 psig.

The reactor fuel pump rotary element, aitered for
irradiation testing, was installed in a new gamma-
irradiation facility at the MTR. The facility con-
sists of an 8-in.-dia tube surrounded by racks of
fuel elements immersed in the reactor canal. The
header used for the experiment may be seen above
the cancl parapet in Fig. 1.2.1. After approxi-
mately one week of shakedown operation of the
rotary element, partially spent MTR fuel elements
were placed in the grid to supply the test radiation.
Operation of the experimental equipment was stopped
temporarily for repair of a defective ion chamber,
and a general inspection revealed the equipment
to be in good condition. Testing has been resumed
at the rated pump speed of 2700 rpm, and the
average dose rate is 108 rep/hr.

Aluminum North Head ther Tests
J. W. Cooke? H. Gilkey?

Fuel System. — Operation of the twin fuel pumps
installed in the aluminum mockup of the ART north
head has demonstrated effective removal of air
from the test loop over a wide range of operating
conditions. Degassing times for removal of 0.1
scfm of air ranged from 8.5 min with 3’/2 in. of fuel
in the expansion tank and the pumps operating at
2100 rpm to 1.5 min with 2 in. of fuel in the ex-

pansion tank and the pumps operating at 3000 rpm.

No ingassing occurred at speeds from 0 to 3000

rpm when the pump speeds were equal and some

variation in relative speeds could be tolerated
above 500 rpm. '

per pump, with l/ in. of fuel in the expansion tank,
were 10.5 psi for the pump discharges and 0.8 psu
for the pump suctions.

The performance of one of the fuel pumps was
comparable with that obtained in single-pump tests,
but the head obtained with the other pump was 7%
(2.5 to 3 f1) below that for the single pump at
2700 rpm and 645 gpm. This difference can be
explained by minor dimensional differences in the
impeller and volute.

Sodium System. — Fabrication of the twin sodium
pump loop for testing in the aluminum north head
mockup was completed. Preliminary data showed
that the system readily degassed with the pumps
at equal speeds above 3000 rpm and with the liquid
level in the expansion tank above the ports that
connect the expansion tank to the pump impeller
regions. The pumps shared the pumping lead

equally when operating ot equal speeds. The

loop flow resistance was considerably higher than
anticipated, with most of the higher resistance
being attributable to the sodium-to-NaK heat ex-
changer pressure drop. Examination revealed that
the high heat exchanger pressure drop was caused
by blockage of inlet and flow passages by flakes
of an epoxy resin that had been applied to the
inner surfaces of aluminum components.

Fuel Pump High-Temperature-Performance Tests
P. G. Smith

The fuel pump high-temperature-performance test
loop in which NaF-ZrF,-UF, (50-46-4 mole %,
fuel 30) is circulated was placed in operation again
on June 26, 1957, and has since been operating
continuously. For this series of tests a nuclear
radiation thermal barrier was assembled with the
pump rotary element in order to simulate, as nearly
as practicable, the temperature distribution at re-
actor zero power operation during priming and
purge tests; a bubble-type liquid-level indicator
was installed in the pump fuel-expansion tank; and
four of the seven Moore pressure-measuring devices
were replaced with Taylor instruments.

The head-vs-flow performance tests at 2400,
2700, ond 3000 rpm were repeated, and the dis-
parity in total head between the tests with fuel
and with water was again found to be 1 ft, as
previously reported.3 The total head obtained

Cavitation tests at different operating conditions
(600, 645, and 700 gpm ot 2400, 2700, and 3000
rpm) made during the previous quarter were re-
peated. From the date obtained, curves showing
the minimum surge tank gas pressure and the
minimum suction pressure vs flow for cavitation-
free operation were plotted (Fig. 1.2.3).

Priming tests were made with the fuel at a tem-
perature of 1200°F after having filled the loop to
levels of 0, 9/1 , 2, and 3 in. gbove the expansion
tank floor with the pumps stopped. In all cases in
which the fuel was above the floor of the expansion
tank, the pump primed and gave full head and flow
performance. Without fuel above the floor of the
tank the pump head was about 4 ft low. During
these tests the effects of ZrF, vapor on pump
performance were investigated at various liquid
levels in the expansion tank and for various shaft-
annulus helium-purge flow rates. With the pump
stationary, a purge of 500/liters of helium per
day down the pump shaft was maintained for 46 hr

Fuel Pump Endurance Tests
P. G. Smith

The fuel pump being tested for endurance with
fuel 30 as the circulated fiuid was stopped on
June 4, 1957, after 3550 hr of operation. The
wetted portions of the pump had been thermally
cycled 652 times between 1100 and 1400°F, The
pump lower-seal oil-leakage rate continued to be
5 em3/day, and there was no measurable leakage
from the upper seal. Examination of the impeller
revealed that it had been operating in a region of
cavitation (Fig: 1.2.4). Data on input power at
2700 rpm vs pump surge tank helium pressure,

~which were obtained at the midpoint and at the
end of the test, are plotted in Fig. 1.2.5. The

slight difference in the maximum power input in
these two runs may be attributed to the nonrepro-
ducibility of the instruments used for obtaining
the power data. The 4- to 6-psig range of surge
tank pressures during this test was below that
required for cavitation-free operation.

Disassembly of the hydraulic drive motor revealed

failure of the output shaft bearings prior to termi-
- 'nation of the test. The pump and the test stand
will be put back into operation for further endurance

testing in the near future.

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 1957

for this and subsequent loop cleaning. The results

of tests of the reaction of NaK and lubricating oil
that were made in order to investigate the cause
of the explosion are reported in Chap. 2.5, ‘‘Ana-
lytical Chemistry."’

Since the oil leakage might have carburized the
Inconel components of the test loop, Inconel
samples were token from several areas and sub-
mitted for metallurgical examination. The maximum
depth of carburization was found to be 0.005 in.,
which was not considered sufficient to be harmful
in further test operations. The loop has been
cleaned and reassembled and is to be put back
into operation.

Operation of NaK pump hot test loop No. 2 was
stopped for removal of four of the first set of 3'/-
in.-IPS electromagnetic flowmeters inserted for
calibration and installation of four uncalibrated
flowmeters. When an attempt was made to resume
operation of the loop, it was found that the main

loop flow was restricted to very low values, that

is, 100 to 150 gpm at 3550 rpm with the throttle
valve wide open. Heating of the loop to nearly
1200°F finally restored full flow. The only subse-
quent interruption of loop operation has been an
unscheduled shutdown for replacement of the cold
trap because water was leaking from a ruptured
cooling coil into the loop drip pan. It is believed
that the thermal shock that occurred when a full
stream of cold water (60°F) was admitted to the
cooling coil while the cold trap was at a fairly
high temperature (450°F) hastened cooling coil
failure. A nozzle was therefore devised to admit
a controlled water-air mixture to the cooling coil.
The nozzle has proved useful in effecting a gradual

_transfer of the cold-trap cooling load from air to
~ water on all NaK pump hot test loops, and its use
has ‘been suggested for the ETU cold traps. The

total operating time for the pump in loop No. 2 is

1850 hr, which brings the total running time for
5pr|mory NoK pumps operating with NaK at elevated
temperatures to 6250 hr.

" "Auxiliary NaK pump hot test loop No. 1. was

converted to ‘operation with hot NaK (56% Na)
- during the previous quarter, The initial operation
. of ‘this foop has been devoted to a study of the
"oxide level in.a new NaK loop operating ot an
elevated temperature. The test loop is constructed

mainly of 4-in. sched-40 Inconel pipe, and it holds
approximately 42 gal of NaK, For the oxide-level
study the loop was heated to 1500°F without cold

trapping of the NaK, the cold trap being insulated
and uncooled, and plug-indicator break tempera-
tures were recorded as a measure of the oxide
level in the NaK. Data on plug-indicator break
temperatures were also tcken to observe changes
in the oxide level caused by draining the 1500°F
NaK into the system dump tank, cooling the NaK
and the loop to room temperature, slowly refilling
the loop, and reheating the NaK and the loop to
1500°F. This process was repeated twice. The
data obtained in these tests are presented in
Fig. 1.2.6. The plug-indicator electromagnetic
flowmeter only occasionally showed a sharp de-
crease (break) in flow for a particular plugging
screen temperature during an oxide determination

run, and thus the break temperatures are shown as

ranges in Fig. 1.2.6 rather than as points. De-
creases in the break temperatures with time may
be seen at loop NaK temperatures of 1200 and
1500°F and for each dump-tank cooling process.
The initial operation at a NaK temperature of
1500°F showed an average break temperature of
1250°F (extrapolated to 1350 ppm O,) and the final
test run at 1500°F showed a break temperature of
900°F (575 ppm O,). The first break temperature
for operation at a NaK temperature of 1200°F was
approximately 1175°F (1275 ppm O,) and the last
break temperature for operation at 1200°F was
700°F (225 ppm O,). The process of draining the
hot NaK into the dump tank and cooling it there to
room temperature reduced the oxide concentration
in the system NoK. The oxide level decreased
with time during the initial operation at 1500°F
and increased with time during operation at 1500°F
ofter the 346th hr of operation. Since the com-
pletion of the oxide-level study, 500 hr of high-
temperature. operation has been accumulated with
this pump test loop. Head, flow, speed, power,
and cavitation data for the pump will be taken
during the next quarter.

Auxiliary NaK pump hot test loop No. 2 was
placed in hot operation during the quarter, and
calibration of the first set of 2-in.-IPS electro-
magnetic flowmeters for the ETU and the ART was
completed. Four of the calibrated flowmeters were
removed and replaced by four uncalibrated flow-
meters. During the shutdown a defective liquid-
level probe was removed for replacement and carbon
deposits were found on it. The pump was therefore
removed for inspection, and a lower seal was found
to be contaminated in o manner similar to that

38

found on the primary NaK pump; that is, the seal-
face loading springs were clogged with grease.
The pump was cleaned, reinstalied, and calibration
of the second set of 2-in.-IPS electromagnetic
flowmeters will begin early next quarter. At shut-
down for replacement of the flowmeters, 1070 hr
of hot operation had been logged on this test loop
that brought the total hot operating time for auxiliary
NaK pumps to 1370 hr.

A summary of heat exchanger and radiator test
operations during the quarter is presented in Table
1.2.1. The small heat exchanger stands were shut
down for installation of fest pieces.

The semicircular heat exchanger shown in Fig.
1.2.7, which was designed to simulate the tube
stresses of the ART main heat exchanger, is
currently being instalied in small heat exchanger
test stand B, ond test operation is to start early
next quarter. A description of this heat exchanger
and the test objectives were presented previously.”

A 25-tube heat exchanger, type SHE-7, 8 fabricated
by the Process Engineering Corp. and designated
No. 4, has been installed for testing with the fuel
mixture NaF-ZrF 4-UF 4 (56-39-5 mole %, fuel 70).
This test will be a repetition of the previous test
which was interrupted prematurely after 1438 hr of
operation by failure of York Corp. radiator No. 16
(for details see Chap. 3.6, this report). '

A Black, Sivalls & Bryson intermediate heat
exchanger No. 3 (type IHE-8), which was installed
in test stand B, had survived 168 thermal cycles
and 421 hr of high-temperature operation when the
test was terminated by failure of the furnace inlet
line. Daily spectroscopic analyses of fuel samples
for potassium from the NaK system, which was at
a higher pressure than that of the fuel system,
revealed no evidence of leakage. A first-approxi-
mation thermal-stress calculation had predicted a

thermal cycle consisted of the following con-
ditions, as achieved experimentally: 42 min of
steady-state operation at 1200°%, isothermal;
transition to power over a 50-min period; 40 min
of steady-state operation at power; and traensition
to 1200°F isothermal operation over en 18-min
pericd. Conditions during power operation were
the same as for phase |, and the traonsition to
power was at a constant rate of temperature change.
The transition from power operation to isothermal
operation was accomplished as fast as the thermal
inertia of the test stand would permit, and the
resultant rate of tempercture chonge ot the NaK

at ¢ maximum NaK temperature of 1590°F, it must
be replaced before further testing can be done in
this stand. Because of the ensuing time delay,
the heat exchangers are being removed for ex-
amination and will not be tested to failure.

The test of York Corp. ART test radiator No. 1
was terminated after 870 hr because of a leak in
the tube matrix opproximately ¥ in. from the NaK
inlet header in a tube near the center of the fourth
row from the air outlet side of the radiator, as
shown in Fig. 1.2.8. The leak was noted immedi-
ately following the first power cycle, and rapid
shutdown was effected to limit damage to the unit.
Even so, the tube that lecked was damaged suf-
ficiently by fire to destroy evidence that would
indicate the nature of the failure. Metallurgical
examination of 16 tubes, four of which were in the
in the immediate vicinity of the tube that failed,
did not reveal a cause for the leak. There were no
incipient cracks and no defects in damaged areas,
and no impurities were evident {for details of the
examination see Chap. 3.6, this report). Inspection
of assembled ART prototype radiators Nos. 2 and 3
will be even more rigid that the quite thorough
inspection of unit No. 1. Heat transfer performance,
gir pressure drop, and the increase in the NaK
circuit pressure drop for radiator No. 1, as well
as for radiater No. 2, which is now being tested,
are in agreement with design values.

During radiator removal and replacement, extreme
care was exercised to maintain an inert atmasphere
on the test loop, The ART-type circulating cold
trap was drained but not cleaned: In order to
prevent oxide remaining in the cold trap from re-
turning to the system, the cold trap was water-
cooled at the design NaK flow during the heatup
pericd, This procedure is contrary to the previous
startup procedure of allowmg the cold-trap temper-
ature to increase with the system temperature,

cooling the cold trap with air until water can be

introduced safely, and then bringing the cold-trap
temperature down.  There was no indication of the
oxide plugging formerly observed when the cold-

trap system was kept cold during preheatmg_of the

system, - When the system reached 1200°F, a plug-
indicator reading indicated a systemoxide satura-
tion level of approxurnately 600°F; 48 hr later this
level had been reduced to below the sensitivity

~of the plug indicator (300°F). - This startup pro-

cedure demonstrated that if ‘adequate care is

exercised to prevent OXIdGl’IOI'I of residual NaK -

when o system is cut open, the - cold-trap circuit

need not be replaced prior to restartlng system"

operation,
The excellent pertormance of the cold trap in

indicators from the ETU ond. ART. -During both

the initial startup and the restarting of the system,
the temperature llmltatlons imposed on.the ART by

1500°F a steady increase was noted in the force
required to open the valve. The force required
increased from 865 |b immediately after the 500-hr
closure ‘period to 2100 ib following 400 additional
hours of cycling at 24-hr intervals. There was no
measurable leakage during the test at 1500°F.
Examination showed that galling had occurred

between the Stellite-coated valve stem and the

Inconel bonnet at the outer stem guide where the
surfaces were near 1500°F and were exposed to
the atmosphere. The valve was in excellent con-
dition in all other respects, including the Kentanium
151A seat and plug, and is considered to be entirely

~ satisfactory for service at 1300°F,

A second test valve (designated ORNL-2) which
also incorporates the guided-plug feature, has been
assembled, This valve, except for the valve plug
cermet configuration and the omission of the sodium
cooling jacket, is identical to the proposed ART
fuel dump valve. The plug and seat, respectively,

-are the cermets Kentanium KM and K-162B, the

materials now ordered for the ART valves; however,

‘the plug cermet does not incorporate the mechanical
‘retaining feature of the ART valve, since the new

pieces are not yet available. The valve includes
o double bellows to minimize the chance of fission-
gas release in the event of a bellows rupture in

J. A, Conlin S. Kress'2

Two tests run during this quarter brought to com-
pletion the water flow distribution and head loss
examinations of various regions of the ART sodium
circuit. A test was conducted in order to determine
the proper size for ‘an erifice in the control red
sodium cooling passage circuit to limit flow through
that circuit to 0.032 cfs with the island flow at its
design value of 0.697 cfs. The test piece simulated
the control rod passage below the thimble and
included the Inconel shoulder which screws into
a threaded recess at the bottom of the island. Four
s/1 -in.-thick erifices were tested which had inside

ond which were machined to fit snugly into a
1.422-in.-dia section at a transition to a 0.9«in.-ID
passage. The head loss vs flow relationship for
each orifice was correlated in terms of a loss
coefficient, K, defined from the relationship

AH = KV2/2g

where AH is the head loss (in ft) across the orifice,
V the velocity (in fps) through the 0.9-in.-ID
passage, and g is the proportionality constant
relating force to mass and acceleration. The loss
coefficients are shown in Fig. 1.2.10 as a function
of orifice diameter. |

The second water test was a study of the sodium
flow divider in the volute elbows located at each
ART sodium pump discharge nozzle. These dividers
split the sodium flow from the pumps, direct a
portion downward into the reflector, and direct the
remainder up to the island entrance region. It is
estimated that to obtain the design reflector-to-
island flow ratio of 2.2 at a sodium pump flow of
1.106 cfs, the head loss on the island leg of the
flow divider should be 8 ft greater than that on
the reflector leg. The purpose of this test was to
determine the proper position for the flow divider
tongue and to determine the magnitude of the head
loss through each leg. The test piece, shown in
Fig. 1.2.11, duplicated the ART component dimen-
sionally, except for the flow divider tongue adjust-
ment. A diagram of the test piece as installed in

ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

99.9% efficient in removing NaK vapor,!® was
sectioned and found to have fine droplets of NaK
on the Demister packing similar to those found in

the NaK pump condenser. As a result of these -

tests the development work on the NaK and sodium
pump and NaK dump tank condensers is considered
to be complete. The NaK pump condenser is
presently in use in conjunction with NaK pump
tests to obtain further information on its performance
in actual service.

Zirconium Fluoride Vapor Traps
J. A. Conlin A. G. Smith, Jr,

Plugging of the zirconium fluoride vapor trap
inlet'® was alleviated by increasing the outer-
wall temperature of the inlet pipe to 1600°F, and
the test was continued to completion. The test
included 500 hr of continuous operation at a helium
flow rate of 5000 liters/day from o fuel sump
maintained at 1200°F and 50 cycles of 30 sec
duration at ¢ helium flow rate of 10 scfm from fuel
at 1300°F. There was no observable carryover
of ZrF, to the off-gas line downstream of the trap.
Light powdery ZrF, deposits were found on the
water-cooled coils in the condenser inlet section
and inside the tubes of the rear heat exchanger
section, as shown in Figs. 1.2.16 ond 1.2,17. In
the rear section of the trap, all the tubes were
coated with vapor deposits on the inner surface
down to and covering the surface of the Demister
packing. A section of the packing removed from
one of the 1%-in.-dia tubes is shown in Fig. 1.2.18,
and the depth of penetration of the ZrF ¢ deposit
into the packing may be seen. Although none of
the tubes were plugged, the !é-in. tubes offered
considerabie resistance to flow, and the pressure
drop across the large tubes was sufficient during
simulated dumps to move the packing te the rear
of the trap.

The quentity and physical properties of the
deposits were considerably different from those
of the deposits found previously. A total of 758 g
was measured as compared with the 3400 g expected
on the basis of previous tests. Densities ranged
from 0.55 to 0.88 g/cm® compared with previous
deposit densities of 4 g/em3; similarly, the thermal
conductivity decreased to 0.04 Btu/hr.°F-ft2 from

the previous 0.15 Btu/hr.F.ft2, The small quantity
of ZrF, collected indicates that the purge gas
was not fully saturated, and modifications are
being made in the sump tanks to ensure more com-
plete vapor saturation. The inlet to the trap is
also being changed to a conical section to reduce
thermal losses and to minimize the need for in-
creased heating of this region, since the tempera-
ture range is limited for the ART sodium system,
which provides heating and cooling, as required.
Additional thermocouples are included in the new
test trap to facilitate more precise measurement
of the thermal conductivity of the deposited ma-
terial. This is particularly important, since the
final design of the ART trap cannot be established
until the volume and thickness of the deposit are

established. When the reactor is operating at full
power the surfaces wiil be subject to considerable
beta heating from fission gas decay which will
limit the deposit thickness as a function of its
thermal conductivity. ' '

Other tests are in progress to simulate the effect
of beta heating by radiant heating of deposit
samples in order to determine the effect the beta
heating may have on the physical properties of the
deposited material.

Island Bellows Test
W. B. McDonald
W. H. Kelley, Jr. A. S, Olson

A test of the ART island bellows was undertaken
because of the difficulty of accurately predicting
by calculational methods the stresses to be ex-
pected in this compeonent under service conditions.
The test consisted of cycling the bellows under
conditions of strain, temperature, pressure, and
environment that simulated those of the reactor,
In the test the bellows was compressed from normal
to 0.090 in. in 5 min, held compressed for 25 min,
returned to normal in 5 min, and left in the normal
position for 25 min, The test temperature was
1250°F, and the pressure on the outside of the
bellows was 3 psig for 50 cycles and 20 psig for
the remainder of the test. The inside of the
bellows was at atmospheric pressure. The fuel
mixture NaF-ZrF -UF‘ (50-46-4 mole %, fuel 30)
contacted the bellows on the outer surface, and
the inner surface was in a helium atmosphere.
Sodium was not used inside the bellows because
it would have added little to the value of the test

that was integral with an actuating stem coupled
to an air cylinder. Helium was supplied to the
blonket area and to the inside of the beliows.
Calrod heaters and thermocouples were installed
outside the pot, and the pot was insulated. Instru-
mentation was provided to properly cycle the
bellows ond to indicate and to control the pressures
and temperature. _

A preliminary cold spring-rate test of the bellows,
performed to provide information for designing the
hot test rig, led to a calculated force of 4900 Ib for
compressing the bellows 0.090 in. at 1250°F. The
force actually required during the test was only
2500 b, which indicated that the bellows had been
stressed beyond its elastic limit and had perma-
nently deformed. The bellows leaked after 80
cycles, and subsequent visual inspection showed
numerous peripheral cracks in the center convolu-
tion at the small diameter of the bellows, These
cracks were evident on both the inner and outer
surface and obviously had propagated to form the
leak. The two-convolution bellows was thus proved
to be inadequate for the service conditions.

Fuel Fill-and-Drcin Tank Test
W. B. McDonald
W. H. Kelley, Jr. A. S, Olson

The scheduled operation of the ART may impose
stress and temperature conditions on the fuel fill-
and-drain tank that are greater than those for which
design properties are known with any certainty.
This uncertainty and the obvious consequences of
a tank failure justify the performance of a test to
verify the tank integrity under service conditions,

The test tank is being made as simple as possible
while retaining pertinent structural characteristics
of the ART tank. The principal change from the
ART design is the deletion of one of the two tube
sheets ond one-half the NaK tubes, NaK will be
circulated through the tubes and cocling annuli by
a centrifugal pump, and the NaK will be heated by

‘electrical surface heaters on the piping. A heated

fuel supply tank to simulate the reactor will be
located above the test tonk so that the fuel can
be displaced from the test tank and be heated. Thus
the test tank can be tested under all phases of
reactor operation, including filling, enriching, loss
of NaK pressure, emergency fuel dumping, and
endurance.

 
 

 

 

 

All major components for the test are on hand,
except the test tank. The test site has been
prepared, and the structural steel supporting frame-
work is in place. The pump bowl, fuel supply tank,
and NaK dump tank have been installed, and piping
subassemblies are complete. The test tank is
being fabricated, and bids for the tube-to-tube

scheduled for delivery in December 1957, and
efforts are being made to reduce this delivery time
by simplifying structural features and construction
methods. Control panels are being fabricated, and
the remaining instrumentation and electrical design
work is being completed.

1.3. INSTRUMENT AND CONTROLS DEVELOPMENT'

E. R. Mann

ART CONTROL ROD DRIVE TEST
E. R. Mann C. S. Walker

The ART control rod drive test was terminated
after 3000 hr of successful operation. During the
first 1129 hr of operation, the rod was withdrawn
ond inserted 1161 times. The withdrawal wos at @
slow speed, that is, 370 sec for complete with-
drawal, and the insertion was at a fast speed, that
is, 31 sec for complete insertion, as described
previously.!

After the initial rod-cycling phase of the test
was completed, o series of tests was carried out
in which the rod was fixed at positions spaced
5 in. apart for a minimum period of 200 hr at each
position. The time periods frequently exceeded
200 hr because the 200-hr interval usually termi-
nated at night or on a weekend rather than during
normal working hours. After each nominal 200-hr
period, the time intervals required for insertion
and for withdrowal were measured in order to de-
termine whether there was any reduction in rod
velocity because of sodium having deposited and
frozen on the gears., No changes in the speed of
insertion or withdrawal of the rod were detected.
When the tests in which the rod was held fixed for
a 200-hr period were completed, the remainder of
the 3000-hr scheduled test was taken up by more
rod cycling in @ sequence identical to that used
during the first phase of the test.

The upper surface temperature of the sodium,
which was surrounded by the water jacket, re-
mained constant throughout the test at 230 + 10°F,
except in one instance when failure of a control
component allowed this temperature to drop to
150°F, which is below the freezing point of
sodium. This incident caused no apparent change
in performance of any part of the system.

For the first 1800 hr, the recorder for three of
the thermocouples attached to the wall of the
sodium container was in error by 400°F, and these
three temperatures were 1650°F instead of 1250°F.
This deviation apparently did no damage to the
system.

The rod test system has been dismantled, and
samples of the test sodium have been tcken for
analysis. The Lindsay ‘‘mix'’ rare-earth-oxide
control-rod slugs are clso being examined, os are
the walls of the sodium contaginer. The water
side of the heat exchanger is being examined for
scale formation. [f the results of these examina-
tions are satisfactory, it may be concluded that
the ART regulating rod and its actuating equipment
have met all the specifications that can reasonably
be tested without the actual nuclear tests.

FUEL-EXPANSION-TANK LIQUID-LEVEL
INDICATOR

R. F. Hyland

Bubbler Plugging Tests

The test apparatus was completed that was
being constructed for determining the couse of the
plugging of the helium bubbler tubes of the fuel-
expansion-tank liquid-level indicator. The op-
paratus and operating conditions were described
previously.?2 The system successfully passed a
mass spectrometer leak check, and preliminary
tests of the oxygen- and moisture-removal systems
are under way.

The moisture content of the 200-psi building
helium supply was found to be surprisingly vari-
able. Heretofore, spot checks made on the header
with an Alnor model 7300 dew-point meter showed
an average H,O content of about 0.08 ppm by
volume. On the new apparatus, however, a Beck-
man mode! 179 electrolytic hygrometer is used,
and in one month of continuous monitoring the
moisture of the building helium was found to vary
between 4.0 and 28.0 ppm by volume. The Beck-
man instrument responded very well to liquid-
nitrogen cold trapping of the helium at ofl H,0
concentrations, while spot checks with the Alnor
unit showed no change during the entire monitering
period.

The oxygen content of the 200-psi supply has
likewise been continuously monitored for a one-
month period with a Baker model $$-2 super sensi-
tive Deoxo indicator, The oxygen content has
been found to vary between 12.0 and 14.0 ppm by
volume. The internal calibration of this unit was
checked with an external electrolytic cell, and the
two units agreed to within 2 ppm.

Attempts to remove the small amount of oxygen
with hot metal getters have been unsuccessful
thus far. One type of getter that consists of copper
turnings maintained ot 1200°F appears to be
promising. A 50.0 ppm concentration of O, was
introduced into the system and was reduced to
14.0 ppm by this getter.

Aluminum North Head Expansion Tank Tests

Additional tests of the helium-bubbler type of
liquid-level indicator were run in the fuel expan-
sion tank of the aluminum mockup of the ART
north head in order to further investigate the pre-
viously noted? level changes that were associated
with changes in pump speed. Three bubblers were
installed as indicated in Fig. 1.3.1. Typical dota
obtained during ‘tests with these bubblers are
shown in Figs. 1.3.2 through 1.3.5. When the

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 1957

pump speed was increased, the level at bubbler
No. 1 increased and the levels at the bubblers
Nos. 2 and 3 decreased. Thus the previously
postulated *‘dishing’’ effect on the surface in the
expansion tank is further confirmed. There is an
actual change in level, as indicated by the meas-
uring system. A decrease in pump speed created
an opposite and approximately equal effect. These
tests were all conducted with a static level of
1.5 in. of water in the expansion tank and with the
throttle valve set for design flow ot design pump
speed,

Attempts to confirm these results by using high-
speed photography were inconclusive because of
the difficulty of photographing the level through a
small viewing port on top the expansion tank. The
general direction of the level change, as observed
photographically, agreed with that indicated by
the measuring system, but it was impossible to-
determine the magnitude of the change. Improved
photographic techniques are to be used in further
experiments,

Tests were also run to determine how accurately
the level measuring system would respond to a
change in level with both pumps at design speed
(2700 rpm) and with the system at design flow
(645 gpm). Water was accurately metered into and
out of the system under static conditions and the

quantity required to vary the level 1 in. was de-
termined. The same quantity was added or re-
moved with the system at design speed and flow,
and typical results are shown in Figs. 1.3.6 and
1.3.7. A peculiarity noted in these tests was' that
while bubbler No. 1 yielded consistent results,
bubbler Nos. 2 and 3 gave erratic and inconsistent
results. _ o -

it was felt that severe ingassing of the system
might seriously affect the accuracy of the bubbler

because of its fluid density dependence.. Con-

sequently, a test was run in which the system was
purposely ingassed, and high-speed photography
was used to check the level indicated by the
measuring system. The ingassing was accom-
plished by operating both pumps at 1000 rpm and
then shutting off pump No. 2. The results ob-
tained are shown in Figs. 1.3.8 and 1.3.9. The
indicated increase in level averaged approximately
1.2 in.,, whereas the increase determined photo-
graphically was approximately 0.8 in. No density
error is apparent here because the decrease in
density caused by the ingassing should have
produced a low level indication. Instead, the in-
dicated level was 0.4 in. higher than the photo-

ON-OFF LEYEL PROBES
G. H. Burger R. E. Pidgeon, Jr.4

In an attempt to eliminate failures® of the on-off
probes used in NeK pump bowls, the intemal
copper wire was aluminized to prevent oxidation.
However, these level probes continued to fail at
high NaK temperatures. Further examination of
the defective units showed that the probes failed
because of internal oxidation of the copper wires
and that such oxidation occurred when the copper-
to-Inconel welds were made. To eliminate this
type of failure, the probe was redesigned so that
the copper and Inconel junction could be brazed
instead of being welded. No probes of this design
have yet been tested in service.

There are sixteen *‘on-off’' level probes now in
use in the gas pots of engineering test loops.

The probes in one auxiliary NaK pump test loop
have operated 1640 hr and those in a primary NaK
pump test loop have operated 2162 hr without
failure. These probes are installed where the
NaK temperature is usually below BOO°F. Six
probes are in use in the NaK pump bowls of two
of the pumps being tested. As mentioned above, a
number of these probes have failed and have been
replaced. It is planned to replace all these probes
with the redesigned units as soon as they become
available following complete testing.

MAGNETIC FLOWMETERS

G. H. Burger C. L. Pearce, Jr.*

Calibration and testing of the 2- and 3!5‘5"-
magnetic flowmeters for use in the ART and ETU
were continued according to the program described

‘previously.®  Six 3’4-in. units in lot 1 were op-

erated for 770 hr and six 2-in. units in lot 1 for
1078 hr in NaK pump test loops PKP-2 and PKA-2,
After termination of the calibration test runs on
lot 1, four flowmeters were removed from each loop
and replaced by four uncalibrated flowmeters
(lot 2). Two 3!(‘,- and 2-in. units from lot 1 were
left in the loops for continued testing and to
provide reference to lot 1. Thus far the 3‘4-in.
vnits of lot 2 have operated for 1408 hr ond the
2-in. units for 431 hr. The two 3!5-in. reference
units have operated 2178 hr ond the two 2-in.
reference units for 1469 hr. The units which were
removed from the loops were cleaned, rechamfered,
and inspected in preparation for installation in the
ETU and the ART. Eight magnetic flowmeters
required for the ETU have been delivered and five
units have been installed.

Analyses of the experimental data from the tests
of lot 1 are being made. In general, the results of
these tests with respect to accuracy and reliability
of the units are in agreement with the results
presented previously.® In tests of the lot 2 units,
which were instclled ofter the loops were opened
and rewelded, the oxide level of the NaK appeared
to be higher, as evidenced by erratic loop be-
havior at temperatures below 800°F, and a drop in
sensitivity of the flowmeters at low flows was
observed which had not been evident to such an
extent in the tests of lot 1. The earlier calibration

showed the 3'/2-in. units to be linear to better than
1% over the flow range from 800 to 1600 gpm.
From 600 to 800 gpm at fluid temperatures below
800°F, the sensitivity appeared to drop as much
as 2% in some of the runs. For the 2-in. units of
lot 1, no such decreases in sensitivity were
evident. The effect was inveshgated in the 2-in.
lot 2 units by running the loop at a high oxide
level without the cold trap. The high oxide level
in the loop did not affect the readings at the higher
flow rates (450 to 600 gpm), but the oxide level or
some other factor produced an apparent change in
sensitivity of as much as 4% at lower flow rates
(250 to 450 gpm). The sensitivity decreased with
a flow decrease. The use of the cold trap did not
correct this condition. Effort is being directed
toward determining the exact mechanism by which
the change in sensitivity occurs.

All the :’%-in. mognetic flowmeters required for
the ETU have been delivered end several have
been installed. The units were delivered without

the magnets attached to permit easier installation

and handling. The temperature tests of the units
have been completed and the results were satis-
factory., The tests indicated that the units will
perform in a satisfactory manner without continuous
temperature and magnet flux monitoring. A curve
of flowmeter output signal vs flow will be supplied
with each individual flowmeter.

LIQUID-METAL-LEVEL TRANSDUCERS
G. H. Burger R. E. Pidgeon, Jr.

Construction work was continued on the ORNL
resistance-type level elements for use in the NaK

‘pump bowls. Twenty of these units have been
completed. The first four units completed con-

tained a sand-type (coarse-grained MgO) - of in-

sulating material for the Inconel wires within the
Inconel tube. Additional units were constructed'
with’ fme-gromed MgO powder, -however, in an at-
~ tempt to get more dense packing of the material.

Construction: of the level element containing the

| fine-grained MgO was complicated by the tendency
~ of the packing tool-and the Inconel wires to gall -

and ‘cause improper spacing of the Inconel wires.
After experimenting with packing techniques, it
was decided to return to- the use of the sand-type
MgO for insulation. Some investigation is con-
tinving of different insulating materials for ap-
plications similar to this resmtunce -type level
probe.

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 1957

Two of the ORNL level probes are in operation
in the NaK pump bowls in the PKA-1 and PKA-2
test loops. These probes have operated a total of
835 and 1590 hr (plus 500 hr each in the test rig
prior to installation in the pump bowls). Two level
probes manufactured by the General Electric
Company are in operation in the PKP-1 and PKP-2
test loops, and they have accumulated 4740 and
2162 hr of operation, respectively. Eight addi-

tional units have been tested in the NaK-level

test rig for the total operating times given below:

Nc. of Units Operating Time (hr)
2 3060
2 2340
1 875
1 700

Thus far all failures of these resistance-type level

probes while in operation have been caused by
weld failures, and no failures have occurred during
this quarter,

Recorder readings of the NaK level taken at
NaK temperatures of 1000, 1200, and 1400°F are

for the data taken at 1200°F. The variation in
the zero-level reading with NaK temperature is
shown in Fig. 1.3.11. These data were taken
while the level was being cycled from above to
below the level probe. As may be seen the zero-
level reading corresponds to the maximum output
voltage of the level transducer. Data taken
during this type of test indicate a zero-level shift
of less than 3% over the temperature range of from

below 300 to above 1200°F.

Transducer as a Function of NaK Temperature.

Variation in Zerc-Level Reading of

The shift in the maximum level reading is es-
sentially independent of NaK temperature, as
would be expected, since the output voltage of the
level transducer for the maximum level is only 1 to
2% of the full output voltage. During the 3000-hr
test, the maximum level reading remained essenti-
ally the same after the probe was wetted.

Four level probes were operated for 54 days
consecutively with the NaK temperature being
held at 1200°F and the NaK level being cycled
from below the level probe to near the top of the
probe. The recorded zero-level reading was in-
spected for drift which would indicate a change in
the calibration of the transducer. This reading

60

drifted, but the drift was masked by a drift in the
recorder calibration. A transformer used in the
modification of the recorder was sensitive to tem-
perdture, and, as a result, the voltage span of the
recorder changed by an average of about 10.5%
daily because of ambient temperature changes.
Most of the drift in the zero-level reading was
therefore caused by drift in the recorder calibra-
tion. The recorder modification has been cor-
rected so that the recorder calibration does not
change.’

In order to observe the wetting effect, a new
level transducer was installed and the NaK was
heated to 300°F with the NaK level below the
level transducer. The probe was then immersed
in the NaK, a series of step changes in level was
made, and finally the usual output vs level cali-
bration run was made. This procedure was re-
peated for NaK temperatures of 400, 500, and
600°F. In the 300°F test, the indicated level
continued to rise after the step changes in level
had been made. The indicated level reached to
within 5% of its final value after 10 min and to
within 2% of its final value after 2 hr, The re-
sponse to the level changes at NaK temperatures
of 400°F and up was good. The indicated output
was about 1% of its final value immediately after
the leve! changes.

More tests under more rigidly controlled condi-
tions will be required for a final evaluation of the
wetting phenomenon. It is planned to continue the
tests to determine the exact wetting effects on the
measured level accuracy at various fill tempera-
tures and to find, if possible, a solution to the
wetting problem by using other probe material or
by applying a special coating or plating to the
level probe.

Further testing of the NaK level probes has been
delayed by repairs and modifications of the test
rig. The level probes are installed in the test rig
by clamping them to the NaK pots and sealing
them with O-rings. The seals used leaked vapor,
and, as a result, the test rig had to be rebuilt. .

Construction was begun on ORNL resistance-
type level elements for use in the sodium expan-
sion tank. None of these units have been com-
pleted. Construction was also started on the rlg
for testing these level elements.

The design was completed of the level element
for continuous level measurements in the furnace-
circuit drain tank of the ETU. This probe will be

 
 

 

 

mounted in the bottom of the tank and will have a
30‘{,—in. range. The sensing element will be made
from a single 1J‘,--in_. sched-40 Inconel pipe.

The design of the probe for the auxiliary sodium
expansion tank was completed, and fabrication
work was started. This probe will be mounted in
the tank bottom and will have a linear range of
25/8 in. The unit will be of the single-tube type,
rather than the J configuration. A total of nine

units will be required for tests, operational units,

and spares.

but after that time four of the sheathed assemblies

showed sharp downward trends and finally ex-

ceeded the vendor's lower tolerance limit of minus
3‘4% at approximately 3800 hr. Since that time all
four thermocouples have reversed their downward
trend and are drifting back into tolerance, as
shown in Fig. 1.3.12. A fifth couple that showed
a sharp downward drift that stayed within the
manufacturer’s - tolerance has leveled off and
started o slight vpward drift. The remaining
thirteen couples have, almost equally, shown
either a slight upward drift or a slight downward
“drift. Typical plots showing these slight upward
and downward drifts are presented in Figs. 1.3.13
end 1.3.14. The total drifts for these thirteen
couples have ranged from 2 to 8 degrees over the

~ entire test period, and it seems that the drift is

independent of the test temperature. The data for
all 18 thermocouples are summarized in Table

Drift dota for similar thermocouples tested in
air revealed upward drifts of all couples tested.

for -examination, Metallographic examination re-
vealed no evidence of a leak; in fact, the unit
appeared to be remarkably sound even after the
5000 hr of operation in sodium at 1500°F. |t is
now believed that the temperature cycling of the
fuel and the sodium could have produced ‘‘breath-
ing'’ of the magnesium oxide on the unsealed
connector end and thereby induced conditions
which might possibly cause the downward drifts.
The temperatures were not cycled during the drift
tests in air. Additional drift tests with sealed
samples are being proposed in an effort to de-
finitely establish the cause of the downward drifts.

Thirteen similar specimens and three platinum,
platinum=10% rhodium units have completed over
4000 hr of operation at 1500°F in NaF-ZrF ,-UF,
(50-46-4 mole %, fuel 30). Weekly readlngs were
also taken at 1300 and 1100°F. After the first
1400 hr of operation, three Chromel-Alumel units
started showing sharp downward drifts similar to
those shown in the first 4000 hr in Fig. 1.3.12,

‘and one unit finally exceeded the vendor's lower

tolerance limit at 2000 hr. The drifts of the other
two units hove leveled off, and slight upward
trends have started. The remaining ten Chromel-

- Alumel assemblies showed drift performances

similar to those shown in Figs. 1.3.13 and 1.3.14
over the first 4000 hr. For comparison, the typical
performance of the platinum, platinum—10% rhodium
units as they aged for over 4000 hr in fuel 30 is

The study of drift as a function of time and tem-
perature of similar sheathed thermocouples ond
conventional beaded thermocouples operating in
air has continved. In these tests, all the thermo-
couples were opercted continuously at one tem-
perature. Three temperatures were investigated,
1800, 1600, and 1300°F. The 1800°F test was
terminated after 5000 hr; the test at 1300°F at
6000 hr; and the test at 1600°F is still under way,

with data having been accumulated for over

6000 hr.

Well Thermocouples

The design of a well thermocouple for tempera-
ture measurement of high-velocity, high-tempera-
ture (1400 gpm, 1100 to 1500°F) liquid metals in
Inconel piping has been completed, and several
units were constructed. The thermocouples (two
per well) employed in these units are fabricated
from 20 AWG, solid, Chromel-Alumel wire (ac-
curacy, 13/8 of 1% over range 530 to 2300°F) and
are welded with Heliarc welding techniques to the
bottom of the well. All the ceramic beads used
contain a minimum of 96% aluminum oxide. A
typical unit is shown before and after assembly in

Fig. 1.3.19.

body was turned down to a wall thickness of

0.050 in. This well-body design was tested for
pressure drop effects on a water loop at velocities
up to 1200 gpm. The permanent pressure drop was
less than 2.0 psi ot 1200 gpm. The lag length of
the well body did not extend beyond the 4 in. of
pipe insulation in an attempt to minimize heat
losses and the selective oxidation effect that is
common in long, narrow thermocouple wells used
at elevated temperatures. The thickness of the
well bottom was determined on the basis of
stresses at operating pressures and temperatures.
A value of 0.109 in. was selected on the basis of a
stress analysis.

In order to ensure a reliable and easily re-
producible attachment of the thermocouple junction
to the well bottom, a technique was developed
which permitted the coating of the thermocouple
junction with Inconel without undue burning of the
wires. This ““wetting'’ of the junction simplitied

cleaning of oxide from the thermocouple wires
facilitates the formation of a reliable junction.

alcohol and baked at 1500°F for 1 hr. All wires
were washed with methyl alcohol and air dried.
All well-body pieces were degreased, washed with
methyl -alcohol, and baked at 400°F for 1 hr. All
subsequent handling after the cleaning was done
with clean white gloves. After installation o
clean, coil-spring type of flexible extension will
be provided for each well thermocouple to eliminate

The beryllium reflector in the ART will ex-

power level of the reactor is changed. The most
severe strains in the beryllium will occur in the
region beneath the load ring. These strains will
be produced by the gross radial temperature
gradient across the reflector combined with the

local gradients in the vicinity of the coolant
holes. Superimposed on this strain field will be
the strain concentrations arising from the presence
of the holes themselves. Over any extended
period of operation these strains will be cyclic
in character and can lead to a fatigue crack.

A small-scale experiment has been designed to
test the resistance of beryllium to fatigue cracking
under the tempercture conditions anticipated in
the ART. The test specimen is a short, thick-
walled cylinder with an axial pattern of small
holes (Fig. 1.4.1). The size and locations of
the ‘/u-in.-dic holes simulate the cooling-hole
pattern in the reactor, and the radial temperature

gradient across the cylinder has been calculated
to produce a gross strain variation similar to that
in the reflector.

A forced-circulation loop (Fig. 1.4.2) is used
to produce the thermal cycles. The beryllium
specimen is housed (Figs. 1.4,2 and 1.4.3) so
that both the inner and the outer cylindrical
surfaces are exposed to flowing sodium. Thermal
deformations are produced by the radial temper-
ature gradient across the cylinder. Sodium temper-

atures are controlled so that the test specimen

is cycled between the isothermal and temperature-
gradient conditions at Y-hr intervals, as shown
in Fig. 1.4.4, The first test will be for a period
of 500 hr and will produce 500 complete strain
cycles.

A detailed study of the stress (elastic) distri-
bution in the specimen is under way., Relaxation
methods are being used for this study at present,
but analytical techniques are being considered.

Thermal-Cycling Test of a Welded Core
Shell Model

B. L. Creenstreet

Shells | and Il (the inner and outer fuel annulus
shells) for the ART and ETU are to be made from
rolled plate weldments which will be machined
to the final contour. This method of fabrication
replaces that of spinning, The weld joint lo-
cations are shown in Figs. 1.4.5 and 1.4.6. As
may be seen, each half of shell | has both circum-
ferential and longitudinal welds, whereas fhe
halves of shell Il have two longlfudmul ones.

Stress Anclfsis of Island Bellows
S. E. Moore

~ The geometric configuration of the island ex-
pansion bellows of the ART consists of a fourfold
repetition of the unit shown in Fig. 1.4.7. The
unit is composed of three elements, a concave
flange, a very shallow cone, and a convex flange.
Adequate methods are presently available for
analyzing these shapes,?3 and IBM 650 and 704
digital-computor subroutines have been written
for these and other types of rotational shell
elements. These routines have been applied to
investigate the stress distribution and load-
deflection curve for the complete configuration,

The design condition for the bellows is 300
cycles of 90-mil axial deflection at a temperature
of 1250°F. The stress analysis of the present
design revealed that under these conditions the
bellows would be subjected to considerable
plastic deformation at the outer bend of the
convolutions. Correlation with strain-cycling data
for Inconel indicated that the fatigue life of the
design was less than the proposed 300 cycles,
This was verified in a recent test when the

‘bellows failed after 80 cycles.4

The genera! subroutines mentioned. above have

" been applied to obtain designs of several bellows
 which would withstand the deflection and external
-pressure (20 psi) onticipated within the reactor.

A design has been selected from this group which

- consists of four convolutions of 0,062-in.-thick

to which the lead will be bonded, (4) the north
ring of the equatorial shielding shell, and (5) the
stresses in the steel and lead at the bond surface
as a result of dissimilar coefficients of thermal
expansion,

Eight bolts unsymmetrically placed around the
north ring of the shell will transfer a load of
approximately 30,300 Ib to the reactor support.
The stress in the most heavily loaded bolt was
checked on the basis of the net cross-sectional
area at the root of the threads. Stresses in the
welds connecting the lugs to the steel ring and
the ribs of the steel backup shell were also
examined.

The investigation of the steel backup shell was
based on the primary assumption that the combi-
nation of the steel shell and ribs will carry all
the weight of the lead and the steel. The lead
was not considered to be carrying any load. The
critical point on the shell was assumed to be

located 10'/l in. above the equator of the reactors
where accommodation of one of the coolant tubes

would require that the rib be notched (see Fig.

124

 
 

 

 

 

 

1 )

1.4.8). The analysns indicated that o %-in. rib
combined with a /l -in. shell would suffice,

The north ring of the equatorial shielding shell
was investigated from the standpoint of bending
and torsion. Here it was assumed that the weight
of lead and steel would be applied along one edge
of the right-angle cross section as a uniformly
distributed load. Stresses in the steel and lead
as a result of changes in shield temperature were
investigated at the bond surface. Two conditions
were considered: a slow increase in temperature
of 180°F (that would result in ¢ bond temperature
of 250°F) to simulate the approach of the reactor
to power operation and @ sudden decrease of
120°F (a bond temperature of 130°F) to simulate
shutdown of the reactor. An elastic analysis
based on these operating conditions revealed that
the stresses in both the steel and the lead ot
the bond would remain within acceptable limits.

An analysis of the aluminum water bag is
presently under way. Since the north head is
made of 10 or 12 segments and the equatorial
section of 5 segments, it will be necessary to
examine the integrity of the individual pieces as
well as the whole unit, Preliminary analyses

Stress Anclysis of a Pressure-Measurmg
Instrument

B. Y. Cotton

An analytical study was made to determine the
elastic stresses in a pressure-measuring device
manufactured by the Taylor Instrument Company
(Fig. 1.4.9), The instrument consists of a riser,
two flat circular plates, a cylindrical portion
containing the weldment, and a pressure-trans-
mitting capillary. A sandwich-type diaphragm of
five layers of 0.005-in,-thick Inconel sheet sepa-
rates the fluid being measured from the trans-
mitting fluid,

Under the specified operating temperatures,
creep is on important consideration, and the
pressure forces on the circular flat plates will

the pressure forces are applied for extended
periods of time, the creep deformation will cause
an appreciable increase in the internal volume
of the instrument and will result in instability
or drift.

The anticipated operating conditions for the
instrument vary widely, since the instruments
are to be employed in various test loops in
different fluid environments, pressures, and tem-
peratures. The results of the stress analysis are
summarized in Teble 1.4,1 in order to provide a

APPARATUS FOR ETR IN-PILE TESTS
OF MODERATOR MATERIALS
G. Samuels

A preliminary layout of an apparatus for in-pile
testing of moderator material in the temperature

range of 1500 to 2000°F has been completed.

The apparatus is designed for testing six moderator

78

specimens at one time. The specimens will be

3 in. long ond will vary from ‘/2 to 1 in. in

diameter. The initial moderator materials to be
tested are beryllium oxide, yttrium hydride, and
beryllium metal.

The purpose of the tests of yttrium hydride and
beryllium oxide is to determine their maximum
allowable thermal stress under various reactor
operating conditions. In the case of the beryllium
specimens, the thermal stress consideration is
secondary to the study of compatibility with
various canning materials.

The moderator materials will be canned in
Incone! jockets, and, where necessary, a third
material will be used between the moderator and
jacket.  The beryllium will be separated from

>

 
 

 

 

L}

the Inconel by either chromium, molybdenum, or
an oxide coating on the beryllium. For yttrium
hydride, the intermediate material will be mo-
lybdenum.  Beryllium oxide will not need the
buffer material.

The jacketed moderator specimens will be
centered in a water-cooled nicke! sleeve. The
clearance between the specimen and sleeve will
vary from 0.015 to 0,060 in. depending on the
moderator material, the diameter of the specimen,
the location in the reactor core, and the desired
minimum surface of the specimen. The heat from
the specimen will be removed by radiation and
conduction to the nickel sleeve. Helium or o
mixture of helium ond orgon will be bled slowly
through the gas space. For normal operating
temperatures {about 1500°F), 80% or more of the

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 1957

heat flux is carried by conduction so that the
surface temperature will be very sensitive to
the argon content of the gas, which will thus
provide a convenient means of controlling the
temperature,

Two thermocouples will be spot-welded to the
jacket of each specimen at equal distances from
each end and 180 deg apart. In addition each
BeO specimen will have one thermocouple located
in the center of the specimen at a distance of
3’8 to 3, in. from the end. Only one specimen each
of yttrium hydride and beryllium will contain a

" center thermocouple during any test run, Knowl-

edge of the tempercture difference between the
center and the surface of the specimens will
facilitate the determination of the internal hect
generation rate and thermal stress,

ART FILL-AND-DRAIN TANK SHIELDING
H. W. Bertini

The general method of attack on the problem of
shielding the ART fuel fill-and-drain tank was to
choose a field point on the surface of the shield
and calculate the dose at this point from radiation
emitted from the surface of the tank. '

The sources at the surface of the tank were
considered to be point sources of magnitude

Sv ' - "~ Mev
— cos 0 x,A(———-——) ,
4p sec-steradian

S = Mev/sec.cm? of fuel volume,

g = total linear gamma-ray cross section of
the fuel (cm="),

6 = angle between the normal to the dump tank
surface and the line between the field
point and the point source,

A = area of the dump tank surface represented
by a point source at its center.

The (S, /4mu) cos 6 term is the surface source
strength at the interface between a thick slab
source and a thick slab shield that will give,
essentially, the correct dose rate at the surface
of the shield.

To the extent to which it was completed, the
lead shield was designed so that the dose rate
at any point on its surface was less than 0.2 r/hr
after 100 hr of operation at 60 Mw, 9 days after
shutdown.

Under these conditions, S was calculated for
a fuel volume of 2,5 x 10° em®, and the curves
of decay energy after shutdown given by Moteff!
were used. The 1,65 and 2,55-Mev groups were
the only ones used in these calculations, and the
p volues for the fuel were taken from ORNL-2113
(ref 2) for these energies. In all cases, cos O
was set equal to 1.

Penetrations

‘The problem of penetrations in the shield is

aggrovated by the need to allow for relative motion

of the tank, all pipes connected to'it, and the
tank shield. All penetrations through the shield
are therefore larger than would ordmurlly be
anticipated. '

In the region where the lead shield for the drain
line meshes with that of the tank the dose rates
at 16 field points from 6 point sources were
calculated by using the technique described above.
In addition, the dose rate ot a point at the upper-
most surface of the tank shield from single
scattering in the lead around the drain line was
calculated and found to be within design limits.
At another point in this general region, where
only 3 in. of lead separates it from about :?4 in.
of unshielded drain line, the dose rate was cal-
culated and found to be acceptable, The valve
actuator penetration through the lead allowed the
dose rate in this vicinity to be rather high. A
2-in.-thick, 8-in.-dia disk of lead fitted around
the actuator arms in this region would reduce the
dose rate to acceptable limits,

The pipes for carrying the NaK to heat and cool
the fuel cannot be allowed to penetrate straight
through the shield, because the dose rate at such
penetrations would be prohibitive. A feeling for
the magnitude of the problem can be obtairi¢d by
noting that the dose rate at the surface of the
tank is of the order of 2 x 10° r/hr 9 days after
shutdown from operation for 100 hr at 60 Mw.

By repeated calculations of the direct and
reflected radiation and the radiation incident at
slant angles it was found that the geometry
sketched in Fig. 1.5.1 would meet the shielding
requirements for penetrations in the tank. The
direct radiation was calculated by using the point
source concept outlined above. The reflected
radiation was calculated by using the data given
by Rockwell® to estimate the angular distribution

correspond to ART fuel fill-and-drain tank ganima--
ray energies or material, and the data of Zerby

do not correspond to ART fuel fill-and-drain tank
gamma-ray energies. This calculation appears to
be about all that can be done at this time, how-
ever, and the calculated dose rate is probably in
error by a factor of the order of 2. The dose rate
for radiation incident at slont angles was col-
culated from the work of Peebles.® v

At the bottom of the reactor, the fill-and-drain
tank support penetrates the lead shield.  About

calculated to be ‘about 2.5 x 104 r/hr._ In the_

that the top portions of the lead would be re-
movable in sections. The problem was to de-
termine whether any overlap of these sections
would  be required when they were in place on
the tank.

- By using the method descrlbed above, the dose
rate at a point opposite a /l -in. crack in the
lead which would expose the tank surface was
calculated to be about 120 r/hr. Therefore a
clearance of this size. separating the sections
of the lead would be much too large. |

If the sections of the lead were brought togefher
with no c!earance, but in such a manner that the
%ﬁ-m. steel cladding layers around each lead
section touched and formed a / -in. slab of iren
between the adjoining lead sechons, the dose
rate at the outer surface of the slab of iron would
be about 2 r/hr, which is also not acceptable,
it was therefore concluded that all adjoining
pieces should be overlapped ot about their mid-
thickness.

Incompleted Work

Additional calculations are required for the
shielding of the small lines which connect with
the upper region of the foce of the tank and
penetrate the shield.  Calculations are also
required to determine the dose rate near the
bottom of the shield as a result of scattered and
direct radiation through the penetration in the
lead required for the tank support.

ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

The fuel contribution would be principally from
residual fuel pockets whose probable volumes and
locations are presently not well known. The fuel
pumps, the fuel onnulus around the control rod
in the sodium expansion tank, etc., would con-
tribute about 3 r/hr, with about 2 r/hr being
through the fuel pump . penetrations. On the
assumption that 2% of the total fuel in the reactor
system would remain uniformly distributed in
the main fuel-to-NaK heat exchanger upon draining
of the reactor, the dose through the NaK pipe
penetrations would be about 500 r/hr.

The off-gas line will pass very close to one
of the fuel pumps and part of it will be visible
through the pump penetration. A total of
3 x 1015 Ba'4® nuclides per second® was assumed
to pass into the off-gas line and deposit uniformly
on its surfaces. If it is assumed that a 3-cm
length of off-gas line will be directly visible
through the penetration, the dose rate was cal-
culated to be 260 r/hr from this source. A
summary of this preliminary calculated dose rate
at P is given below:

results (for the six energy groups) were plotted
(Fig. 1.5.2) as Mev/sec for an operating level of
one fission per second as a function of time after
shutdown.  Although data have been available
for the rate of decay of gamma activity for times
of a few minutes or more after shutdown, no data
have been available up to this time for the period

Calculations were made of the heat deposition

drain valves by decay-gamma energy originating
in fuel draining through the valve immediately
after shutdown following 500 hr of 60-Mw oper-
ation. ' :

The total decay-gamma energy deposition rate
at the instant of shutdown was calculated to be
2.5 w/cm® of Inconel, which corresponds to a
rate of temperature rise of about 1°F/sec. |f it
is assumed that fuel remains in the valve for
3 min, which is the maximum allowable duration
of the fuel draining operation, and the decrease
in gamma activity during this period is aliowed

No allowance was made in the calculation for heat
loss from the Inconel piping during the 3-min

INSPECTIONS OF REACTOR SHELLS
A. Taboada G. M. Tolson

Inner Core Shells (Shel_l 1)

Radiographs of inner core shell sections made
by forming, welding, and machining were found
to have *‘white lines’’ in the weldments. Metal-
lographic examinations showed the lines to be
associated with large dendritic grains that ex-
tended through the entire weldment.

Outer Core Shells (Shell 1)

Inspections of spun outer core shells described
previously as “‘in process’’ were completed. The
results of all the inspections are presented in

Table 1.6.1.

It is to be noted that none of these shells are
to be used in the ETU and ART. Complete in-
spection was performed in many cases for checking
manufacturing techniques and quality of the finished
parts and for obtaining data for use in other tests.

Shell 1il

The bottom section of core shell Il was in-
spected by radiography following an intermediate
machining operation. One weldment was found to
contain pores and areas that were contaminated.
No repairs were made on the weldment because
the poor areas may be removed during subsequent
machining. The shell will be inspected again
in the final form. A

NaK heat exchanger tubes was approved after
destructive and nondestructive exomingtion of ten
tube samples submitted by Black, Sivalls & Bryson.
North and south header stress analysis samples
were received, and after repairs of several cracks,
the north head sample was accepted for testing.
The south head stress analysis sample is being
inspected.

The following reports, procedures, and samples
were examined and approved: (1) radiographic
techniques for examination of tube-to-header welds;
(2) a report covering the modification of the
channel-to-web weld joint; (3) samples of and a
report on the bulkhead weld; (4) a report on tube-
to-header brazing covering the use of rings con-
toured to fit the header; (5) braze samples 1 and
2 that illustrated vertical and horizontal brazing;
(6) proposed welding techniques for the channel,
flute filling, inlet pipes, outlet pipes, and the
bulkhead-to-tube-sheet joints.

Midwest Piping Company Forgings end Weldments

Nondestructive and destructive examinations were
completed on samples of hot-forged Inconel re-
ducers which were fabricated at temperatures of
1800 to 1850°F by the Midwest Piping Company.
Metallographic examination revealed the grain size
to be no greater than No. 5, and therefore the
fabrication method was approved.

An Inconel pipe saddle weldment was examined
and approved for design and weld integrity. Also

Inspection was completed on standard NaK tank
No. 2 received from Process Engineering, Inc.,
and it was found to be acceptable for the intended
use. Four other tanks have been received and
are being inspected. Twelve bellows expansion
joints for the ART were also received for in-
spection. '

Fulton-Sylphon Company Bel lows

A sample ETU sodium expansion bellows was
received from the Fulton-Sylphon Company for
evaluation of fabrication techniques, Examination

- revealed that the seam welds on each end of the

unit were porous. Metallographic examination re-
vealed dirt imbedded between each of the three
plys of the bellows. In the weld metal, pores up
to 0.005 in. in diameter were found. It was recom-
mended that more care be taken in the fabrication
of the bellows to eliminate sources of dirt and
contamination.

Hoke, Inc., Inconel and Stainless Steel Valves

Fifteen Inconel and fifteen type 316 stainless
steel valves, which have two welds each, were
received from Hoke, Inc., for acceptance of the
welds. Inspection resulted in the detection of
five defective welds., These welds were repaired
and were found to be acceptable upon re-examination.

METAL IDENTIFICATION METER
A. Taboada  G. M. Tolson

The examination with the metal identification
meter of an ART-type fuel pump after test operation
indicated that a material other than Inconel had
been used. Further tests with the metal identifi-
cation meter and a Spotchek chemical kit revealed
that the labyrinth seal was fabricated of a 300-
series stainless steel. Since material other than
Inconel has been detected in other components
by this equipment,® two additional meters have

that only Inconel is used in the ETU and ART.

The meter now available is being used to check
all components being received from vendors.  The
second meter will be used in the Y-12 Plont
General Shops in order to check all incoming
materials and to check all components that are

Nlckel-Copper Welds in quuld-Level Probes

Several ‘failures- have occurred in the nickel<

copper welds in liquid-level probes. A microscopic -
examination of one of the failed welds revealed -
stringers of copper oxide adjacent to the ‘failure

zone. Radiographs of several other probe welds
showed large pores, whlch indicate high. oxygen
content of the copper.
failed are being examined to obtain comparative
information that will be useful in further investi-
gation of the cause of failure.

A liquid-level indicator which cracked and Ieuked

in five areas was found to have failed because

of ratcheting of the ceramic insulators. The tube
failures were typical of tube-burst test failures
under biaxial loading. A second liquid-level in-
dicator failed because of leakage through a pin-
hole. The initial radiographs taken of this area

were re-examined, but no indication of the defect

was found. Since the unit had also passed dye-
penetrant inspection, the pinhole probably origi-

nated in the inner lead ~weld which- ‘was’ not

accessible for dye'Penetrcmt inspection.  ~

PROCEDURES FOR RADIOGRAPHIC
INSPECTION OF WELDMENTS ON ART ISLAND
AND REFLECTOR

A. Taboada G. M. Tolson

There are seven critical welds on the ART and
ETU which can be radiographically inspected only
through sections of beryllium. Normal radiographic
techniques .cannot be used because beryllium
scatters the .incident x-’rqy beam and causes
general fogging of the film. Experiments are being

90

run in order to determine techniques for obtaining
maximum sensitivity. o

Several radiographic fechniques ‘were used in
the inspection of the equatorial weld on the ETU
island shell assembly, but it was impossible to

estimate the radiographic sensitivity obtainable

by these methods. A mockup of the assembly with
known discontinuities was therefore obtained,
and the sensitivities of the inspection methods are
being investigated. '

preliminary results of @ run (ET-29, Table 1.7.1)
at 1 cps showed test-section attack that was
somewhat greater than that observed at the lower
frequencies. The low temperature amplitude (13°F)
at the outside wall of the test section resulted from
the increased cycle frequency. The observed
intergranular attack of 5 mils with a temperature
tluctuation of only +3°F indicates that the extent
of the attack on Inconel is frequency dependent,
with a critical frequency in the vicinity of ‘é to
1 cps. Additional data are currently being ob-
tained at the 1-cps frequency in order to verify this
conclusion.

The effect of prior strain on the extent of the
corrosive attack on Inconel under thermal cycling
conditions was investigated in the series of runs
ET-30 through ET-34 (Table 1.7.2). For run ET-30,
a fine-grained tube was prestressed to give o fixed
strain, allowed to relax for 24 hr at 1300°F, and

strain imparted is not known. However, it is felt
that the results give at least a qualitative estimate

of the effect of stress. Runs ET-31 through ET-34-

were performed with annealed (as-received) tubing.
Two of these tubes, ET-31 (fine grained) and
ET-33 (coarse grained), were bent as shown in

(fine grained) and ET-34 (coarse grained), were

the attack on the tension and compression sides of

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 1957

Since it is planned to use welded and machined
shells in contact with the fluoride salt in the ART,
a study of the effect of thermal cycling on machined
welds was undertaken. The test sections were
formed by butt-welding two pieces of Inconel tubing
- {0.25-in. OD, 0.035-in. wall thickness). The inside
of the weld was reamed to the original inside tube
diameter, and the outside was machined back to the
original outside tube diameter. The weld was
located approximately 1 in. downstream from the

-heater.  The results of these tests, runs ET-35
- through ET-37, are given in Table 1.7.1. Photo-

micrographs of the weld areas of the specimens
are not yet available. Run ET-35 was made with
a fine-grained tube, while coarse-grained tubes
were used for runs ET-36 and ET-37. Further,
the specimen used in run ET-37 was constructed
by building up ‘4 in. of weld metal on the ends of

~the tubes, machining the weld metal to the original

tube dimensions, and welding the weld-metal

- pieces together. The specimen used in run ET-35

showed the same depth of attack in the weld region
as in the unwelded portion of the tube, with perhaps
somewhat denser subsurface void formations in the
weld. The specimens used in runs ET-36 and
ET-37 both failed in the weld areas after relatively
In all cases the welds were
fabricated by a qualified Inconel welder. However,
since the welds were not critically inspected, the
possibility of initial weld porosity exists. Ad-
ditional tests of this type are to be run with welds
which have satisfactorily passed inspection.

temperature oscillation as indicated by these
thermocouples was 127°F at the test section inlet
and 103°F at the outlet. The inner surface temper-
ature oscillation was estimated to be between
+67 and 195°F. This variation exists because of
uncertainties in establishing the boundary con-
dition at the outer surface in the equation describing
the decay of the radial temperature wave. The
metallurgical examination of this test section has
not yet been completed; however, standard dye-stain
and radicgraphic examinations show no superficial
damage. Future tests will again be made at a
cyclic frequency of 1 cps, but the amplitude of the
temperature fluctuation will be varied.

Thérmocouple Development
Jo E- MO"'

An improved technique was used for further
measurements of the surface temperature of a thick-
walled pipe in contact with a fluid whose temper-
ature is a periodic function of time. An Inconel-
nickel ‘‘gunbarrel’’ thermocouple® was shrunk-fit
into the pipe wall, the inside of the pipe was
reamed so that the junction would be flush with the
wall, and a thin (approximately 1-ux) layer of nickel
was deposited by vacuum evaporation. This nickel
layer introduced negligible resistance to heat flow,
and thus enabled instantaneous measurement of
the interface temperature. The thinness of the
nickel layer ensured negligible perturbation of the
fluid flow in the vicinity of the thermocouple.

Typical resuvits for a test section fabricated from
a 0.47-in.-ID, 0.25-in..wall Inconel pipe exposed
to sinusoidal temperature oscillations in water are
shown in Fig. 1.7.5 for a film heat transfer coef-
ficient of 3700 Btu/hr-ft2.°F, As may be seen,
the results are in reasonable agreement with the
Jakob equation# for an infinitely thick plane wall.

An Inconel-nickel ‘‘gunbarrei’’ thermocouple
(not attached to a tube) was tested in static
NaF-ZrF -UF, (50-46-4 mole %) at 1200°F for
300 hr. During this time the thermocouple indicated
a steady temperature of about 1230°F. Metallurgical
examination of the thermocouple, of which o
longitudinal secticn is shown in Fig. 1.7.6, re-
vealed, however, that the metallic junction between
the central nickel wire and the Inconel had been

clearly in the photomicrograph of Fig. 1.7.7. lt is
concluded that the conductivity of the melt was
sufficient to provide electrical continuity. Since
the fluoride salt was found to have penetrated some
distance along the nickel-oxide insulation, it is
evident that this type of thermocouple cannot be
relied upon for long-term accurate measurement of
surface temperatures in a fluoride salt environment.

tested. One configuration consisted of a pair of
inserts and ramps mounted at each pump discharge
port. The insert, one side of which maintained the
circular contour of the core entrance passage,
while the opposite side provided a gredual area
transition for flow from the pump discharge, was
installed at the junction of the center volute and
pump-discharge passage and occupied a 38-deg
circumferential sector. It extended the full height

of the volute. The ramp was located on the roof -

of the center volute and occupied a 50-deg radial

sector adjacent to the insert. The shapes and the

positions of the inserts and ramps are shown in
Fig- ]07-8'-

For the second configuration, a pair of thin
(approximately l/a-in.) Plexiglas baffles, similar in
contour to the actual core shells, were suspended
in the annular passage between the island and
reflector shells, as described by Platus,$ to form
narrow (approximately 7/a-in.--wide) annuli adjacent
to the island and reflector walls. The baffles
extended approximately three-fourths of the length
of the core.

The first configuration (inserts and ramps) was
designed to increase the tangential component of
pump-discharge flow into the center volute. At
the same time it was intended to provide more
uniform flow distribution circumferentially into
the core annulus by increasing the velocity of
pump discharge ond by providing a downward
velocity component to the swirling fluid mass.
Observation of the flow pattern revealed no major
improvement in stability even when used in con-
junction with the GS-2 guide vanes. However,
additional tests are needed to properly evaluate
this design.

The second configuration (baffles) was proposed
primarily to improve the flow stability adjacent to
the core shells, to absorb some of the thermal
oscillations in the main stream, and to decrease
the peak fluid temperature near the inner and outer
wails. Preliminary work has been concerned with
obtaining proper flow in the three parallel channels
formed by the baffles. Qualitative observations
indicated that satisfactory flow could be achieved
by controlling the area of the inlet passages.
Many more experiments will be required to optimize

the design and to ascertain the effectiveness of
these baffles.

Quarter-Scale Core Studies
G. L. Muller?

Velocity and pressure loss data were obtained in
water flow tests of the "’(“-scule model of the
ART 21-in. core with an ART-type entrance header,
a core inlet collimator, and five core screens.
The core and header system are shown in Fig. 1.7.9.
The collimator was fabricated from a 3/8-in.-thick
perforated plate of 0.42 solidity. The screens
were cut from 20 x 20 mesh, commercial, woven-
wire screening. The first four screens had a 0.385
solidity, while the final screen was of 0.510
solidity. , :

The velocity distributions at six axial positions
clong the core are shown in Fig. 1.7.10 for a
mid-plane Reynolds modulus of 6020. These profiles
were cbtained from analysis of photographs of the

. velocity profiles visualized at these positions by

the phosphorescent-particle technique (see Fig.
1.7.13 of the next section). Because of the
entrance collimator, the core flow was nontotational.
The results are in good agreement with previously
reported qualitative data on this system.? The
profiles at positions C, D, and E indicate that
comparatively low velocities exist near the
outer wall in the mid-plane region. A prelimi-
nary examination of velocity data obtained at
NRe,mia = 25,000 for the mid-plane region showed
no major deviations from the profiles of Fig.1.7.10.

The experimental variation of average fluid
velocity with axial position is given by the data
points of Fig. 1.7.11. The positions A°and D’
are located in a vertical plane rotated 90 deg from
the plane containing positions A through F. The
curves shown were calculated on the basis of flow
continuity by using the data at positions A and A’
for base points. The reliability of the experimental
data is indicated by the excellent agreement be-
tween the measured average velocity at position
F and that predicted by the calculated curves. The
average fluid velocities are equal at positions A

and A’ however, a 10% deviation exists at

positions D and D’. This difference lies within
the experimental error at this position.

Thus, the data indicate a core flow which is
peripherally symmetrical despite a large pressure
variation in the core header. The extent of this

comparison, the relative pressure difference across
this core is 160 (7.76 psi).

Data have also been obtained for simulated
single-pump operation in the screen-filled core
model. A preliminary evaluation of the data shows
a relative pressure loss across the core of 220 at
one-half the design flow rate. At this same flow
rate the header relafive pressure difference was
200. No apparent change from the data of Fig. 1.7.10
was noted in either the radial or peripheral velocity
distributions. .These data indicate that, on the
basis of core flow distribution, single-pump oper-
ation with a screen<filled core is feasible.

Further investigations are planned with a 0.33
solidity entrance collimator to determine whether
the core pressure loss can be lowered without
adversely affecting the core velocity distributions.
From the present results, it appears that screens
of higher solidity are needed in at least the two
downstream positions to flatten the mid-plane
velocity distributions. This will be checked in an
additional study.

Instantaneous Velocity Profile Measurements
' F. E. Lynch
Velocity profile photographs were obtained for

flow through the 19/ 14-Scale model of the ART with
an ART-type entrance header, a core inlet colli-

mator, and five core screens. The experimental

system is as described in the previous section
(see Fig. 1.7.9). Photographs were taken at the
six axial positions A through F and at positions A’

~and D’ for twin-pump operation and ot positions A

and B for single-pump operation. Typical velocity
profile photographs are shown in Fig. 1.7.13 at
positions C and E. The lack of sharpness in the
photographs results partially from the fluid mixing
brought about by the screens and partially from
the slow shutter speed (% . sec) of the camera.
This study will be repeated with a 35-mm comera
(faster shutter speed) and a Reynolds modulus
higher than the 6000 to 9000 used for the present
test in order to obtain more sharply defined profile
photographs. Screens of various solidities will
also be investigated. :

In order to obtain quantitative velocity infor-
mation, it is necessary to obtain a photograph of

The experimental system is nearly identical to

HEAT TRANSFER EXPERIMENTS
N. D. Green W. R. Gambill
ART-Type Core with Screens

Initial experiments have been completed on the
half-scale volume-heat-source ART core model
containing four 0.342 solidity screens and an inlet
collimator.  Both steady-state and fluctuating
temperatures were measured at the inner and outer
core walls. The transient data are compared in
Fig. 1.7.16 with datc obtained in previous measure-
ments1! of a vaned entrance system. While the
magnitude of the outer wall temperature fluctuations
peak is appreciably above the corresponding value
for the vaned core, the inner core fluctuations

have been reduced by an order of magnitude. In-

Fig. 1.7.17 the corresponding steady-state temper-
ature distributions are presented. The inner wall
temperatures lie consistently below the fluid
mixed-mean temperatures and indicate uniform
high-velocity flow along the inner wall. These
results are in good agreement with predictions made
on the basis of the velocity profiles experimentally
determined by Muller and Lynch? (see also,
Fig. 1.7.10, this chapter). Thus, some hydredynamic
instability in the mid-plane region on the outer wall

materially affecting the inner wall flow lies in
introducing ‘screens of variable radial solidities.
Screens of this type would have high pressure
drops (high solidity) through the central portions
that would force greater peripheral flow. Several
such experimenta! screens have been designed and
are now being fabricated.

Vortex Tube

Preliminary experimental determinations have
been made of the heat transfer coefficients for air
in source vortex flow. The measurements were
made by using metal Hilsch-Ranque tubes having
length-to-diameter ratios of 20. The tubes were
heated by the axial passage of a high-amperage
electrical current through the tube wall. The data
are shown in Fig. 1.7.18, in which a meodified
Colburn factor is plotted as o function of the
energy required per square foot of heat transfer
surfoce. For tubes of identical geometry and the
same over-all pressure drop, heat transfer in
straight turbulent flow and in source vortex flow
can be directly compared. On this basis, the
experimental data of Fig. 1.7.18 show vortex flow
to be a factor of 5 better than straight flow. The
correction to the vortex flow data to account for
the pressure drop associated with the momentum
increase of the air in passing from the tube inlet
to exit has not been included in this analysis.
The magnitude of this correction will be experi-
mentally determined in the 3-in. vortex currently
under construction. This tube will allow radial
and axial traverses of fluid velocity, temperature,

LIQUID-METAL VOLUME-HEAT.SOURCE
' EXPERIMENT
G. L. Muller

An investigation of heat transfer in a liquid

metal (mercury)system with internal heat generation

is in progress. This study is aimed at a better
understanding of the heat transfer mechanism so
that more accurate calculation of the thermal
structures in circulating-fuel reactors can be made.
Discrepancies between results from experimental
fiquid-metal forced-circulation heat transfer studies
and theoretical calculations have raised questions
as to the validity of corresponding analyses for
the volume-heat-source case. In particular, the
“*interface thermal resistance’’ theory postulated
to explain the reduced values of the experimentally
measured Nusselt modulus when heat is transferred
through the tube wall will be tested in this study.

A diagram of the experimental system now being
constructed is shown in Fig. 1.7.19. Mercury wil!
flow from the sump into the Moyno pump, through a
flow=measuring orifice, through the test section
and ccoler, and then return to the sump. In an
additional flow path, the mercury will bypass the
test section and cooler.

The test section is a l(“-in. glass tube interrupted
by three electrodes for volume electrical heating.
The arrangement is such that no heat is generated
outside the test section. The wall temperatures
of the test section will be measured by copper-
constantan thermocouples attached to the outside

of the glass tube. To prevent heat loss through
the test section wall, external insulation and guard
heating will be provided. Fluid mixed-mean inlet
and exit temperatures will also be measured. In
this apparatus Reynolds moduli of 500,000 can be
attained. A second test section of 1%-in.-ID glass
tubing will be available with which to make radial
temperature and velocity traverses.

MASS TRANSFER
J. J. Keyes, Jr.

A comparison with experimental results12.13
of the amount of mass transfer to be expected in
alkali metal-alloy systems was made for two
assumed diffusion mechanisms.'4  The results
are presented in Table 1.7.3. In the first mecha-
nism, the boundary layer was assumed to be satu-
rated and the rate of transfer was limited by the
rate of diffusion of solute into the liquid. A general
expression was derived that included effects of
variation in temperature and liquid composition
around a closed loop and which simplified under
certain conditions to

W(O) = k, Sty — t.)0,

where W(@) is the amount of mass transfer in time
0, k; is the conventional mass transfer coefficient,

ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

Based on extrapolation of some data for the
diffusivity of nickel, as reported in the literature,
W(@) was estimated to be between 2 and 25 g for
ty = 1500°F, ¢, = 1200°F, 6 = 1000 hr. As may
be seen, this estimate is in better agreement with
the observed mass transfer accumulation than was
the estimate based on liquid diffusion. On the other
hand, the wall diffusion mechanism does not
correctly account for the dependence of the mass
transfer (W) on flow rate and time and does not
predict a sharp break in mass transfer at cbout
1350°F. It is concluded that ¢ more general
hypothesis is needed for combining the mechanism
of hot-zone attack with o nucleation-deposition
mechanism in the cold zone.

PHYSICAL PROPERTIES
W.D. Powers
Enthalpy and Heat Capacity

Studies were made to determine the enthalpies
and heat capacities of the eutectic mixtures LiCl-
SrCl, (22.5-77.5 wt %) and LiCl-BaCl, (32.2-67.8
wt %). Preliminary analyses of the dzata yielded
values for the heat capacities of 0.21 Btu/1b.°F
for the barium-containing mixture and 0.24 Btu/1b.°F
for the strontium-lithium salt. The reliability of
these data is in some doubt, since wide dis-
crepancies in enthalpy were observed between
duplicate test samples. This may be due to the
large density differences between the salts.
Further studies with this pair of chloride eutectics
will be made as soon as new samples can be
prepared.

Thermal Conductivity

Modification of the variable-gap thermal conduc-
tivity device to include a large guard heating ring
surrounding the heat meter has been completed.
This guard heater ensures lower heat losses from
the heat meter and at the same time provides a
heat flow path of cross section more nearly equal
to the cross-sectional area of the sample heater
ond its guard.

The results obtained with the salt mixture
NaNO,-NaNO,-KNO, (40-7-53 wt %) show increased
consistency ioth within runs and between runs.
The results of a number of typical experimental
runs are shown in Fig. 1.7.20. In this plot, the

Properties of Zirconium Fluoride Vapor Deposits

The density of a sample of zirconium fluoride
powder collected in a "*snow’’ trap was measured
and found to vary between 0.55 and 0.8 g/cm3.
The samples were collected by pushing a thine
walled, sharp-edged tube through the ZrF, and
into contact with the metal surface to which the
powder was adherings. The thickness of the
sample, whose area was defined by the inside
cross-sectional area of the tube, was determined

by averaging the depth ‘indicated by a fine-wire

probe inserted at four positions immediately

adjacent to the sample. The sample thicknesses.

varied from 0.05 to 0.4 in. It was found, for sample
thicknesses greater than 0.1 in., that the density
varied inversely with the sample thickness, as
shown in Fig. 1.7.21. Tests have also been
initiaoted to determine the effect of subsequent
heating on the apparent density of the ZrF , deposit.

An attempt was also made to measure the thermal
conductivity of the ZrF , deposit. A sample of the
material was ploced in o cylindrical annulus
surrounding a central heated tube. The conductivity
of the material around the *‘hot wire’’ is determined
from the temperature rise of the electrically heated
wire. A value of 0.45 Btu/hr-ft-°F was obtained;

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 1957

however, this measurement was made on a
‘*disturbed’’ sample, and it is planned to mount @
tube in @ snow trap and allow the ZrF , to collect
on the tube.

2.1. PHASE EQUILIBRIUM STUDIES'

C. J. Barton

THE SYSTEM KF-UF
H. A. Friedman

Further equilibrium studies of the system KF-UF
have confirmed the liquidus curve presented
previously.? Results of thermal-gradient quenching
experiments have shown, however, several differ-
ences from the phase behavior proposed earlier on
the basis of thermal analysis and optical and x-
ray-diffraction examinations of slowly cooled melts.
Of the eight KF-UF , phases reported by Zacharia-
sen,® two phases, B-2KF-UF, and KF.2UF,,

have been shown to be equilibrium phases in the

system. |t has not been definitely determined
whether 2KF.UF, displays distinct temperature
ranges for the ordered (B) and disordered (8°)
forms. Further, no evidence has been found that
the phases designated by Zachariasen as
o-3KF.UF,, B-3KF.UF,, o-2KF.UF,, KF.UF,
(which occurs, rather, as 7KF «6UF ), KF- 3UF4,
and KF.6UF, occur in slowly cooled melts or in
quenched samples purified by hydrofluorination and
subsequently protected against exposure to the
atmosphere. 1f, however, such samples are pre-
pared exactly as described by Zachariasen,* that
is, exposed to air during heating and cooling, the
phases designated an3KF-UF4, B-3KF'-UF4, and
KF.6UF, can be formed in large amounts. No
phase that fits the description of the compound
KF.:3UF, has been found under either type of
exper:mental condition. In thermal-gradient
quenching experiments the phuses a and
B-3KF.UF, are apparently stable if initially
present in 1he samples. Protected purified melts of
the composition 3KF.UF, show a biaxial-negative
blue-green phase upon solld:ftcahon, and thermal-

gradient  quenching experiments and - “thermal

analysis indicate that this is the only equilibrium

phase for the compound 3KF UF4. No snmllar

phase has been reported by Zachariasen. The
phases a- and B-3KF.UF, and KF-6UF, may be
either metastable phases in the system KF-UF,
that are stable against inversion to equrhbnum
forms or oxygen-containing phases.

Zachariasen has reported a face-centered cubic
form (a) and two hexagonal forms (8, end B,) for
the compound 2KF-UF ,. If the alpha form were to
display phase behavior similor to that of the
isomorphous phase® reported to be a-2NaF-UF 4 it
would be observed as a primary phase at fhe
35 to 40 mole % UF, region, and its formula would
be 5KF-3UF,. No such primary phase for a cubic
material has been observed. The possibility of a
subsolidus existence for the cubic phase is not
precluded, although the phase has not been ob-
served within the 50°C temperature range below the
solidus. No observations of 2KF-UF , samples have
yet permitted a distinction of the ordered and dis-
ordered hexagonal forms. No well-crystallized
samples of 2KF:UF , have become available. The
compound 2KF.UF, has a lower limit of stability
of 620°C, at which temperature it decomposes into
3KF«UF, and 7KF-6UF,. Some unexplained low-
temperature thermal effects in the 2KF-UF, com-
position region require that this decomposition
temperature be considered to be tentative,

The equilibrium phases in the system KF-UF, and
their melting choracteristics are given in Table

2.1.1.

THE SYSTEM NuF-HfF‘
H. A. Friedman

Samples of pure, sublimed HfF , became available
during the quarter that were pure enough to per-
mit refined phase equilibrium studies of the system
NaF-HfF . Thermal analysis data obtained with
the pure materwl are in substantial agreement with
data obtained in thermal-gradient quenching experi~
ments, and thus some of the phase equilibrium
results based on previously reported® . thermal
analysis data are presently in doubt. Precision in
‘the determination of liquidus and solidus temper-
atures and temperatures of polymorphic tronsitions
has been improved to +3°C, in several cases, by
using sublimed HfF,. A tentative phase equi-
librium diagrom of the system NaF-HfF , is shown
in Fig. 2.1.1. Areas outlined by dashed curves are
not yet well-established.

THE SYSTEM KBF ,-NaBF,
R. E. Moore

A quenching study of the system KBF (NaBF
was undertaken during the past quarter as part of cl
search for low-melting salt mixtures for use as
reactor coolants, Thermal data obtained pre-
viously?¢® defined a liquidus curve with a mini-
mum at about 90 mole % NaBF, and 360°C, but
there were no thermal effects on the cooling
curves that corresponded to solidus temperatures,
Thermal effects that presymably represented solid
transitions were found. in the range 180 to 280°C.

~Petrographic examinations of quenched samples
gave liquidus values that were in good agreement
with the thermal data. The liquidus temperatures
at 50, 70, and 75 mole % NaBF , were 441, 392,
and 387°C, respectively, with KBF, as the pri-
mary phase; the solidus temperatures were 356,
360, aond 355°C, respectively. The secondary
phase was identified as NaBF in each case. At
80 mole % NaBF , the primary phuse is KBF,, and
the solidus temperoture is 358°C. The composition
containing 90 mole % NaBF, is very near the
eutectic.  The primary phase is NaBF,; the
liquidus temperature is 355°C; and the solidus
temperature is 351°C.

X-ray diffraction and petrographic examinations
of previously equilibrated quenched samples
provided no indication of the existence of either
compounds or solid solutions in the system. |t is
a simple binary system with a eutectic near 90
mole % NaBF , and about 375°C.

has been brought to a successful conclusion. In
order to determine the effect of the solvent on the
behavior of NiF,, it is pertinent to compare the
experimental values of the equilibrium quotients
with corresponding values of equilibrium constants
obtained by extrapolation of the experimental data
to infinite dilution and by calculations based on
the vclues, available in the literature,? of the
free energy of formation of the solid NiF, and
gaseous HF, _

The values obtained at 550, 575, 600, and 625°C
for K_ for the reaction of NiF, with hydrogen are
plotted in Fig. 2.2.1 as a function of concentration
of nickel in the melt. The values of K, are,
within the accuracy of the experiments, inde-
pendent of the direction from which equilibrium
was approached and independent of the concen-
tration of Nil"'2 in the solution. Furthermore, as
may be observed, the extrapolation of the data to
infinite dilution presents no difficulty.

 

21, Brewer et al., Natl. Nuclear Energy Ser. Div. IV
198, 65~110 (1950).

The numerical value of the activity coefficient
of NiF , depends on the choice of standard state of
that compound. Calculations have been made and
values are tabulated for each of the following three
standard states: (1) solid crystalline NiF,,
designated NiF ,(s); (2) a hypothetical liquid
supercooled to the reaction temperature, following
a suggestion by Hildebrand and Scott,3 designated
NiF,(I); and (3) NiF, dissolved ot unit mole
fraction [designated NiIg o(@)] and assumed to have
the same activity coefficient as at infinite dilution,
that is, an activity coefficient of 1.

Values for the free energies of formation of
HF(g) and the standard states NiF,(s), NiF,(Z),
and NiF ,(d) are given in Table 2.2.2. The values
for NiF ,(s) and for HF(g) were taken from the
publication of Brewer et al.2 In order to compute
AF® for NiF ,(1), the melting point of 1300°K and
a temperature-independent heat of fusion of 8000

The values of AF® for NiF,(d) were obtained by
extrapolation of the K, data to infinite dilution
to establish K_ for the reaction in which NiF ,(d)
is the standard state. The free-energy changes of
the reduction reaction were then calculated and
combined with the corresponding AF° for HF(g)
to yield the tabulated results. _

The values calculated for the equilibrivm
constants, K_, for the chemical reactions, along
with the activity coefficients of NiF, for each of
the three standard states, are shown in Table 2.2.3.
A  comparison of the calculated equilibrium

PERIOD ENDING SEFTEMBER 30, 1957

constants obtained for NiF _(s) as the standard
state and the experimental vu:iues, as presented in
Fig. 2.2.2, reveals a striking discrepancy between
the calculated and the experimental values. The
discrepancy is directly reflected in the very large
values of the activity coefficients obtained when
the solid and the supercooled liquid are chosen
as standard states for the NiF,. If NiF,(d)is the
standard state, however, the activity coefficient is

 unity as a consequence of the constancy of the

experimental equilibrium quotients obtained. This
is equivalent to stating that NiF, obeys Henry's
law over the concentration range studied, which
includes, ot 550°C, values not far from the concen-
tration of NiF, in the saturated solution.

The temperature dependence of the experimental
K, values and of the calculated K values for the
reactions involving NiF,(s) and NiF () is shown
in Fig. 2.2.3. The heats of reaction calculated
from the slopes of these lines and the corre-
sponding entropy changes are summarized in
Table 2.2.4.

The heat of reaction calculated from the temper-
ature dependence of the experimental values is in

The values presented in Table 2.2.5 are these
to be used for relating the behavior of FeF, and
NiF, in the NaF-ZrF, solvent to the thermo-
dynomlc estimates founj in the literature.2 The
experimentally determined activity coefficients for
NiF, are high enough to throw doubt on the validity

- of the estimates in the literature. A further

discussion of this point is presented in the

ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

formation of solid NiF, (ref 2), the activity coef-
ficient of NiF, in NaF-ZrF, (53-47 mole %), as
determined by equilibrium measurements made with
H:2 as a reducing agent, is 2 x 10° at 600°C, ond,
based on o comparison of NiF, with FeF, by
means of emf measurements on Ni and Fe electrodes
in the NaF-ZrF, (53-47 mole %) solvent, the
activity coefficient of NiF ., at 650°C is 1.8 x 103
(see subsequent section o? this chapter on *‘EMF
Measurements in Molten Salts”). | .
The agreement between the results from the emf
studies and the equilibrium studies indicates that
the high values for yy,p cannot be attributed

entirely to experimental error. Since the activity
coefficient reflects any approximations in the
published estimates used in the computations, it
was of interest to examine the numerical factors
closely in a search for leads to revised estimates.

In order that the activity not exceed unity, the
activity coefficient, y\,¢ (sy based on the solid

as the standard state should not exceed 5 x 102 at
600°C, because the solubility at 600°C is greater
than 2 x 10~3 mole fraction. (Blood, Redman, and
Topol® found the NiF, solubility to be about
2 x 10=3 mole fraction at 600°C.) The saturating
phase is a compound of NiF, and other com-
ponents, and the compound Ni|=22 is more soluble
than the saturating phase, or, in other words, o
solution saturated with NiF, is metastable with
respect to g solution less rich in NiF, in equi-
librium with o ternary compound. Thus, if the
solubility data are correct and if the discrepancy
in the activity coefficients is assumed to result
solely from the estimated value of the free energy
of formation of NiF,, then the free energy of for-
mation must be shifted to a smaller negative value
by an amount sufficient to provide at least a
factor of 4 in the activity coefficient. At 600°C
this amounts to about 2.5 kcal, which would revise
the free energy of formation from —128.0 keal/mole
to —=125.5 keal /mole.

Further information on the plausibility of the
high values for the activity coefficients of NiF
can be obtained from considerations of coefficients
based on pure liquid as the standard state. For
the pure liquid, ideal behavior corresponds to an
activity coefficient of unity, and this sets an
approximate upper limit to the activity coefficient

of Nin. This stotement is based on previously
discussed correlating principles that involve the
charge-to-radius ratio  Z/R and which . indicate
that positive deviations will not be -found in
mixtures of ions of low polarizability.é6 Moreover,
there is little reason to expect much difference in
the behavior of Ni** and Fe** in dilute solution.
The conversion of activity coefficients based on
the solid as the standard state, y(s), to those

based on liquid as standard state, y{I), requires a

knowledge of the melting point and the heat of
fusion of the solute. When Brewer's7 estimates
of the values of these quantities are employed,
YNIF, (1) is 560 at 650°C and YFeF 1) is 0.66
at the same temperature.

There is a good possibility that the estimates for
NiF, given by Brewer are incorrect, and therefore
an alternative method of estimation has been
developed. The alternative method depends on @
comparison between the behavior of MgF.,, for
which a phase diagram is available,® cmj that
of NiF ,, for which the requisite phase diagram data
are missing.

Since the charge-to-radius ratio Z/R of MgF,
is the same as that of NiF,, the NaF-NiF, system
should show the same deviations from ideality
as the NaF-MgF , system shows at the same compo-
sitions. At a given liquidus composition the
activity of MgF , in the NaF-MgF , binary should be
the same as the activity of NiF, in the NaF-NiF,
binary. The equation for the activity of the
separating component at the liquidus is approxi-

The approximate value of the melting point of

that is 44% NaF ond 56% NiF, is reported to be

ature, T, of a 44% NaF and 5% MgF, mixture is

comparable systems and represents an improvement
over the direct visual extrapolation from the
published diagram.® The estimated melting point
of NiF, is then about 1825°K, or 1550°C. Pre-
liminary experiments indicate that this value for
the melting point of pure NiF, is approximately
correct. The calorimetrically measured heat of

fusion of MgF, is 13,900 cal/mole and the entropy

of fusion is 905 eu (ref 10). By utilizing the
and the
assumption that the entropy of fusion is the same
for NiF, as for MgF,, y(I)/y(s) for NiF, was
calculated at various temperatures, T, from Eq. 1.
The values obtained are presented in Table 2.2.6,
together with values based on Brewer's estimates.”
Apparently Brewer’s estimate of 1300°K for the
melting point was 500°K too low, and his value
of 8000 cal/mole for the heat of fusion was low by

o factor of 2,

The tentative values gwen in the second column
of Table 2.2.6 are much lower than those estimated
with the use of the values given by Brewer (third
column). A more definitive set of conversion
ratios must await a more detailed study of the
NaF-NiF, phase diagram and, more importantly,
a better value of the melting point of NiF

REDUCTION OF UF‘ BY STRUCTURAL METALS
Jo Do Redman

Data obtained from filtration studies of the
reduction of UF , by vanadium metal in the reaction
medium NaF-LiF-KF (11.5-46.5-42 mole %), as
reported previously, !V indicated that V° is stable
in contact with UF , dissolved in this solvent.
Subsequent studies demonstrated that the analysis
of these materials was in error and that V° was not
nearly so stable as first reported. Additional
studies of this system in the NoF-LiF-KF mixture,
as well as in NaF-ZrF, (50-50 mole %), at 600
and at 800°C were made recently. Also, a brief
study of the reduction of UF , by tungsten metal in
the reaction medium NaF-Zrl'! (53-47 mole %) was
made in order to compare tli'ne behavior in this
solvent with that found earlier12 in the NaF-LiF-
KF mixture.

The results of the recent studies of the reduction
of UF, by V° at 600 and at 800°C in the two
different reaction mediums are presented in
Table 2.2.8. All runs were performed with 2 g of
V° added to the solvent in nickel equipment. In
the runs with the NaF-ZrF, mixture, 4.1 mole %
UF, (11.4 wt %) was present, and, in the runs
with the NaF-LiF-KF mixture, 2.3 mole % UF,
(15 wt %) was used. The studies of tungsten
were performed in a similar manner, with 4.0
mole % UF‘ (11.4 wt %) present in NaF-ZrF,
(53-47 mcle %). The results of the runs with
tungsten are given in Table 2.2.9.

The data given in Table 2.2.8 show that V°
is not stable in contact with UF, dissolved in
either type of fluoride mixture at 60?) or at 800°C.
There is some indication that higher equilibrium
vanadium concentrations exist in the NaF-ZrF
mixture at 800°C, but, in view of the relatively
few runs with the NaF-LiF-KF mixture and the
difference in the UF , concentrations, the data do
not show conclusively that V® is more reactive in
the NaF-ZrF, mixture than in the NaF-LiF-KF
mixture. The extensive attock of vanadium by
UF, in these fluoride mixtures indicates that the
use of vanadium alloys to contain these mixtures
would offer no real advantage. '

The results given in Table 2.2.9 show that low
equilibrium tungsten concentrations occur under
these conditions and demonstrate that W is stable
with respect to UF, dissolved in the NaF-ZrF,
mixture, These results are in marked contrast to
those found earlier with the NaF-LiF-KF mixture
as the reaction medium. Tungsten concentrations
of 1100 and 1400 ppm at 600 and ot 800°C, re-

spectively, were found in this medium.

 demonstrated that Cr*** is stable in this melt

probably disproportionated according to the reaction
3CrF, :_2CrF3 + C°,

Additional studies have now been made of this
system in a further attempt to determine the
equilibrium concentrations and for comparison with
results obtained when CrF, and Cr° are equi-
librated. The results are inclauded in Table 2.2.10.

Ifsthe Cr** values are ignored and only the total
chromium concentrations found in the filtrates are
considered, nearly constant values for the Cr**-to-
Cr*** ratic may be calculated. Such treatment
shows that about 60% of the chromium is present as
Cr** ond about 40% as Cr*** in all cases,
irrespective of whether CrF, or a mixture of CrF,
and Cr® was initially present. The concentration
equilibrium constants calculated from the mole
fractions of CrF, and CrF, present are not
constant, however, if this constant Cr¥**to-Crt*
ratio is used. They decrease from a value of
approximately 50 for the lowest total chromium
concentration to about 10 for the highest. These

126

vaolues are much greater than the 10—3 obtained
for the equilibrium constant by using the values
available for the standard free energy of formation
of CrF,and CrF, at 800°C. No reasonable balance
of Cr**, Cr***, and total chromium can be obtained
by using the experimentally determined valuves for
Cr**, and it thus appears that the experimental
values are probably inaccurate.

REDUCTION OF FeF, BY C° IN RbF-ZrF,
Jo Dc Redman

Data presented previously 'S for the reaction
FeF, + Cro=—CrF, + Fe®

in NaF-ZrF 4 (53-47 mole %) at 600°C showed that
the reduction of FeF, by Cr® was essentially
complete at the FeF, concentrations employed,
and, as a result, no reliable values for the CrF -
to-FeF, ratio (or K.) could be calculated. A
calculation of the CrF,.to-FeF, ratio from the
values found for K_ for the reaction

M + 2UF —MF, + 2UF, ,

where M is Cr or Fe, yielded o value of approxi-
mately 60 at 600°C with NaF-ZrF, (53-47 mole %)
as the reaction medium. This value is much larger
than the 6 x 10=3 obtained by calculating the
equilibrium constant from the values given for the
standard free energy of formation for CrF, and
FeF, at 600°C and shows that the system is far
from ideal.

A valuve of ~60 for the Crt*to-Fe** ratio was
found in the NaF-ZrF ; mixture at the highest FeF,
concentration (1.0 wt %) used in the previous
studies. Additional experiments have been per-
formed with higher l'-'eF2 concentrations to de-
termine whether the value for the Cr*‘-to-Fe**
ratio would increase with increasing FeF, ad-
ditions. Extremely erratic results were obtained
with 1.5 wt % FeF,. It appears probable that the
solubility of Cr** was exceeded and that the
presence of a solid phase consisting of a ternary
compound of NaF, ZrF , and CrF, was responsible
for the inconsistent results. |f this assumption is
correct, reliable values at the higher FeF, concen-
trations cannot be determined in this reactien
medium.

A study of this reaction was. also made with
RbF-ZrF , (52-48 mole %) as the reaction medium,
This medium sheuld yield a value of about 2 to
3 for the Crt*to-Fe** ratio, based on the data
available for the reduction of UF, by Cr° and Fe?,
and therefore be more adaptable to the experimental
determination of the Crt*-to-Fe** ratio. Blanks
were run in which 2 g of iron wire was hydrogen-
fired at 1000°C in a nicke! charge bottle; approxi-
mately 40 g of the RbF-ZrF, mixture and 2 g of
pure chromium were added; ond the system was
equilibrated at 600°C for 5 hr prior to filtration.
The experimental runs were made in a similar
manner, and the desired quantity of FeF, was
added. Data are reported in Table 2.2.11 fzor the
blanks and for the runs in which FeF, was added.

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER. 30, 1957

The iron concentrations present in the blanks
approximate those found in the NaF-ZrF, mixture
and in the charge material. This agreement
suggests that the iron is present as metal suf-
ficiently fine to pass the filter rather than os
dissolved Fe**. The data show that the reduction
of Fe**is essentially complete at all Fe** concen-
trations studied. The low iron concentrations
present in these runs preclude any accurate
evaluation of the Cr**to-Fe** ratio, but it is
evident that this ratio is much larger than the
value of 2 to 3 calculated from the data available
for the reduction of UF by Cr®and Fe®. In contrast
to the good agreement between the experimentally
determined and the calculated chromium concen-
trations found in the NaF-ZrF, mixture, the data

given in Table 2.2.11 show that in RbF-ZrF,
the calculated chromium concentrations are lower
than the experimentally determined concentrations.
This difference is approximately 20% for an initial
Fe** concentration in the range of 2000 to 6000
ppm. No satisfactory explanation can be given for
the large Cr**-to-Fe** ratic or for the difference
between the calculated and the experimentally
determined chromium concentrations. Additional

experimental work is planned in an attempt to -

resolve these discrepancies.

ously. The data obtained at 600°C demcnstrated
that the solubilities of CrF, and of FeF., are
functions of the excess of structural metal fluoride
present,  The solubility of NiF, showed this
behavior in the NoF-ZrF, and LlF-ZrF mixtures
but not-in the KF-ZrF, m:xture. The change in
solubility at 600°C is due to the presence of a
solid phase consisting of a ternary compound
containing more ZrF, than alkali fluoride and the
resulting enrichment of the liquid phase with
respect to alkali fluoride.

More recently the solubility of the three structural
metal fluorides has been studied at 600 and ot
800°C with RbF-ZrF, (5248 mole %) as the
solvent. The results are presented in Table 2.2.12,
and the 600°C values are plotted on Fig. 2.2.4,

along with data for the other solvents. As may be
seen in Fig. 2.2.4, the solubility at 600°C of all
the metal fluorides studied in the four solvents
increases ‘with increasing additions of the metal
fluoride, except in the case of NiF2 in the KF-
ZrF , mixture. In the case of FeF, the solubilities
in the different solvents for @ 5 wt % addition of
Fe** increase in the order Li, Na, K, and Rb,
with o total increase of about 50%. For a 1 wt %
addition of Fe** the order is different, and the
solubility in KF-ZrF  is a factor of 3 higher than
the solubility in NaF-ZrF,. The solubilities
found for CrF, in the NoF-, LiF-, and RbF-ZrF,
mixtures do not differ greatly, but the solubilities
found for CrF, in the KF-ZrF, mixture are con-
siderably higher. A comparison of the solubilities
at 800°C is not presented, mainly because the
FeF, and CrF, solubilities are so high. For
example, as ‘may be seen in Table 2.2.12,
solubility of approximately 16 wt % of Cr was
found for @ 20 wt % addition of Cr**, In the case
of NiF, the solubilities found in the NaF-, KF-,
and RbF-Z¢F , mixtures at 800°C range from 1.1 to
1.5 wt % Ni ** for 5 wt % additions of Ni**, whereas
the solubility is about 2.2 wt % in the LiF-ZrF
mixture. The difference is considerably less for a
1.5 wt % addition. ,
The results obtained from the runs in which
either CrF, or FeF; was equilibrated in the RbF-
ZrF, mixture show that both Cr*** and Fet*t
are partially reduced to Cr** or Fe** by the nickel
container. In virtually all cases no balance
between the Ni** found in the filtrate and the
quantity of divalent metal ion present was ob-
tained. This is, undoubtedly, due to the limited

130

solubility of Ni**. The presence of Cr** or Fe*?
represses the solubility of Ni**, and, as a result,
the solubility of Ni** in these runs is considerably
less than that reported for Ni** in Table 2.2.12,
where only Ni** was present.

ACTIVITIES IN ALLOYS

important factors that will influence the corresion
behavior of the new nickel-molybdenum alloys that
are being developed to contain molten fluoride
salts are the activities of the metallic. constituents
of the alloys. Ideally, it would be desirable to
know the activity of each constituent metal in the
alloy as a function of temperature and alloy compo-
sition. If, in addition, the thermodynamic properties
of the molten salts were known, it should be
possible to predict the corrosion behavior of the
molten salt—-alloy system. Data are now being
obtained relative to the activities of the con-
stituents of Cr-Ni-Mo alloys.

Panish!8 has studied the activity of Cr in the
Cr-Ni system ot 750 and at 965°C, and studies of
the activity of Ni® in Ni-Mo alloys have been
initiated. The cells being studied are of the type

Ni |NiCl, [Ni (alloy)
where the NiCl, is dissolved at a concentration of

0.5 mole % in f\laCI-KCI eutectic. The first goal
is to demonstrate the feasibility of activity

measurements of the Ni<Mo alloys by the emf
method. The side reaction

NiCl, + Mo®==MoCl, + Ni°

appears to have a negligible influence, since
NiCl, is more stable by about 12 keel per gram-
atom of chlorine than is MoCl,. However, the
diffusion of Ni in Ni-Mo alloys may not be rapid
enough to prevent nonequilibrium surface con-
ditions on the alloy electrode. .

Preliminary experiments have been run, but no
relicble or reproducible data have yet been ob-
tained. Operation of the cells has been complicated
by the existence of a large temperature gradient
(about 15°C) along the electrode. Methods of
eliminating this gradient are now being tested.
Further, the time and temperature required to
produce a fully annealed alloy electrode are not
yet known.

used for all experiments, and electrical conductivity
between the half-cells is attained with ZrO
bridges previously impregnated with the solvent.
The results obtained with iron and nickel couples

but with the liquid-junction emf’s neglected, are

listed in Table 2.2.13. The results are in accord

with previously reported values,!? and aill the
results lead to a value of (6 + 1) x 102 for the
ratio of the activity coefficients of NiF, and
FeF, in NaF-ZrF, (53-47 mole %) ot 650°C. If
the activity coefficient for FeF, is taken to be
3 (ref 20), the activity coefficient of NiF,, as
found from emf measurements, is (1.8 £ 0.3) x 103,
based on the solid as the standard state,

Results obtained for CreNi couples in NaF-ZrF,
at 650°C are presented in Table 2.2.14. All the
nickel half-cells were contained in nickel crucibles,
but various vessels were used for the chromium
half-cells.

When graphite, copper, or HfO, crucibles were
employed, the emf’'s were found to decrease rapidly
with time, and, if the initial potentials were used,
activity ratios of 50 to 300 could be calculated.
These results indicate that the choice of a con-
tainer material for CrF, melts is important. The
possibility that the inconclusive results were due
to the presence of Cr***, as well as Cr**, cannot
be completely ruled out. Further measurements
with chromium-plated nickel crucibles may resolve
this problem. It should be mentioned that ex-
aminations of the melts contained in Morganite
with the petrographic microscope revealed the
presence in the melts of some aluminum compound
other than A|20 . The melt in the boron nitride
vessel undoubtealy contained 8203 in sufficient
amounts to affect the measurements.

Emf Measurements of Chloride Melts

As discussed previously,21an emf study is being
contemplated of the effects of various compositions
of the solvent LiCI-ThCl, on a suitable solute in
dilute concentration. Although AgCl would be
useful as an index solute because of the good
repreducibility of the silver electrode, the acidity
of AgCl, as predicted by the ratio of its ionic
charge to its radius, is greater than that of LiCl.
Thus the activity coefficient of AgCl should
decrease continuously with increasing mole fraction
of ThCl ;. In order to obtain an activity coefficient
effect that will exhibit a predicted maximum when
plotted against the concentration of ThCl,, a
solute with an acidity intermediate between that
of LiCl and ThCl, will be necessary. The solute
NiCl, satisfies thls requirement, and the nickel
electrode is reproducible. However, the standard
free energy of formation of NiCl, ond thus its
standard potential for the temperature range in
question (about 700°C) are unknown. In order to
determine E °for NiCl,, the emf of the cell

Ni |NiCl (1) |CI,

 

2l E, Topol, op. cit., p 150,

132

or the cell
Ni | NiCl (sat), alkali chleride |Cl,

must be measurable at the desired temperature.
The first cell given above could not be used
becquse of the sublimation pressure of NiCl..
However, there was a possibility that saturated
solutions of NiCl, in KCI (or NaCl) could exist ot
700°C, as in the case of FeCl, (ref 22).
Accordingly, cooling curves were obtained
for various alkali chloride~NiCl, mixtures. The
mixtures were contained in platinum crucibles in
a helivm atmosphere, and the temperature effects
were measured with a Pt, Pt-=10% Rh thermocouple
that was dipped directly intc the melt. In the
KCI-NiCl, system there appeared to be an in-
congruentfy melting compound at 730°C for high
N|C| composmons, and thus there is apparently
no llquld phase in equilibrium with NiCl, below
730°C. Samples from the L|C|-N|C| cnd NaoCl-
NiCl, systems contained solid solutlons, which
ellmlnated these systems from consideration. Since
there was the prospect that CsCl and RbCl would

form very stable compounds with NiCl, and thus
provide NiCl, equilibria only at high temperatures,
these systems were not studied, and the use of an
NiCl, cell was abandoned.

Another solute that could conceivably meet the
requirements is PbCl,. Lead chloride melts at
501°C, and its standard potential can be measured
directly. A lead electrode requires that provision
be made for containing the lead in the molten
state at temperatures above 327°C; and thus the
electrode, which has the advantage of being strain-
free, consists of a pool of lead contained in o
quartz cup. Electrical contact is made with a
10-mil tungsten lead insulated from the melt by a
1-mm quartz tube.

The cell |
Pb(!) | PbCl (1) | CI ,{graphite)

was used to determme E®° for PbCIz.- Granular

lead was heated slowly in a vacuum to remove gas

and moisture; the lead chloride was treated
similarly. A graphite tube was preconditioned for
use as the Cl, electrode by heating in Cl
1000°C for several hours. The cell voltages
obtained in the early trials, although close to the
predicted values, were found to decrease slowly
with time. For one trial the PbCl, was treated
with HCl (Mathieson) and fused in pyrex; this
gave a salt which was gray in color instead of
white.  Another sample of PbCl, was treated
similarly with HCl produced by tﬁe reaction of
H,SO, on NaCi. The PbCi, agcin appeared
gray|s11, presumably because o? the presence of
organic matter in the salt. This same product was
then fused under chlorine. Upon solidification, a

fairly clear, white product resulted. The ‘salt was
“removed from its container in a'dry box and ground -
into small chunks for use in a-cell. Flakes of

lead ‘were preﬁielted in a Vycor crucible under

—helium. Since attempts to clean the surface of the
lead "by reduction with H, were unsuccessful,

clean metal from below the surface was. pipetted

‘into the electrode holders. A cell with such

purified materials gave potentials within a few
millivolts of the theoret;cal values and ‘maintained

reprodumb:llty ‘within' 1 mv. for two days. The =
experiment - was concluded when the tungsten'

lead-wire broke at the end of the second day.

The measured emf’s corrected for thermoelectric

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 1957

potentials are given in Table 2.2.15, along with
the literature values of E° (ref 23).

In order to ascertain the solvent composition

~ limits at 700°C, cooling curves were run on various

LiCl-ThCl, samples. Vacuum-tight fused-silica
tubes were used as containers for the thermocouples
in the initial experiments, but the heat effects were
so small that they could not be detected even with
a Pt, Pt-Rh differential thermocouple and a sensi-
tive amplifier. In order to measure the small heat
effects, the Pt, Pt-Rh thermocouples were inserted
directly into the melts, which were contained in
platinum crucibles in a helium-atmosphere furnace.
The temperature measurements were calibrated
against the melting points of pure NaCl and pure

LiCl oand found to be low by 11°C for both salts.

All the temperature measurements were therefore
increased by 11°C. The phase diagram of the
system was not completed, but the following
important features were observed. The liquidus
temperature drops from 613°C for pure LiCl to

- 560°C for a eutectic containing 20 mole % ThCl .

A compound that appears to be 2LiCl.ThCl, melts
at about 720°C, and a second eutectic occurs at
670°C that contains 37 mole % ThCl,. A second
compound, LiCl 3ThC| melts at some fairly
high temperature, that is, 900°C or higher. The
melting point of ThCl, is 820°C. Thus the LiCl-
ThCI4 solvent is liquid at 700°C for compositions
with 0 to 29 mole % ThCl‘ and 36 to 39 mole %
ThCi .

SOLUBILITY OF HELIUM, ARGON, AND XENON
GASES IN NoF-ZrF‘-

N. V. Smith

Determinations were made of the solubilities of
argon and of xenon gases in molten NaF-ZrF,
(53-47 mole %)as functions of pressure and temper-
ature. The experimental procedures and assemblies
were the same as those used previously24 for
determining the solubilities of helium and of
xenon in molten NaF-ZrF .UF, (50-46-4 mole %)
and of helium in NaF-ZrF, (53-47 mole %). The
results obtained for argon and xenon are summarized
in Tables 2.2.16 and 2.2.17, respectively. The
data continue to show that in this solvent (1) the
solubilities of the gases follow Henry's law,
(2) the solubilities increase with increasing
temperature, and (3) the solubilities decrease with

increasing atomic weight of the gas. The tabulated

~ results for argon appear to be consistent to within

better than 5%, but, based on possible experimental
uncerfainties, the over-all accuracy of the measure-
ments will be assumed to be 110%.

The numerical consistency of the xenon data
appears to be of the same order of magnitude as
that assumed for the argon data. Additional ex-
experimental uncertcinties were introduced, how-
ever, by the need for recovering the xenon. The
initial purity of the xenon was 99.9+%, and after
seven experiments the purity had decreased to
72%. Because of the limited amount of xenon
available, the saturating gas was sampled only
at the start and at the end of the series of experi-
ments. Since no mishap occurred with the xenon
recovery system in any of the experiments, it was
assumed that the xenon was uniformly contaminated
to the extent of 4% per experiment, and the partial
pressure of xenon was estimated from the total
pressure by making the corresponding correction.
Numerically, the estimoted corrections amount to

the result of a leak to the atmosphere in one of the

gas cylinders in which the xenon was periodically

frozen. These cylinders were the only portions of

have been complled 'in Table 2.2 18 for com-

parison. - - The temperature dependence of these

on which the heats of solution determined from the
slopes of the lines are also presented.

The values of the enthalpy and entropy changes

2.2.19. |t may be noted that the heats of solution
increase with increasing atomic weight of the gas.
Furthermore, the entropies of solution in each case
are quite small (less than 2 eu). Similar behavior
was exhibited by helium and xenon in the related

solvent NaF-ZrF -UF , (50-46-4 mole %), as shown

in Table 2.2.20.

Since it is possible that the uncertainties in the
determination of AH and of AS may be as large as
1 kcal and 11 eu, respectively, it appears that
there ore no significant differences in the values

‘in Table 2.2.20 that may be attributed to differ-

ences in the solvents used. ~ The possible
significance of the small numerical magnitudes of
the entropies of solution has been studied. From

-a practical point of view, as has been indicated by

Blander,25 the small value of the entropy means

‘that the temperature dependence of the solubility

can be predicted fairly accurately from a single

measurement and a simple calculation of the
- entropy change undergone by an ideal gas in

isothermal expansion. Additional suggestions23
point out the possibility that the free volume of
the gas in solution is o large fraction of the total

 volume, as has been observed in other solutions

of rare gases.

SOLUBILITY OF HF IN NaF-ZrF, MIXTURES
J. H. Shaffer /

Studies of the solubility of HF gas in NaF-ZtF
were continued in order to determine the effect of '
solvent composition on the solubility. The
solubilities in solvents containing 35, 40, and
47 mole % ZrF , have been determined, and experi-
ments with so1vents containing 20, 55, 60, ond
65 mole % ZrF , are under way. The experimental
results are summarized in Tables 2.2.21 and
2.2.22. The values of the heats and entropies of
solution for HF in the different solvents are given
in Table 2.2.23.

The data indicate that HF gas follows Henry's
law within the precision of the measurements
throughout the composition range studied; the
solubility of HF decreases with increasing temper-
ature; and the solubility of HF increases with
increasing NaF concentration. In addition, the
calculated results indicate that the solution of
HF in these solvents is an exothermic process
which liberates more heat as the concentration
of NaF is increased. The entropy of solution
changes from -5.2 to —6.2 eu with an increase of
7 mole % NaF. Such losses of entropy are probably
primarily rotational losses in the dissolved HF
as compared with gaseous HF. Preliminary results
of studies of the solubility of HF in the NaF-KF-
LiF eutectic, as reported in the following section,
indicate @ AH and AS of solution of about —-17
kcal/mole and =10 eu, respectively. These values
do not appear to be out of line when they are

Both sets of data in Table 2.2.24 yield a straight
line when plotted vs the reciprocal of the absolute
temperature. Because of the close agreement of
the two sets of data, each representing an inde-
pendent set of experiments, it is highly probable
that the true values will not differ by an appreci-
able amount from these tentative values., A
comparison of the data with those presented pre-
viously for the NaF-ZrF, (53-47 mole %) system
reveals that the corresponding HF solubilities in
NaF-KF-LiF are roughly 50 times those for the
NaF-ZrF , system.

These preliminory studies have demonstrated
that molten NaF-KF-LiF can be contained in
nickel reactors for long periods of time if the
mixtures are subjected to exhaustive purification.

for the feasibility of the solid-solvent extraction:

process are (1) limited solubilities of the rare-
earth fluorides in the solvent and (2) formation
of solid solutions by the saturating phases of the
solutes and the solid solvent., Previous measure-
ments of the solubilities of LaF, in the NaF-KF-
LiF ternary eutectic revealed that these solutes
are extremely soluble in this solvent {more than
20 wt % at 550°C). Accordingly, other methods
of removal of injurious rare earths must be found,
if satisfactory fuel reprocessing methods are
eventuclly to be developed for reactors that use
the NaF-KF-LiF fuel solvent. The possibility of
precipitating the rare earths as oxides was
therefore considered worthy of investigation. In
order to simplify graphical presentation of the
results, a eutectic mixture of KF-LiF was used
rather than the NaF-KF-LiF ternary eutectic.
It is believed that the chemical behavior of
solutes in these two solvents is very similar, if
not identical.

A systematic investigation of the solubilities
and relative stabilities of some monovalent,
divalent, trivalent, and quadrivalent oxides was
planned.  Simultanecusly, o study of different
possible methods of formation of the oxides in the
solution was scheduled. The particular oxides
proposed for study in the prelimincry phase of the
investigation were Li, O, BeO, Mg0O, CaO, SrO,
BaO, Ce,0,, La,0;, Sm,0, ZrO,, aond UO,.
The methods of oxnde formahon included for |nma|
study were reactions with: (1) carbonates,
(2) alkali hydroxides, and (3) oxides of less
stability.

The three methods of oxide formation have been
studied, and some experimental inconveniences
and advantages inherent in each method have
been observed. The addition of a carbonate such
as K 2CO; to the solvent in order to form and
prec:pltate some insoluble oxide sounded very
attractive. However, it was found in two experi-
ments that the carbonate does not decompose
appreciably unless the system is heated to temper-
atures above 1100°C. The second method studied
was the addition of LiOH to the solvent in order
to form and precipitate an insoluble oxide. This
method was found to be quite effective in the
precipitation of cerium from the solution. One
objectionable feature is the rapid liberation of
steam, which can cause the solution to spill over
unless special precautions are taken. The third
method consists of the addition of a less stable

140

oxide in order to form and precipitate an oxide of
higher stability. This method has been found to
be quite satisfactory to precipitate cerium by using
calcium oxide.

No numerical values of solubilities of oxides
have yet been obtained, but some useful quanti-
tative information has been gathered regarding the

solubilities of Li,0, Ce, O, and CeF,. It has
been found that at 550°C the solubility of Li,0
in KF-LiF (50-50 mole %) is greater than 1.6 wt %;
the solubility of Ce 0 at 600, 700, and 800°C
is less than 0.1 wt %, ond at 600°C the solublllty
of CeF, is greater than 8.2%.

An indication of the relative stabilities of some
oxides may be obtained by comparison of some of
the calculated free energy changes for the for-
mation of the oxide from the fluoride. The
calculated values may also be compared with the
degree of completion of the reaction as measured

experimentally by determining the concentration

of cerium remaining in the liquid after a reasonable
amount of time has elapsed after the addition of
the particular oxide to the solution containing
CeF,. Since the melting point of the oxide may
also be a good indication of its stability ond
relative solubility, the melting temperatures are
also included in the comparisons shown in
Table 2.2.25.

Since the values for the free energies of for-
mation of rare earth fluorides may be quite
unreliable, it is not expected that quantitative
correlations can be made from the AF° values
presented in Table 2.2,25. These values may,
however, be helpful in interpolation between
experiments. For example, Li,O has been shown
to react to completion with Ce%: g+ and the values
of AF and the melting points Ilsted for Na,,0 and
for K,O indicate that 100% completion is expected
of these two reagents for the corresponding
reaction.

Present plans call for the determination of the
solubility of BaO and its extent of reaction with
CeF, before a study of tetravalent oxide solu-
bilities and relative stabilities with respect to
trivalent oxides is undertaken. If sufficient
differences are noted, the possibilities2? of
effecting separation of tetravalent oxides from
trivalent oxides will be seriously considered.

STABILITY OF UO,F, IN FUSED SALTS
Ro Jo She“

In connection with a possible method of
reprocessing fused salt reactor fuels by the
precipitation of the oxides of some of the fission
products, experiments were conducted to investigate
the stability of UO ,Fy ina fused salt mixture.

Crystalline UO_F was ‘mixed with @& purified-

mixture of NaF-BeF, (57-43 mole %) in a platinum

crucible to give a 'I mole % concentration of the _
~ uranium compound and then heated in an inert
- atmosphere in the visual-thermal apparatus. There

was no visible change in the mixture until liquid
appeared, at approximately 330°C. All the UOF,

“particles had disappeared at 400°C, and the melt |
had a light rust color which became darker when °
- the :temperature ‘was increased to the maximum of
 480°C.. Gas ‘bubbles were .observed on the walls -
~of the  platinum crucible. Upon~ “cooling, " the
sohdlfled ‘mixture had a -pinkish-brown calor, -

while a similor mixture given the same treatment
in a nickel crucible was gray-white in appearance
and there was a black deposit that adhered to the

surface of the crucible that had been in contact
with the melt. X-ray diffraction examination of
the deposit indicated that it was largely U,0,.
Ground samples of the fused materials were found
to contain UO2 or U308 when examined by means
of the petrographic microscope. Chemical analyses
of the melts are presented in Table 2.2.26.

A portion of the mixture fused in platinum was

transferred to nickel filtration - apparatus and

filtered at 470°C. The filtrate contained 0.44 wt %
U, and the residue cpr_ﬂained 5.80 wt % U. The

theoretical uranium concentration of the mixture
was 5.10 wt % U if calculated os UO,F, and
5.83 wt % U if calculated as UD,. The uranium
compound in both samples was identified as either
UO, or U, 0, by microscopic examination. The
concentration was too low for positive identificafion
by means of x-ray diffraction. It oppears from
these observations that nickel will readily reduce
UO,F, in a fused salt medium by the reactions:

UOF, + Ni—> U0, + NiF,
or

4UOF, + 2Ni—> U,0, + 2NiF, + UF,

It seemed evident also that UO_F, is more
stable in contact with platinum, as might be
expected, - but that a portion of the compound
present was reduced by some means or underwent
thermal decomposition. In order to investigate
the likelihood of thermal decomposition, a portion
of the UO,F, was heated alone in an inert atmos-
phere in the visuval-thermal apparatus with o
platinum crucible as the container. When the
temperature was increased to 120°C, a large
thermal effect was noted, and the exposed surface
of the material gradually darkened. The temper-
ature was further increased to the maximum temper-
ature of 470°C, and the sample was then allowed
to cool to room temperature, placed in a tared
screw-cap bottle, and weighed immediately after
removal from the inert atmosphere box. The
compound had lost 0.4% in weight, and it was
quite hygroscopic. It gained about 1.1% in weight

after standing in the screw-capped bottle for

10 days. The analyses of the material before and
after heat treatment are given in Table 2.2.27.

The exact nature of the chemical change in the
UO,F, used in these experiments is not clear,

but it seems obvious that hydrolysis did not
occur, because the fluorine content did not change
on heating. It has been reported39 that hydrated
uranyl fluoride can be dehydrated at 120°C without
serious decomposition and also that uranyl fluoride
formed at low temperatures is very hygroscopic.3!
This experiment seems to confirm both obser-
vations, except that the observed weight loss was
much less than would be expected from the reported
water content of the starting material.

OXIDATION OF MIXTURES COMPOSED OF
SODIUM AND POTASSIUM

E. E. Ketchen

The results of some preliminary studies of the
oxidation of a sodium-potassium mixture at room
temperature were reported previously.32  The
data indicated that a sodium-to-potassium ratio
of about 22 was obtained in the oxides formed by
the oxidation of a mixture of 50.4 wt % sodium
with 49.6 wt % potassium. Additional experiments
have shown, however, that the values obtained
were probably inaccurate and that the precise
results were due either to a very careful repro-
duction of experimental conditions or, more
probably, pure chance. ‘

The apparatus used in the recent studies is a
modification of the glass apparatus described
previously.32 The upper portion of the apparatus
was enlarged to a diameter of 2% in. to eliminate
the need for shaking the mixture during the
oxidation. The oxidation and filtration are per-
formed in the dry box in order to reduce the amount
of contamination by water ond the resulting
hydroxide formation. At present, three capsules
are loaded in the dry box, and each is oxidized
by intreducing dry air at a pressure of 1.5 to 2 cm
of Hg, evacuating, and repeating this cycle wuntil
four portions of air have been used. Filtration is
achieved by applying helium pressure to the upper
portion of the apparatus, forcing the alkali metals
through the glass filter disk, and leaving the
oxides with a small amount of metal in the upper
chamber. The residual alkali metals are removed

from the oxides by mercury according to the
procedure described previously.  The results
obtained by using this method for the room-temper-
ature oxidation of two different sodium-potassium
mixtures are given in Table 2.2.28.

The lack of preciseness of the results suggests
that it is extremely difficult to control all the
variables which offect the oxidation process.
Traces of moisture should tend to reduce the
sodium-to-potassium ratio, and consequently the

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 1957

larger ratios are probably closest to the correct
valve. It may be noted that the values given in
Table 2.2.28 that were obtained for the 51 wt %
Na~49 wt % K mixture are significantly larger than
the value of 22 obtained previously. The lack of
precision in the results makes it difficult to
ascertain the effect of composition of the alkali
metal mixture on the sodium-to-potassium ratio in
the oxides, although it appears that the ratio de-
creases with increasing potassium concentration.

An appreciable difference in properties between
analogous compounds of zirconium and hafnium
can be of considerable importance in the separa-
tion of the two elements. Therefore the sublima-

tion pressures of HfF, were determined, by using

the Rodebush-Dixon method,! for comparison with
the known sublimation pressure of ZrF, (ref 2).
The data obtained, as plotted in Fig. 2.3.1 and
given in Table 2.3.1, fit the equation

As may be seen from Fig. 2.3.1, the sublimation
pressure of ZrF , is approximately three times that
of HfF, at o given temperature. This factor of

for separating zirconium from hafium in a high-
temperature (above 925°C) process. It also might
be useful in the production of ZrF, from a starting
mixture of zirconium and hafnium oxides. The
oxides would be hydrofluorinated and ZrF, would
be separated by heating ond preferential subliming.

An early determination of the vapor pressures of
BeF, was reported by Moore, but the scatter in
the measurements was larger thon is now expected
with improved techniques. Therefore new meas-
urements were made by using the Rodebush-Dixon
method. The values obtained, as given in Table
2.3.2, fit the equation

The vapor pressures of BeF, in the range 800 to

1025°C have also been measured by Sense et al, %>
by using the carrier gas method and assuming that
the vapor species was monomeric. Their most
recent results? are in very good agreement with the
data given in Table 23.2. Comparisons of three
quantities derived from the vapor pressures are
presented in Table 2.3.3,

The agreement between the values obtained by

the direct and the carrier-gas measurements indi-

cates that BeF, vapor is monomeric, Accordingly
it should be possible to measure activities from
vapor pressures over BeF,-rich solutions, where
the vapor could be proved to be predominantly
BeF,. A svitable system for an investigation of
this type is LiF-BeF ..

2.4. PRODUCTION OF PURIFIED MIXTURES

PREPARATION OF VARIOUS
SPECIAL FLUORIDES

B. J. Sturm
Preparation of YF,

The amount of YF, required by the ORNL Metal-
lurgy Division in the experimental production of
ytrium metal has continved to increase. Plans
are being considered for changing the method of
preparing YF; from the wet process to the direct
hydrofluorination of Y,0, in order to meet the
increasing demands.

Approximately 6000 g of YF, was prepared by
dissolving Y,0, in aqueous HCI solution, filter-
ing, precipitating the fluoride by the addition of
aqueous HF (48%), washing by decantation, re-
covering the solid by centrifugation, and drying at
150°C. The partially dried material was given the
standard hydrogen=hydrogen fluoride treatment
following the addition of the desired quantities of
MgF, and LiF. Approximately 8000 g of the
processed YF,;-MgF,-LiF mixture was unioaded
from the receivers, crushed to a suitable size, and
loaded into charging vessels supplied by the
Metaliurgy Division.

Preparation of Other Fluorides

Approximately 5 Ib of CrF, was prepared by
treating hydrated chromic fluoride with NH,F.-HF
and decomposing the resulting (NH,),CrF, at
450°C. Most of the CrF; was converted to CrF,
by hydrogen reduction at 700 to 800°C. A silver
reactor was used in a recent hydrogen reduction
run, but the resulting CrF, has not been analyzed.
The complete dissolution of CrF, frequently is

G. J. Nessle

L. G. Overholser

difficult to obtain, and, as a result, the analytical
values are not as reliable as desired. A suitable
flux that will not oxidize CrF, but will render it
more readily soluble is being sought. One run, in
which equimolar quantities of ZrF, and CrF,
were fused at 900°C in a sealed capsule, yielded
a product that was readily soluble. ' Additional
work is necessary before the stability of GF, in
this medium can be established.

A small batch of VF, was prepared by con-
densing HF on ¢ V,0, powder, heating to remove
the water and excess HF, and then hydrofluorinat-

ing at 200°C.

Dispensing and Servicing Opgidﬁqns
F. A. Doss D. C. Wood

During the quarter, 100 filling and draining op-
erations were performed that involved 785 kg of
liquid metals and 1229 kg of salts. The 1229 kg
of salts was made up of 419 kg of new material
and 810 kg of salvaged material. The salvaged
material is being used in testing of the fluoride-
volatility process for the recovery of uranium.
This salvaged material is not included in the mo-
terial balance given in the following section.

A series of experiments for determining the
amount of fuel which will be held up on various
internal surfaces of the ART was initiated. The
surfaces to be studied are various sizes of tubing
held at various angles to the horizontal, machined
flat plates held at various angles to the horizontal,
a section of the heat-exchanger tube-to-header
junction, a mockup of a tube bundle, a 3-in.-dia
bellows, and various right-angle welded joints.
The pieces being studied are appropriately sup-
ported in a small flange-top receiver, the receiver
is filled to immerse the piece in NaF-ZrF ,-UF,
(56-39-5 mole %, fuel 70) at 1500°C for 2 hr, the
temperature is allowed to drop to 1200°F (the

DETERMINATION OF TRACES OF NaK IN AIR
A. S. Meyer, Jr.  J. P. Young

Additional modifications were made in the optical

system of the instrument for the detection of NaK

in air by measurement of the absorption of sodium
resonance radiation by sodium atoms.! These
modifications, which were first discussed in
the previous report in this series,? include the
insertion of an additional light stop which is
designed to exclude the continuum radiation of
the heated furnace from the photomultiplier tube.
The continuum radiation caused a near-saturation
phenomenon with respect to the light seen by
the phototube and thereby severely reduced the
sensitivity of the instrument when the temperature
of the furnace exceeded 700°C.

It was suggested® that the light stop consist
of a plate with two small apertures approximately
0.08 in. in diometer. The aperture plate (shown
in Fig. 2.5.1) is placed in the focal plane of

sorption cells; the image is formed by the con-
densing lens. The two circular holes in this
plate correspond precisely to the images of the
end windows. With this arrangement, all radiation
except that from the heated quartz windows
is masked by the light stop. An additional
condensing lens is required to refocus the beams
on the photocell. The positions of both the
aperture plate and the small. condensing lens
can  be adjusted along the axis of the optical
system to provide sharp focusing. A multilayer
interference filter and several possible com-
binations of glass and gelatin color filters have
also been included to isolate more effectively
the resonance radiation at 589 my.

Since the openings in the added cperture plate
are relatively small, much more precise focusing
and alignment of the optical system are necessary
than were required for the original system. Ac-
cordingly, o base assembly is being fabricated
which provides for precise adjustments of the
positions of both the chopper and detector com-
ponents. The arrangement is designed according

provides for movement of the optical components
in any desired direction with a single degree of
freedom. All the components are mounted on -a
7-ft section of 18-in. channel iron, which serves
as a rigid optical bench. Each end of the channel
iron is -slotted to accommodate bushings which
locate the base plates for the chopper and detector
assemblies. These base plates can be moved
along the optical axis, for coarse focusing, or
can be rotated about a vertical axis. A second
plate is supported on each base plate by ball
bearings in opposing V.grooves. The second
plate is spring-loaded with respect to the base
plate and is driven by o screw-drive mechanism
to provide motion at right angles to the optical
axis of the system. The chopper and detector
sections are each supported by three vertically
adjustable - screws whose spherical ends rest
in radial V-grooves in the second plates. Ad-
justments of these screws can produce tilting
motions -in any desired direction with negligible
translational motion. Fabrication and gssembly of
the modified instrument are about 90% completed.

DETERMINATION OF OXYGEN IN
METALLIC LITHIUM

A. S. Meyer, Jr. 'R. E. Feathers

Further studies of the butyl iodide method for
the determination of oxygen in metallic lithium
have revealed that several unexpected reactions
occur during the dissolution of the sample in

"ethereal solutions of iodine and butyl iodide

and the subsequent extraction of the inorganic
compounds  into -aqueous. solutions for titration.

It was demonstrated that oxygen, “when present
‘as LiOH, cannot be. defermmed by this. method.
No ucud was consumed in the titration ‘of the .
‘aqueous extract of- the soluhon which was formed‘ :
“ by the reactlon of 500 mg of LiOH with the
ethereal reagents. The following reaction of ._L!OH
with iodine is proposed to explain the elimination

of the hydrox:de durlng the dissolution reaction:

L|0H + 1, -—>L|I + HOI

The hypo:odous acud is oo weak for tltrcmon cnd'

is probably decomposed to -water, iodine, and

oxygen in the nonaqueous medium. The similar - -

reaction which may occur with Li,0,

Li20 + I2~—-—>Li0| + Lil

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 1957

does not interfere with the determination of oxygen
as Li,0. In the titration with acid, the hypoiodite
consumes a quantity of acid which is equivalent
to that required to titrate the oxide from which
it is formed:

- - L4 '
oI + I~ + 2H 7——>I2+H2O

The butyl iodide method appears therefore to
be essentially specific for the determination of

. 'Li20' The elimination of the alkalinity of Li 3N

and Li,C, by reaction with iodine was dlscussed
prevuously. ~ Lithium carbonate is the only re-
maining alkaline constituent which might be
titrated. It is unlikely, however, that Li,CO,
will be present in sngnlflcant concentrahons m
samples which have been heated to elevated
temperatures, since it is not compatible with
metallic lithium.

A small negative bias has been observed in
determinations by the butyl iodide method that
is believed to be caused by traces of acid which
are liberated by the reaction

H20 + Iz-% HI + HIO

which occurs during the extraction of the ethereal
solution with water. The equilibrium constant
for this reaction has been reported® to be approxi-
mately 10~13,  On the basis of this constant,
less than one microequivalent of acid would be
liberated by this reaction under the conditions
of the titration. When ether is present as a third
phase, however, the equilibrium is displaced to
the right and hydrogen ions are liberated in

‘quantities - equivalent to 50 to 100 ppm for a
~1-g sample. The magnitude of this error is a
“function of the amount of excess iodine which

remains  after the dissolution of the sample and

_'fhe'refore 'is not easily corrected for by blank
~ determinations. The only explanation which has

been postulated for the increase in the hydrolysis

" reaction ‘is that hypoiodous acid is complexed

or preferenhally extracted to a high degree by

 ether.

The error can be eliminated by removing the

'free -iodine before the organic solution is ex-
“tracted with water. A distillation method for the

removal of the iodine and the ether was tested
and was found to be impractical. The iodine
was rapidly removed, however, by reduction with
finely divided silver or with mercury. Mercury
was found to be the more convenient reagent,
since an exfensive preparation procedure must
be carried out to obtain silver in o sufficiently
finely divided form for ropid reaction. The effec-
tiveness of this procedure in eliminating the
negative interference was demonstrated by titration

of reagent blanks end by carrying 500-1g sarnples,
of Li, O through -the procedure. - Approxlmutely-'
80% of the odded Li, 0 was titrated. . In view.
of the possible confumlnaﬂon with moisture during”

transfer of small quantities of Li,O, a recovery
of 80% was considered to be satisfactory.

in the presence of iodide, the excess silver
or mercury is oxidized rapidly by atmospheric
oxygen, These reactions,’ indicated in ‘the fol-
lowing equations, can consume hydrogen’ ions
during titration and introduce: posmve errors:

The positive - errors can. of course be - avoxded"

The errors can be eliminated more convemently,
however, by the addition of enhydrous HgCI
after the reduction of the iodine. The HgCI,
complexes the iodide according to the equcfion

217 + HgCl,—> Hgl, + 2Cl~

The extraction and titration are then, in effect,
carried out in a chloride system,

A proposed procedure based on the considerations
discussed above is now being tested on samples
of metallic lithium. The dissolution is carried
out in the opparatus shown in Fig. 2.5.2. With
the cooling jacket of the condenser drained and
an empty reaction vessel in position, the con-
denser is flushed by transferring 25 ml of anhy-
drous ether to the reaction flask. lodine {15 g)
and a magnetic stirring bar are transferred to
a second reaction vessel immediately after it
is removed from a drying oven, and, with a
positive pressure of helium in the condenser,
the reaction vessel containing the iodine is

purged with helium; ond a 100-ml wvolume of
n-butyl iodide, which is stored over activated
aluming, is transferred to the reaction vessel,
along with 100 ml of diethyl ether, which is
stored over metallic sodium. The solution is
then stirred until the iodine is mixed thoroughly.

The sample of 1 to 2 g of metallic_ lithium is
added through the condenser from a Jomesbury

“valve sampler.” The solution is heated at reflux
. temperatures and stirred until dissolution of the

metal is completed. An excess of iodine should

be evident at this time. A 10-ml aliquot of the

organic solution is withdrawn, and the con-
centration of iodide in the solution is determined
by titration with AgNO,.
sample is calculated from this titration. A
10-ml portion of mercury is then added, and the
solution is stirred until the color of the iodine

is discharged. - A 30-g quentity of anhydrous

HgCl, is added,” and the solution in the flask
is snrred for 5 min to permit complexing of the
iodide ion. The solution is transferred from the

flask to o separotory funnel and extracted with

recently boiled distilled water which has been

pretitrated to a pH of approximately 5. The
. aqueous extract is then 'ritroted with 0.01 or

There has, as yet, . been no opportunlty to test
this modification of the. procedure by analyzing

'hlghly purified samples of metallic lithium.

Excellent recovery was attained when a 0.5-mg

~sample of Li,O was added to a simulated sample

solution which was prepared from anhydrous
Lil, butyl iodide, ether, and iodine. As soon
as a sufficiently reproducible series of samples
is available the results of determinations by
this procedure will be compared with unolyses

ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

fluorination of the oxides with KBrF, was as-
sembled. This apparatus, which is adapted from

the work of Hoekstra and Katz,? is shown in

Fig. 2.5.3.

A detciled procedure was formulated and is

presently being given an initial test. Briefly,
the reagent, KBrF,, is formed by the addition
of BrF; to KF in the reaction tube. Sufficient

KBrF, is made to permit the andlysis of a number
of samples without. recharging the system with
fresh reagent for each determination. The reaction

tube is cooled to the temperature of liquid
nitrogen, and, with argon flowing into the tube,
the sample is quickly added to the tube, which
is then caopped. The temperature of the reactor

is then raised to operating temperatures, about -
400°C, so that the KBrF, can react quanmotlve!y‘
with the metallic oxides present and liberate oxy-

gen gas. This gas.is passed through @ series of

traps to remove bromine and excess recgent. "An *

automatic Toepler pump is used to transfer the
oxygen fto either of two pressure-measuring de-
vices - a mercury manometer or, if greater sen-
sitivity is desired, an oil manometer. .

Since the volume of the measuring system cannot

be obtained directly, the system must be calibrated

by carrying out the procedure with samples of

known oxygen content. Zirconium oxide has been

selected as a standard for calibration. On the

basis of estimated wvolumes of the measuring
system, quantities of oxygen as low as 5 pg

can be detected. The range of the apparatus caon
be extended upward by severdl orders of magnitude
by increasing the volume of the measuring system.

DETERMINATION OF NICKEL IN
METALLIC SODIUM

The method for the determination of nickel in
which the absorbance of its chelate complex with
4-isopropyl-1,2-cyclohexanedionedioxime in xy-
lene'® is measured was applied to -onalyses of
samples from studies which are being carried
out by the Metallurgy Division in order to deter-
mine the solubility of nickel in molten sodium.

The samples are prepared by heating metallic
sodium under an atmosphere of helium in a nickel
crucible which is contained in a welded Inconel
capsule. After the sample hds been maintained
at the desired temperature for a period sufficient
to establish equilibrium, the molten metal is
transferred to an opposing molybdenum bucket
by inverting the Inconel capsule. The sample
is submitted for analysis in the molybdenum

bucket.. The sample includes the contents of .

the bucket together with ‘any nickel deposrfed
on the inner walls of the bucket.

- Initial determinations were carried out by dis-
solving the metallic sodium in 50 m! of methanol.
An aliquot of the methanol solution was titrated
with standard acid to determine the sample weight.

The moiybdenum ‘bucket was -rinsed with warm

1:3 HCI, ond the washings were combined with

the methanol solution, which was acidified and -
‘evaporated toa volume of approximately 25 ml

to remove the methanol.

In the determinations, an unusual interference by
molybdenum, which was dissolved from the con-
tainer, -was experienced. It was found that molyb-

~denum -(an orange-colored extract) .interfered only
when methanol or some contaminant thereof was

present and when cyanide and Sulfi-Down, added

_as -masking agents, had been used. No colored

extract was observed when the chelating agent,
4-isopropyl-1,2-cyclohexanedionedioxime, was ab-
sent, and the interference appeared to be in-
tensified by the presence of nickel. Since the
interfering reactions appeared to be exceedingly
complex and could be eliminated by dissolving
the samples in water rather than in methanol,
the nature of the reactions has not yet been
studied in detail.

Because the outer walls of the molybdenum
bucket may be contaminated with nickel as a
result of contact with the Inconel capsule, it is
necessary to exclude from the sample the water
used for the washing of the outer surfaces of
the bucket. This requirement presented special
problems when the samples were dissolved in
water and required the design of the new ap-
paratys, fabricated from fiuorothene, which is
shown in Fig. 2.5.4. The apparatus is con-
structed by threading a modified ‘/2-ih. flared

. fluorothene fitting through the bottom of a 250-ml

FORMATION OF CARBIDES BY THE REACTION

OF PUMP LUBRICANTS AND NaK AT
ELEVATED TEMPERATURES

A. S. Meyer, Jr.  G. Goldberg

During the dissolution of alkali metdls and
alkali metal residues, an odor that is commonly
associated with acetylene has frequently been
detected. This phenomenon has been most pro-
nounced during the chemical examination of cold
traps by the method described previously,'!
When water was added to cold traps from NaK
systems after most of the residual alkali metals

had been converted to the halides by reacting
them with butyl bromide, an intense odor was
detected and minor explosions were experienced,
even though an attempt was made to maintain an
inert atmosphere within the system. The presence
of acetylene in the evolved gases was sub-
stantiated when precipitates of Ag,C, were formed
upon passage of the gases through solutions of
AgNO

Recenfly an explosion occurred when an ex-
perimental NaK system was opened after operation
had been terminated because of a leak in the
pump seals. In view of the well-known acetylene
explosion hazard, it was deemed necessary to
investigate the possibility that carbides had
formed as a result of a reaction between the
pump lubricant and the alkali metals, with the
subsequent liberation of acetylene.

In earlier tests of the compatibility of lubricants
with molten alkali metals,!? there was no ob-
servable reaction between the alkali metals and
the lubricants. The tests were carried out, how-
ever, to determine whether a reaction would occur
if alkali metals at 1400°F leaked into the {ubricant
at 400°F. The conditions of these tests did not
approximate, therefore, the temperatures which
would prevail during a leak of the pump oil into
the NaK being pumped.

In order to test for the formation of carbides,
the reaction was investigated in the apparatus
shown in Fig. 2.5.5. The reaction tube is «
section of 3/ -in.-OD, 0.065-in.-wall Inconel tubing,
which can be heated in a vertical tube furnace.
A thermocouple is spot-welded to the tubing.

approximately 600°C, at which time the pressure
increased abruptly to 450 psi. The gases were
later analyzed mass spectrographically and found
to consist primarily of methane, with a trace of
hydrogen. After the reaction tube had been main-
tained at a temperature of 650°C for 4 hr, it

carbides were found in a blank run in which the
test was repeated with only NoK added to the

The test is being repeated in order to obtain

tests with sodium are proposed.

DETERMINATION OF ALUMINUM IN MIXTURES
OF FLUORIDE SALTS

J. P. Young J.R. French

An investigation of a spectrophotometric method
for the determination of trace amounts of
aluminum' in mixtures of fluoride salts with
pyrocatechol violet was continued. The repro-
ducibility of the data was improved by washing
all glassware with ¢ dilute solution of pyrocatechol
violet prior to use and by the addition of thiogly-
colic acid to the test solutions. These modifi-
cations lowered the coefficient of variation of
the method to approximately 2%.

A study was made of interferences that would
normally be encountered in corrosion tests with
NaF-KF-LiF-UF, and the newly developed nickel-
molybdenum-base alloys. These alloys contain
trace amounts of iron plus a number of nonferrous
materials. Since pyrocatechol violet is a sensitive
reagent for iron, essentially complete removal of
iron is necessary before application of the reagent
in the determination of aluminum. Removal of the
iron is best accomplished by means of the mercury
cathode. The interference by titanium is partially
eliminated by measuring the absorbance of the
solution at both 582 and 700 mp and correcting
for the contribution at 582 mu from ftitanium.
The simultaneous determination of titanium and
aluminum in the scme test portion appears to
be possible and is to be the subject of further
work. Nickel, chromium, molybdenum, and niobium
do not interfere in determinations by this method.

Initial results obtained in the determination
of aluminum in synthetic solutions of samples
from corrosion tests were about 10% high. These
results indicate possible accumulative inter-
ferences, ond therefore further work is planned
to improve the reliability of the determinations.

SOLVENT EXTRACTION OF TITANIUM AND
NIOBIUM FROM ACIDIC SOLUTIONS WITH
TRI-z-OCTYLPHOSPHINE OXIDE

Studies of the application of tri-n-octylphosphine
oxide (TOPO) in the solvent extraction of metals
of interest in the ANP program were continued.
Since sulfuric acid is commonly used in the dis-
solution of fluoride salts, the extraction char-
acteristics of sulfuric acid by TOPO were also
investigated.

Extraction of Sulfuric Acid
T. W. Gilbert

Solutions of 1 to 8 M sulfuric acid were ex-
tracted with 0.1 M tri-n-octylphosphine oxide
(TOPO) in cyclohexone. The quontity of sulfuric
acid in the organic phase was determined directly
by titration with alcoholic potassium hydroxide
ond also by back-extraction of the organic phase
with water. The results were the same by either
method. The quantity of sulfuric acid extracted
was found to increase almost linearly with in-
creasing concentration of sulfuric acid. From
7.0 M acid, 0.77 mmole of sulfuric acid was
extracted by 1.0 mmole of TOPO. A third phase
formed when 8.0 M acid was extracted. The
third phase was analyzed for total acid and for
phosphorus. The ratio of H,50, to TOPO obtained
was 1.05.

Extraction of Titanium
T. W. Gilbert

Tri-n-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) dissolved in
cyclohexane has proved to be an efficient ex-
tractant for titanium from solutions of sulfuric
acid. The efficiency of extraction was found to
be highly dependent on the concentration of
sulfuric acid in the aqueous phase. In the ex-
traction of 0.16 mmole of titanium with 1.0 mmole
of TOPO, only 6% of the titanium was extracted
from 1 M sulfuric acid. From 7 M sulfuric acid,
however, 99% of the titanium was extracted. From
8 M acid, 99% of the titanium was removed from

the aqueous phase, but a third liquid phase was

formed.

The extraction of titanium from solutions 0.5 M
in tartaric acid in the presence of varying amounts
of sulfuric acid was also investigated. The
resuits were very similar to those obtained in

 
 

 

 

 

 

the presence of sulfuric acid alone; only a slight
improvement in the extraction of titanium was

observed. -,
A study of the extracthn of increasing amounts

of titanium from 6 M sulfuric acid with 1.0 mmole
of TOPO showed that saturation of the organic
phase occurred when 0.5 mmole of titanium had
been extracted. This result, when combined
with the results of an acidimetric study of the
sodium fluoride solutions used to strip the
titanium from the organic phase, indicates that
the principal species present in the cyclohexane

phase at saturation is TiOSO,.2TOPO.

Extraction of Niobium
C. A. Horton

Niobium(V) extracts best into TOPO in cyclo-
hexane from hydrochloric acid solution, fairly
well from sulfuric acid, and' almost not ot ali
from nitric or perchloric acid, with approximate
extraction coefficients for approximately 4 M
acid of 200, 20, 0.02, and 0.01, respectively.
For stable acidic solutions of over 0.2 mg of
niobium, the presence of citric, lactic, tartaric,
or oxalic acids or thiocyonate, peroxide, or
catechol are required to keep the niobium in
solution. For 500 pg of niobium in 0.2 M tartaric
acid, maximum extraction is obtained from 4 M
hydrochloric acid, as shown in Fig. 2.5.6. The
complexing agents must be added before the
inorganic acids in order to keep the niobium
in solution. The niobium in the organic layer
can be estimated by adding catechol and butyl
acetate to an aliquot of the extract and measuring
the absorbance at 360 mu. :

construction to the movement and pointer of o
galvanometer.  All these components can be
subjected to evacuation without damage and do
not offer any problems of excessive outgassing.
Other components, which cannot be conveniently
evacuated, including batteries, switches, and
Helipot precision resistors, are retained in the
original instrument cabinet outside the drybox.
All  balancing operations are thus carried out
remotely by adjusting the currents to the torque
motor. Electrical connections are effected through
four insulated conductors, which are sealed
through the walls of the drybox.

This balance will be used principaily for the

~preparation of synthetic samples to which trace

quantities of a constituent must be added with-
out exposure to atmospheric contamination or
moisture. It has already proved invaluable in
the preparation of simulated somples for tests
of the proposed method for the determination
of ~oxygen in metallic lithium (see preceding
section of this chapter). In these studies sub-
milligram quantities of Li,O were combined with
20-g samples of anhydrous Lil.

3.1. NICKEL-MOLYBDENUM ALLOY DEVELOPMENT STUDIES

MATERIAL DEVELOPMENT

T. K. Roche
J. H. Coobs -

H. Inouye

The developmental work on a new container alloy

for the liquid fuel, NaF-KF-LiF-UF , (11.2-41-45.3-

2.5 mole %, fuel 107), being considered for use in
odvanced. circulating-fuel reactors has been con-

cerned primarily with three major problems. First,
studies have been made for determining the optimum:
alloy composition for service temperatures up to
1800°F. The second problem involves determining
whether the most promising alloy, INOR-8, can be
produced as a ‘‘commercial’’ item. = Since all
nickel-base alloys exhibit mass transfer in sodium
at the service temperatures of interest, the third

problem is the fabrication of duplex tubing of -

INOR-8 clad with stainless steel for use in heat
- exchangers,

The research and developmental studies of the -
alloys had consisted of a-

nickel-molybdenum _
screening program until recently, when sufficient
data had been accumulated to indicate that INOR-8

was the most sat_isfdctory' of the alloys studied .
in terms of the original objectives. The data on
which the selection was based were obtained for -

INOR-8 and seven other INOR-type alloys at tem-
peratures up to 1500°F. Since forced-circulation

loop tests, both in-pile and out-of-pile, have n_bt ‘

been completed, and, in addition, comprehensive
weldability and strength evaluations remain to be

made, two other compositions, INOR-8 modified

and INOR-9, are aiso being studied as possible
alternates if INOR-8 shows excessive corrosion

~attack.

“or poor creep strength at 1800°F, The composi-

tions of INOR-8, INOR-8 modified, and INOR-9 are
given in Table 3.1,1. No data on INOR-8 modified
are as yet available.

-~ Tests of thermal-convection loops fabricated of

INOR-8 in which fuel 107 was circulated showed

‘acceptable corrosion resistance of the alloy at

1500°F, but no tests have been run at 1800°F. It
may be assumed, however, that if excessive cor-
rosion occurs at 1800°F it will be due to the
chromium content of the alloy, since in the tests
at 1500°F the chromium content of the fuel in-
creased with increases in the depth of corrosive
Therefore INOR-9, which contains no
chromium but is strengthened with niobium, is
being studied as a possible substitute in the event
that INOR-8 is not sufficiently corrosion resistant
at 1800°F. On the other hand, INOR-8 may prove
to be satisfactory from the corrosion standpoint
and unsatisfactory in terms of creep strength, and

- therefore the possibility of increasing its creep
‘strength with niobium additions, such as in INOR-8

modified, and with carbon additions is being in-

vestigated.

Although it is known that more than 0,10 wt %
carbon usually prevents the production of tubing
because of splitting along carbide boundaries,
present indications are that more than 0.10 wt %
carbon can be tolerated in the fabrication of plate
and sheet. Thus it is important that the effect of

“the carbon content on the creep strength of these
alloys be determined.

of a suitable carbon content may be produced by
carburizing tubing containing 0.10% or less carbon.

Properties of INOR-8

Physical Properties. — The density of INOR-8
has been determined to be 8.79 g/cm® or 0.317
Ib/in.3, and its modulus of elasticity at room tem-
perature in the annealed condition is 32 x 10% psi.
Data on its thermal expansion over various tem-
perature ranges are given below:

Tempercture Range Expansion
CF)  (pin./in. °F)
212--1832 8.6
212-752 7.0
752-1112 8.4
1112-1800 9.9

Fabricability. — The principal difficulty that has
been experienced in the fabrication of INOR-8 has
been the formation of large shrinkage cavities in
cast ingots. While the tendency for ingots to form
such cavities is inherent in the nature of freezing
of all molten metals, the tendency seems to be
somewhat accentuated in the case of INOR-8. It
is not known at present whether this casting diffi-
culty is attributable to the casting variables, the
expulsion of dissolved gases, or the temperature
range of freezing of the alloy. Irrespective of
their cause, cavities in an ingot can, in the worst
case, cause center bursts during forging, or they
can, in less drastic situations, cause center-line
defects that are detectable by ultrasonic inspec-
tion. Present approaches to a solution of this
problem include changes in casting practice, con-
sumable arc melting, and subjecting the molten
metal to a carbon boil. In all other respects, the
forgeability of the INOR-8 alloy is excellent.

Oxidation Resistance. — The oxidation resistance
of the nickei-molybdenum alloys in air is strongly
influenced by the chromium content. The studies
made thus far have indicated that no chromium is
better than a slight amount and that unless a
critical amount is present the oxidation rate is
not decreased to a level that can be considered to
be acceptable. As the data in Table 3.1.2 indi-
cate, the critical chromium content is approxi-
mately 6 wt %.

revealed corrosive attack to a depth of 1 to 3 mils
in 500 hr, and mass transfer was observed when
sodium was the circulated fluid. Forced-circulation
loops fabricated of INOR-8 are to be operated in
order to determine the effect of various amounts of
iron and chromium on the corrosion resistance of
the alloy when exposed to fuel 107. In-pile cap-
sule tests have also been initiated in order to
study the effect of radiation on the corrosion re-
sistance of the INOR-8 alloy. |

Mechanical Properties. — Details of the studies
being made of the stress-rupture characteristics of
the INOR-8 alloys are presented in a subsequent
section of this chapter. Most of the tests thus
far have been made ot a stress of 8000 psi ot
1500°F in fuel 107, The results of two tests at
1800°F and 3000 psi in fuel 107 are presented in
Table 3.1.3. Data for Inconel tested at 1650°F

are included for comparison.

Properties of INOR-9

Alloys in the INOR-9 classification have a nickel
base, 12 to 17 wt % molybdenum, up to 5 wt %
niobium, and up to 7 wt % iron. The constituents

Studies at University of Tennessee!

Studies of the solubility of chromium and molyb-
denum in nickel have been made with the use of
x-ray and metallographic methods. The composi-
tions studied ranged from 20 to 25 wt % molybdenum
and 3 to 15 wt % chromium.

The beta phase, Ni Mo, of the nickel-molybdenum
system was not observed in any of the ternary alioy
specimens. It was concluded that the addition of
chromium suppressed the formation of the beta
phase. As the alloying content was increased,
evidences of the existence of the gamma phase,
Ni,Mo; the delta phase, NiMo; and the primitive
orthorhombic *‘p'’ phase were observed. A report
in the form of a thesis has been prepared by T.S.

Several compositions were evaluated, and heat
B-3277 (nominal composition: 20% Mo-7% Cr-
1.5% Al-2% Nb-0.15% C) showed outstanding
creep strength, Thermal-convection loop tests of
this alloy with fuel 107 as the circulated fluid
showed that it was prone to attack by the salt be-
cause of its aluminum and chromium contents,
Attempts to operate forced-circulation loops fabri-
cated of alloys of this type were unsuccessful
because of the poor quality of available tubing.

The first heat (INOR-8M, ~5200 Ib) was poured

into a 3000-1bmold, a 1500-1b mold, and two 300-ib
molds. The composition of the alloy was within~
the specified range, except for the carbon content,
which was found to be 0.13%, and: therefore forging

studies were carried out on the maferlal One

300-1b ingot was worked on a 1000-ton press forge

and the other onan 18,000-1b hammer forge. Both

forging ‘methods worked the metal; but the press.
forge moved the material easier than did the hammer -
forge. The press forge worked one 300-Ib ingot to -
approximately 4 in. in diameter, and the hammer
forge made a 4-in. square.. Both ,forg_l_ngs were
cooled and machined to 3-in.-dia bars. The bars

were inspected by ultrasonic techniques and were

found, for the most part, to be unsound, . The forger
ingots were then sectioned and were also found to -
contain internal flaws, The unsoundness of the |
forgings was therefore ctmbufed to shrmkage_

previously,’ eight 9-in.-dio, - 12-in.-long billets,
two each of INOR-1, -2, and -5 ond cne each of
INOR-3 and -6, were extruded to 3)-in.-OD,
0.500-in.-wall tube shells  at the International
Nicke!l Company. Recently the reducing of these
tube shells was completed at INCO, and the re-
duced shells have been sent to the Superior Tube

Company for processing to 0.500-in, -OD 0. 045-m. :

wall seamless tubing.

Considerable delay was experlenced in completmg
the tube reducing of these shells at INCO for
various reasons. Primarily, the delay was caused
by unexpected difficulty in annealing the tube
shells following cold working on the tube reducer.
It was found that the alloys were subject to thermal
splitting when a total reduction of 30% or less was
given prior to annealing. This behavior was en-
countered at annealing temperatures between 1700
and 2150°F. However, by increasing the total cold
reduction between anneals to over 50%, the alloys
were successfully annealed at 2150°F  without
splitting. The tube shells, which were reduced to
1.66-in.-0D, 0.148-in.-wall shells at INCO,. have
been sent to Superior Tube Company, Descrip-
tions of the tube blanks sent to Superior Tube

high temperatures. The extent of mass transfer is

-temperature dependent, being slight at 1300°F and

tolerable -at 1500°F, For service temperatures of
1650°F and ‘above, it appears that a composite

‘tube, composed of a nickel-base alloy and type
316 stainless - steel, is desuroble and, possibly,

necessary. :

There are three basic problems assocmted wi th
the use of such composite tubing in fluoride fuel-
to-NaK heat exchangers. The first problem is the
fabrication of the composite tubing. Experiments
indicate that tubing of acceptable quality can be
made by following the practice of coextruding
composite billets. The high temperatures and
pressures used during coextrusion result in the
formation of metallurgical bonds. Dimensional
control is maintained by a suitable choice of the
starting composite and by conditioning of the tube
shell after extrusion. The outlook is optimistic,
since it is believed that composites of type 316

 stainless steel and INOR-8 should not be more

difficult to prepare than composites of Inconel and
type 316 stainless steel, which have been made in
substantial quantities.

The second problem is the welding of the com-
posite tubing. The mechonical properties of the
welds and the resistance of the weld nugget to
sodium mass transfer must be investigated. Con-
siderations of the properties of alloys intermediate
between INOR-8 and type 316 stainless steel may

provide information on these points.

The six intermediate alloys described in Table
3.1.8 were cast, fabricated, and aged to determine

aging femperatures on their tensile properties.
Thus far only the microstructures of the cast-and-
aged. alloys have been determined. It was found
that the alloys 1 and 6 were solid solutions, and
therefore they should not exhibit undesirable
mechanical properties. The other four alloys
showed small quantities of a precipitate. The
effects aond nature of the precipitate have not yet
been determined. Based upon the preliminary
study, the configuration for a tube header sheet

should be one in which the stainless steel is:

diluted by a minimum omount of the nickel-base
alloy after welding. ' '

The third problem involves an investigation of

the diffusion of the elements of one alloy into the
other, Since diffusion is a temperature-dependent
phenomenon, its effect is expected to be greatest ot

high temperatures. ' Of prime importance is the -

determination of the depth to which the various

elements will penetrate each other under a variety -

of conditions, since this will determine the thick-
nesses of the layers comprising the composite.
Since the nickel-base alloy is stronger thaon the
stainless steel at high temperatures, the composite
tube should contain as large o percentage as pos-
sible of the nickel-base alioy. The diffusion
effects have been studied in a series of tensile
tests of a composite composed of 50% |INOR-8 clad
on both sides with type 316 stainless steel. The
data obtained are shown in Table 3.1.9.

JOINING EXPERIMENTAL INOR-8 ALLOYS

R. E. Clausing G. M. Slgughter

Ten heats of experimental nickel-molybdenum
alloys similar to INOR-8 have been tested to de-
termine whether these alloys can be successfully

fabricated into complex components by means of
brazing and inert-gas-shielded arc welding and
whether, once fabricated, the material will have
suitable mechanical properties. Since the compo-
sition of Battelie Memorial Institute heat 3766 was
closest to the composition range of INOR-8, the
experimental results obtained in the study of speci-
mens of heat 3766 are summarized here. The
analysis of heat 3766 is compared with the compo-
sition range of INOR-8 in Table 3.1.10,

It was readily determined that specimens from
heat 3766 could be brazed in a dry-hydrogen atmos-

phere with Coast Metals brozing alloy No., 52 and
similar

brazing alloys by -using conventional

techniques.  The determination of weldability,

 however, was inherently more complex and time-

consuming. Many tests were required to determine

(1) that sound weld deposits could be made, that is,
deposits free of cracks and pores, as well as
excessive segregation, (2) that there would be no
deleterious regions in the heat-affected zone,
(3) that the base metal would not be subject to
hot tearing, and (4) that the mechanical properties
of the joint would be satisfoctory, both in the
as-welded and the aged conditions.

A test specimen was designed which permitted
nondestructive determination of the soundness and
freedom of cracking of the weld metal and the
heat-affected zone. This specimen also provided
material for metallographic and hardness speci-
mens, as well as the bend- and tensile-test speci-
mens needed for determining the mechanical
properties of the welded joint. The specimens

were machined from plates that had been welded

under a high degree of restraint. ~ The methods
used for obtaining the specimens were similar to
those shown in Fig. 3.2.18 of Chap. 3.2, '‘Develop-
" this report.

Examinations of many specimens of weld deposits
made by inert-gas-shielded tungsten-arc welding
procedures on BM!| 3766 base metal with filler
wire of the some material failed to reveal any
significont porosity and only one small root crack.
On the basis of these examinations, which were
made with dye-penetrant, x-ray, and metallographic
methods, it may be concluded that it should not be
difficult to make sound weld deposits in BMI 3766
joints,

Hardness measurements indicated that very little,
if any, hardening occurs either in the weld metal or
in the heat-affected zone as a result of aging for

200 hr at temperatures from 1100 to 1700°F, Aging

at 1700°F for 200 hr reduced the hardness of the_

weld metal to that of the base metal, while aging
at 1500°F for 200 hr results in considerable soften-
ing of the weld metal, Aging at 1100, 1200, and

1300°F for 200 hr did not appreciably change the

hardness. Metallographic examination of hardness
specimens indicated that the eutectic material -
which was present in the welds initially was 170
seemed fo have nearly identical base-metal and

partially spheroidized upon aging at 1500°F and

completely spherocdrzed upon agmg at 1700°F for i

200 hr, ,

Bend test specimens were eut from the - Welded
joints and tested in the as-welded and aged condi-
tions at temperatures ranging from 1100 to 1700°F

only the joint as a whole but also the various com-
ponents of the joint. For instance, the deformation
can be made to occur in a selected area, such as
the base-mefal—weld-metal interface, which might
not otherwise deform in the tensile test. The data
obtained from these tests are presented in Table
3.1.11 in terms of deflection when the load had
dropped to two-thirds of its maximum value. The
deflection values multiplied by a factor of 100
roughly correspond to the elongation values ob-
tained in tensile testing (that is, a 0.100-in, de-
flection corresponds to approximately 10% elonga-
tion in the standard 0.252-in.-dia tensile specimen).

- The maximum possible deflection with the particu-

lar machine used is 0.3 in, Therefore, when the
reported deflection is 0.3 in., the specimen is not
considered to have failed. An analysis of the data
in Table 3.1.11 reveals that none of the specimens
tested at 1100°F failed, that the specimens tested
at 1300°F in the aged condition exhibited con-
siderably less ductility than those tested in the
unaged condition, and that the specimens tested at
1500°F in the aged condition showed considerably
more ductility than specimens tested in the unaged
condition, This may be correlated with the ob-
served change in microstructure, that is, the dis-
appearance of eutectic material. Further, the speci-
mens tested at 1700°F also exhibited more ductility
in the aged condition than in the unaged condition.
This is again associated with the disappearance of
eutectic material, At 1300 and 1500°F the heat-
offected zone showed a loss in ductility when
compared with the base metal. However, the
ductility was equal to or greater than that of the

A number of tensile specimens cut from the
weldments were tested at temperatures ranging

from room temperature to 1700°F. The results of
these tensile tests, as shown in Table 3.1.12,

(Table 3.1.11). It may be noted that the speci-

- fact that one specimen failed in the weld at each

temperature, while duplicate specimens failed in
the base metal, with similar strengths and elonga-
tions. It may also be noted that very few of the
failures occurred at the gage marks, and thus it
appears that this material is not particularly notch

sensitive. Specimens aged at 1300 and at 1400°F
failed in the welds, and it seems that the weld
metal is weaker than the base metal, at least in
the aged condition. Unfortunately, the solution
heat treatments of the base materials tested at
room temperature and at 1500°F were not identical
with the solution treatment given the base material
used in making these welds. Therefore, a direct
comparison between the properties of the base-
metal tensile specimens and the base metal in the
transverse-test specimens is not truly valid. In
order to make such a comparison, base-metal
tensile tests should be made of specimens given
the same heat treatment as that given to the base
metal used in the tronsverse tensile tests, The
base-metal specimens should then be tested at all
the temperatures listed in Table 3.1.12, It would
also be desirable to test unaged tensile specimens

at 1300°F in order to verify the results of bend

170

tests, which indicate that aging decreases the
ductility at this temperature. |t should also be
noted that the room-temperature results indicate
that failures should occur in the base metal,

A comparison of the tensile properties of weld-
ments of Inconel, Hastelloy B, and the experimental
INOR-8 alloys is given in Table 3.1.13. Paort of
the data were interpolated and therefore may be
subject to some deviation from the actual values,
and the Inconel data for aged specimens are actually
data for unaged specimens, since it is thought that
any changes which would occur on aging for 200 hr
at the specified temperatures would not appreciably
alter the date. It may be noted that at nearly all
temperatures the values for the INOR-8 specimens
are between those for Inconel and those for Hastel-
loy B. In general, the strength is less than that
of Hastelloy B but greater than that of Inconel,
while the ductility lies between that of Inconel

Tests of specimens from Battelle Memorial
Institute alloy heats B-3874 through B-3879 were
completed.  As previously reported,'® no data
could be obtained on alloys B-3874, B-3875, and
B-3876 because of their poor welding characteris-
tics. Alloys B-3877, B-3878, and B-3879 ex-
hibited good stress-rupture characteristics but the
ductility was poor. A metallographic examination
of the specimen from heat B-3879, which was
tested in the annealed condition, revealed a small
grain size and a heavy concentration of carbides
in the grain boundaries (Fig. 3.1.2). In the past,
the alloys that have exhibited the best creep
characteristics have also shown this concentration

66%. The creep rates of both specimens were
similar, and thus the only difference was the in-
creased rupture life of the zirconium-bearing
alloy, which may be ctiributed to an increase in
ductility, The zirconium-bearing specimen, which
was tested in the annealed and aged condition is
shown in Fig. 3.1.5. Bands of various grain sizes
ranging from coarse at the surface to fine at the
center of the specimen may be seen. The usual
heavy concentration of carbide particles in the
grain boundaries that is associated with all the
high-strength nickel-molybdenum alloy systems is
also present. The specimen shows corrosion attack
to a depth of approximately 0.5 mil.

Although the INOR-8 alloy does not represent the
ultimate in mechanical properties which can be
cbtained from the nickel-molybdenum alloy systems,
it is superior to type 316 stainless steel and

176

Inconel at 1500°F in a fuel environment, as is
shown by the representative creep data in Table
3..18, Tensile tests of alloy 30-62 in air at
1500°F indicated a tensile strength of 46,000 psi
with 20% elongation, The maximum corrosive
attack observed corresponds to the corrosion

found for Hastelloy B in the same fuel environment.

tiny metal crystals was present over most of the
cold-leg surface, and, in addition, widely dispersed
clumps of metal deposits up to 6 mils in thickness
were found. The heaviest deposits found are shown
in Fig. 3.1.7. The deposits interfered with drain-
_ age of the fuel from the walls of the loop along
these portions of the cold leg, and therefore the
deposits were partially covered with a heavy
fluoride-mixture film, Samples of this film which
contained sizeable quantities of metal crystals

Before-test and after-test samples of fuel from
this loop showed no change in nickel and iron
contamination, but a slight increase in chromium
contamination was noted in the after-test sample.
It is assumed that Hastelloy W, which was used
as a filler wire in making the loop welds, served
as the source of chromium,

Thermal-Convection Loop Tests of Nickel-
- Molybdenum Base Alloys Exposed to
Fuel 107

D. A. Stoneburnerl' J. R. DiStefano

Two '_thermal_-convecztion loops constructed of
experimental nickel-molybdenum base alloys were
tested with the fuel 107 at 1500°F for 1000 hr,

The compositions of the alloys from which these

loops (Nos. 1136 ond 1155) were fabricated are

presented in Table 3.1.19, dlong with the results
of chemical analyses of the fuel circulated in these
and three previously operated loops. "
Metallographic examination of loop 1136 revealed
heavy surface roughening and pits along the hot-
leg surface to a maximum depth of 5 mils. In
addition, very large and irregular-shaped voids
were present at depths as great as 9 mils below
the surface. As may be seen in Fig. 3.1.8, these
voids were elongated in. the direction of the tubing
axis and did not appear to be connected with the
attacked areas above, They probably reflect fab-
rication defects rather than actual areas of attack,
The cold leg of loop 1136 showed light surface

roughening with no evidence of deposits. . The

analysis of the fuel after the test, as shown in
Table 3.1.19, indicated considerable reaction of
the fuel with aluminum and a slight reaction with
titanium, : :

lLoop 1155 showed heavy surface roughening and
surface pits, with heavy intergranular subsurface
void formation to a depth of 3 mils in the hot-leg

roughness, with second-phase material concen-
trated near the surface. No cold-leg deposits or
layers were visible, Fabrication defects in the
form of voids and cracks were found in the samples
examined. Such defects occurred generally to a
depth of 7 mils, although one crack extended from
the outer surface into the sample to a depth of

20 mils.

ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

A summary of thermal-convection loop test re-
sults has been prepared to provide a comparison
of the corrosion properties of the various nickel-
molybdenum base alloys tested thus far in fuel
107. In Tables 3.1.20 ond 3.1.21, the alloys are
grouped according to the level of attack found after
500- and 1000-hr tests at 1500°F. As may be seen

in Table 3.1.20, the maximum attack did not ex-
ceed 3 mils for any of the alloys tested, There-
fore it appears that none of the additions seriously
affect corrosion resistance from the standpoint of
total depth of attack. . In particular, additions of
chromium in amounts up to 9% and niobium in
amounts up to 5% had little effect on the depth of

as corrosion products in the fuel increased notice-
ably as the percentage of the element in the base
metal increased. It is interesting fo note that in no
case did alloys containing 20% Mo appear in the
column of noticeable attack (2 to 3 mils), whereas
alloys with similar additives but with a decreased

percentage of molybdenum did show notaceable.

Increasing the time of the test from 500to 1000 hr

caused the attack to increase 1 to 2 mils, as shown
in Table 3.1.2]. The maximum attack recorded
was 4 mils, and agcin none of the alloy additions
seriously affected the corrosion resistance,

Compatibility of Nickel-Molybdenum Base
Alloys with Molybdenum

It is expected that the use of nickel-molybdenum
alloys as materials of construction in molten fluoride
salt reactors will make possible a considerable in-

crease in the operating temperature attainable in -
The operating temperature of the

such systems,
moderator material will, of course, increase cor-
respondingly. At the temperatures being con-
sidered, moderating materials such as beryliium
oxide and the hydrides of zirconium ‘and yttrium
must be protectively clad with molybdenum. It is
necessary therefore to determine whether the molyb-
denum cladding will be compatible with nickel-
molybdenum alloys in a common flucride fuel
circuit, If it is found that-excessive dissimilar
metal mass transfer occurs between molybdenum
and these alloys, an outer cladding of a nickel-
molybdenum alloy over the molybdenUm w:ll become
an added requirement, .. .

Metallographic examinations revealed no evidence
of attack or metallurgical change of any kind along
the inner surface of molybdenum samples taken
from the top, middle, and bottom of the inserts
from both loops. Numerous fabrication defects
were found along. the inner surface of the insert
from the loop operated at 1500°F, and the wall
thickness of the insert varied considerably. The
outer surfaces of the molybdenum inserts revealed
no attack, but the insert from the loop operated
at 1500°F had an extremely thin metallic layer
in some areas. The samples from the bottom of the
insert showed less of the deposited layer than did
the middle and top insert samples,

The Hastelloy W surfoces that were exposed
to fuel showed heavy surface pits and shallow
void formation to a depth of 3 mils after the
test at 1650°F, and 2 mils after the test ot
1500°F, The Hastelloy W tested at 1500°F was
attacked in some areas and yet other areas were
completely free of attack. Also, the metallic
layer on the molybdenum insert was found opposite
the area of least attack of the Hastelloy W. The
Hastelloy W tested ot 1650°F had a very thin,
discontinuous line of particles immediately above
some areas of attacked surface. This line appeared

to be associated with foreign phases originally

present in the tubing which withstood attack by
the fuel.

The Hastelloy W cold-leg surfaces were moder-
and in the loop operated at
1500°F there were moderate surface pits and some
general subsurface voids to o depth of 1.5 mils.

test samples showed no evidence of serious inter-

~ action between molybdenum and Hastelloy W under

STRAIN-CYCLING AND STRESS-RE LAXATION
' STUDIES

C. R. Kennedy' D. A. Douglas

The studies in o program for investigation of the
strain-cycle properties of fine- and coarse-grained
Inconel were continued, with a series of tests
being made to determine the effect of strain re-
versals upon the creep properties of Inconel. Also,
other studies were initiated to defermine the strain-
cycle properties of Inconel weldments, of cor-
burized Inconel, and of reactor-grade beryllium,
The tests to be performed, with the exception of

the tests of carburized Inconel, will provide

engineering data to be utilized in determining the
life expectancy of structural members subjected to
strain reversals, The carburized-Inconel test pro-
gram is being run in conjunction with the alloy
development program (Chap. 3.1, ‘‘Nickel-Moiyb-
denum Alloy Development Studies’’) to determine
whether corburization is deleterious to the strain-
cycle properties of Inconel.

Results of strain-cycle tests of fine- and coarse-
grained Inconel tubular specimens at 1600°F in
NaF-ZrF,-UF, (50-46-4 mole %, fuel 30) are pre-
sented in Fig. 3.2.1, in which the plastic strain-

at 1500°F are also shown for comparison. As may
be seen in Fig. 3.2.1, the data indicate that the
strain-cycle properties ot 1600°F in fuel 30 are
very similar to those at 1500°F and again show
that coarse-grained Inconel is greatly affected by
this environment,

 The evaluation study of the effect of prior strain
cycling upon the creep properties of Inconel is
under way. The test procedure includes strain
cycling the specimens at 0.83% plastic strain per
cycle for different numbers of cycles at 1500°F and
then creep testing the specimen at 7000 psi. The
test results obtained thus far are shown in Fig.
3.2.2 as creep curves of specimen with 0, 100, and
300 strain cycles prior to creep testing. ' The
curves indicate that the creep strength and rupture
life are immediately reduced by the first 100 cycles.
The effect of 300 cycles does not further reduce
the creep strength; however, the total elongation

and rupture life are less than after the 100-cycle

test. The type of plot that will be produced when
the program is completed is shown in Fig. 3.2.3,
where the number of cycles prior to creep testing
is plotted vs the percentage loss of rupture life

favorably with the standard tubular test data, The
all-weld-metal specimen tested in fuel 30 was
given a 100-hr soak in this environment prior to
testing to allow corrosion to occur. As shown in
the table, the fuel environment seriocusly reduced
the number of cycles to failure. A metallographic
specimen, shown in Fig., 3.2.5, does not indicate,
however, that corrosion caused the premature
failure. In fact, it appears that the major inter-
granular cracks initiated at the inner surface where
no corrosion had occurred. |t theréfore appears
that the loss of life expectancy may have been
caused by defects in the weld or unfavorable
orienfation of the dendritic grains. Future tests
are proposed to check these findings.

During the operation of a reactor with e beryllium
reflector, the beryllium will be subjected to thermal
gradients which wiil resolve into strain, There-
fore, a test program was begun to investigate the
strain-cycle properties of hot-pressed, reactor-
grade beryllium. Strain-cycle tests at 1250°F
were completed and the results are shown in

BIAXIAL CREEP STUDIES
C. R, Kennedy D. A. Douglas

The performance of a particular type of test does
not always reliably indicate the manner in which
material will react under operating conditions,
The uniaxial creep test yields quantities of useful
information; however, the applicability of the data
to multiaxial stress conditions is questionable,
Therefore, in an attempt to achieve a better under-
standing of the behavior of metals under multiaxial
stress conditions, bioxial creep studies were
initiated. This program has as its aim the corre-
lation of the strain rate and the rupture life data
obtained in tests under uniaxial stress conditions
with data obtained under biaxial stress conditions,

A convenient way to vary the principal stress
ratios is to superimpose an axial load on a tubular
specimen, Thus, the circumferential and radial
stresses will be dependent upon the internal pres-
sure, and the axial stress will depend upon both
the pressure and the axial load. The machines for
strain cycling tubular specimens, which were
described previously,? are used for these tests.
This equipment provides a simple means for ob-
taining strain measurements in the axial direction

~ with-the use of a. dial ‘gage fastened to the pull

rod.  Rupture is determined by a drop of internal
pressure, which indicates the first complete crack

- through the wall of the tube. .The strain in the

tangential direction cannot be measured during the
test and can only be roughly obtained after failure.
.. The . tangential ~-stresses - applied- in. ‘various

“ biaxial creep tests were calculated by considering

that the stresses are elastic and that their distri-
bution is represented by fhederne’ equations. * The

ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

At high temperatures where intergranular fracture
is the cause of failure, there are two factors
commonly accepted as contributing to failure:
first, the consolidation of vacancies at boundaries,
and, second, stress concentrations arising at
boundaries because of relative motion of the
crystals, The first factor may well be a function
of the shear stresses, either the maximum shear
stress or the octchedral shear stress (maximum
shear stress deviator). In the case of the second
factor, the greatest principal stress present in the

system appears likely to be a measure of the rate

of propagation of the failure, Neither of these
two -factors alone appears to govern the time to
failure. The correlation is further complicated by
the apparent difference in rupture life in tests in
which the axial stress is greater than the tangential
stress and the rupture life in tests in which the
tangential stress was the greater. This behavior
may be caused by the material being isotropic;
however, the symmetry noted in Fig. 3.2.15 gives
an indication that this is probably not the case.
This same phenomenon has been reported by other
investigators3 in results of tests of tubes biaxially
stressed at low temperature, It is their explanation
that this anomaly is caused by an instability of the
uniform mode of deformation; this same instability
can also gradually develop under biaxial stress
systems in a simple tension test,

RELATIVE TENSILE PROPERTIES OF INCONEL
PLATE AND INCONEL WELD DEPOSITS

R. E. Clausing P. Patriarca

Knowledge of the relative strengths of weld
metal and base metal is required for the accurate
prediction of the behavior of welded assemblies.
In many instances it is necessary only to determine
that the weld is as strong or stronger than the base

material for the conditions of operation. Unless the

weld metal is subjected to unusual cenditions,
such as corrosion, impact loads, or loading which
will result in excessive weld-metal deformation,
failures which occur should be confined to the
base metal or heat-affected zones. If the weld
proves to be weaker than the base material, this
factor must be considered in the design of welded
components, Many times welds may be placed in
low-stress areas or may be mechanically reinforced
to provide the necessary strength.

In certain types of assemblies it is desirable to
match the properties of the weld with the properties

192

of the base material as nearly as possible.. Matched
mechanical and physical properties are important
in structures of uniform cross section which may
be expected to deform during operation. Unequal
strengths in the proximity of the welds will result
in unequal deformation and may result in stress
concentrations that will lead to early failure of
the component, Welds which are more resistant to
deformation than the parent plate may be as un-

- desirable as welds which deform more readily than

the base material,

Although in many instances it is not possible to
test welded assemblies in simulated service con-
ditions, short-time tensile tests provide much
valuable information regarding comparative proper-

ties of welds and parent material, Early tensile

tests of Inconel weldments indicated that, at room
temperature, failures occurred in the weld metal,
whereas, at elevated temperatures, the failures
occurred in the base material. Two specimens
that illustrate these conditions are shown in Fig,
3.2.17; one was tested at room temperature and
the other was tested ot 1500°F, The experimental
work reported here was undertaken in order to
determine the relative strengths and elongations
at failure of Inconel weld metal and base material.

A number of 0,252-in,-dia tensile specimens were
machined from an Inconel weldment, as shown in
Fig. 3.2.18. The weld was deposited as a fillet
by using INCO No. 62 weld wire and PS-1 (ref 6)
welding procedures, Preliminary testing revealed,
as indicated previously, that the specimens were
not likely to fail in the weld metal when tested at
the elevated temperatures of interest, It was
decided, therefore, to reduce the weld portion of
the specimen to a stondard size which would ensure
an all-weld-metal test section. The 0.252-in.-dia
specimens were etched lightly to accurately locate
the weld area, which was subsequently reduced to
a diameter of 0.126 in. with o gage length of 1/2 in.
A drawing of the resulting specimen is shown in

Fig. 3.2.19. Specimens of this type were used to

obtain the data reported here. Base-metal tensile
specimens were also prepared in the some manner.
The base metal had an ASTM grain size of between
6 and 7 and could be classified as fine-grained
material.

The Nicrobraz No. 130 alloy, which exhibited
the best corrosion resistance to both mediums, is
shown in Fig., 3.2.22, The only bad feature of this
alloy is that numerous voids were formed. This
void formation is attributed to the brazing cycle,
since the voids were present in the as-received
specimens prior fo etching. The composition of
this alloy is nearly the same as the compositions

of two other brazing alloys (Handy and Harman
Nos. 91 and 93) tested previously; the boron con-
tent differed slightly. It appears that with the
alloys containing 91 to 93% Ni, the porosity in
the fillet is related to the amount of boron in the
alloy. No porosity was found in Handy and Harman

During the examination of the fuel circuit of the

unusually deep intergranular voids were found in
tubes near the tube-to-header joints of the NaK
outlet header.? The Inconel tubing in this area
had relatively large grains because of the heat

viewing " the previous tests, however, it appears
that subsurface voids were much more concen-
trated in the grain boundaries of coarse-grained
tubing than in the grain boundaries of fine-grained
tubing, While the depth of the intergranular voids
in the coarse-grained tubing did not greatly exceed
the depth of voids in the grain matrix of fine-
grained samples, such tests indicate the possibility
of relatively deep attack under certain conditions

EXAMINATION OF ALL-WELDED INCONEL
IMPELLER THAT CRACKED IN SERVICE

G. M. Slaughter

The sump-type centrifugal pump (model DANA),
which was used for circulating the fuel mixture
NaF-ZrF“-UF‘ (50-46-4 mole %, fuel 30) in small
heat exchanger test stand SHE-C, was found,
during a routine examination aofter termination of
a test, to have a cracked impeller. The all-welded
Inconel impeller had operated for 2350 hr in the
temperature range of 1200 to 1500°F, with the
bulk of the operation at 1300°F. The location
and the extent of the cracks in the welded vane-
to-plate joint are shown in Fig. 3.3.1, and o
photomicrograph of one of the cracks is presented
in Fig. 3.3.2.

BRAZED-JOINT CRACKING TESTS
G. M. Slaughter |

Preliminary tests have been conducted to de-
termine the extent of braze cracking during the
fabrication of high-conductivity-fin NaK-to-air
radiators at the York Corp. The cracks have
resulted from the transverse shrinkage and dis-
tortion of the tube sheets during the deposition
of the longitudinal welds of the headers.

As a means of simulating the conditions under
which the cracking occurred, tube-to-header broze

fillets were prepared and then cracked by bending
the headers. The degree of deformation obtained
upon bending is apparent in Fig. 3.3.5, which
shows the samples before and after bending.
Bending of the header to the extent indicated
produced cracks which were considered to be-
visually representative of those found in the
radiators fabricated at the York Corp.

'Metallographic examinations of the cracked
joints revealed the cracks to be in the braze fillet.
In no case did the cracks penetrate into the tubes
or the tube sheet. A typical crack in the braze
fillet is shown in Fig. 3.3.6.

‘Sample joints were then rebrazed with and
without the use of additional Coast Metals No. 52
brazing slurry. The cracks appeared to completely
heal in. all cases. The addition of slurry to the
fillet before rebrazing appeared to be advan-
tageous, however, in that it permitted a more
uniform fillet and provided an additional source

" of alloy for healing the cracks.

G. M. Slaughter

As reported previously,! a study of some of the
problems associated with fabrication of the ART
fuel fill-and-drain tank is under way. Specifically,
tests are being run to establish suitable welding
and brazing procedures for making the tube-to-tube
sheet joints in the tank heads.

As a result of the high degree of restraint
exerted by the 1)y-in.-thick tube sheet, the tube-
to-tube sheet welds, when made with the stendard
fusion procedure used for thinner tube sheets,
have consistently exhibited root cracks of the
type illustrated in Fig. 3.3.7. In order to produce

joints free of such root cracks, a low restraint,
trepanned type of joint was designed. The joint
design and the welding procedure for obtaining
crack-free welds are presented in Fig. 3.3.8. A
machine welding method is preferred for the
fabrication of these joints in order to assure
consistency and reliability. Welds made according
to the prescribed procedure are shown in Fig.
3.3.9. |

Brazing experiments were also conducted in
order to determine the proper amount of preplaced
brazing alloy and the type of preplacement pro-
cedure to be used, as well as to evolve a suitable
brazing cycle. Calculations were made to de-
termine the amount of Coast Metals brazing alloy
No. 52 required to fill a 0.003- to 0.004-in.-wide
onnulus  between the %-in.-OD tube and the
I‘/z-in.-thick tube sheet. The results indicated
that two brazing rings, each weighing approxi-
mately 1.3 g, would be required for the brazing
of each tube. :

The configuration of the specimens, that is,
the thick tube sheet and the comparatively thin-

" walled tubes, posed additional problems.- When

the assembly is being heated to the brazing
temperature (1920°F), the temperature of the
massive tube sheet lags behind the temperature
of the tubes. Several joints may be seen in

Fig. 3.3.10 in which the brazing alloy failed to
fillet because the ring melted around the hot tube
ond did not wet the cooler tube sheet. The use
of radiation shielding, which minimized direct
radiation on tubes from the heat source, produced
the results shown in Fig. 3.3.11. Such shielding
definitely improved the reliability of filleting, but
the use of shielding would be impractical for the
fabrication of the full-scale heads. Therefore a
relicble brazing methed has been developed which
depends upon keeping the brazing alloy away

~from the tubes until the tube sheet has become

hot enough .to melt the alloy. In order to ac-

‘complish this, the brazing alloy is contained in

sump into the tube hole. A detail of the sump

the prepfacement procedure, but it is desirable
to prime the rings with a small amount of powdered
alloy wetted with Nicrobraz cement.

The brazing cycle finally decided upon provides
for a rate of temperature rise of 300°F/hr to the
brazing temperature of 1920°F, 1 hr at that
temperature, and cooling ot a rate of 300°F/hr.

ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

metallographic examinations would be extremely
beneficial. A preliminary study has therefore been
conducted to obtain the basic information needed
for such a correlation.

For this investigation, approximately 60 welds
were made by inert-gas-shielded arc welding of
short lengths of Inconel tubing, 9’“ in. OD with
0.025-in. walls, into holes drilled on the circum-
ference of sections of 3-in. sched-40 Inconel pipe.
Each weld was given o designation before it was
radiographed, and, ofter the films had been
carefully examined, the locations of pores were
noted on the weld specimens. Five welds that
contained defects were then removed and the
pores were located by alternately grinding and
polishing, with a microscope being used frequently
as a visual aid.

Gross porosity was found in every case where
it was revealed in the radiographic examination.
The sizes of the voids detected are summarized
in Table 3.3.1. It may be seen that the pores in
these five welds were relatively large ond thus
were readily detectable by careful radiographic
examination. A similar investigation will be

FABRICATION OF SODIUM-TO-NcK HEAT
EXCHANGERS
G. M. Slaughter

The brazing of the two sodium-to-NaK heat
exchangers recently received for installation in

208

the ETU north head was observed at the
Ferrotherm Corp. The brazing equipment, pro-
cedures, and general furnace cycles utilized were
described previously in connection wuth the fabri-
cation of radiators at the York Corp.?2 '

During the brazing of heat exchanger No. 1, the
exit dew point from the retort was approximately
~100°F throughout the brazing cycle. The spread
of the readings of the four thermocouples at the
start of the hold peried was 6°F, from 1914 to
1920°F, and at the end of the hold period was
11°F, from 1921 to 1932°F. All thermocouples
reached 1920°F ot some point in the brazing
cycle, but the moximum temperature attained was
1932°F.. During the brazing of unit No. 2, the
exit dew point from the retort was approximately
~95°F throughout the brazing cycle. The spread
of the four thermocouples at the start of the hold
period was 5°F, from 1918 to 1923°F, and ot the

end of the hold period it was 4°F, from 1920 to

1924°F. The maximum temperature aﬂumed was
1927°F.

Upon opening the retorts, the units were found
to be clean and bright, oand good filleting was
evident at all tube-to-header joints. Minor brazing
alloy run-off was noted at one header, but it is
thought that this could be minimized in the future

by the use of commercially available stop-off

compounds. The two job samples, which were
brazed at the saome time as the complete units,
were evaluated at ORNL and found to be satis-
factory.

INVESTIGATION OF MATERIAL FOR
RADIATOR HEADERS

G. M. Slaughter

Several NaK-to-air radiator headers have been
completely machined at York Corp. and cre ready
for welding to the tubes. York has reported,
however, that these headers were fabricated from
material which is difficult to weld. The welds
made thus far have cracked and have been found
to be porous. Further, there has been inconsistent
penetration.

Consequently samples of the header material
were transmitted to ORNL for examination and
evaluation.  Preliminary conventional machine

welding tests were conducted, and distinctly
different welding behavior from that of normal
Inconel was evident. The tube-to-header welds
of the York material had a *‘grainy’’ appearance.
Low-power examination and dye-penetrant in-
spection also revealed cracks in the welds.

In an attempt to determine the reason for the
observed differences in welding characteristics,
o metallographic comparison was made between
the York material and some lnconel plates of
known satisfactory welding characteristics. All
samples of the questionable material were found
to contain a quantity -of inclusions (possibly
oxides) distributed randomly as stringers. The
samples of known satisfactory ~characteristics
were relatively free of inclusions.: The distri-
bution and appearance of the stringers of the York
material are shown in Figs. 3.3.12 end 3.3.13,
and a typical area in material which has exhibited
satisfactory welding behavior is shown in Fig.
3.3.14.  The inclusions which appear .as dots
are probably titanium nitrides ond were evident
in all samples examined. Such inclusions are

apparently unobjectionable. Efforts to positively

establish the difference between these materials

other lots of inspected Inconel pipe in an effort

to ' provide the necessary quantity of suitable

material for York.

FABRICATION OF A SMALL SEMICIRCULAR

the two heat exchangers being fabricated will be

results is shown in Fig. 3.3.15. Work was not
started on the actual heat exchanger until all
procedures had been carefully planned. The
components of the heat exchanger are shown in
Fig. 3.3.16. All parts were minutely checked
before the assembly sequence was started.

Experimentation had ~ shown that successful

assembly of the tube bundle into the tube sheets,
and subsequently, into the channel would depend

‘primarily upon extreme accuracy in- the bending -

of the tubes. Consequently the jig shown in
Fig. 3.3.17 was built so that ‘the tubes could be

individually checked for conformity to the required
dimensions. - Thus, each tube in the heat ex-

changer was hand-picked for assembly by checkmg

_ it as shown in Fig. 3.3.18.

In thé course of os_sei'nblyk of the tubes into the

tube sheets it was found that small inaccuracies

in bending, even though within the specified
tolerances, gave rise to undue stresses under the
restraint of the comblike tube spacers. As a
result, a decision was made to stress-relieve the
tube bundle in the channe!l before welding and
brazing the tube sheets. The tubes were as-
sembled into the tube sheets, and the tube bundle

was placed into the channel with shim spacers
between tubes. The resulting assembly, shown
in Fig. 3.3.19, was sfress-relievse,cvl_. in dry helium
at 1500°F for 1 hr. After the stress-relief treat-
ment, the comb spacers were welded into the tube
bundle, ond the tube sheet welds were made.

Assembly methods dictated that the tube ends
protrude randomly beyond the tube - sheets, as

shown in Fig. 3.3.20. Since it is of prime im-

portance that the distence between the face of
the tube sheet and the first bend in each tube be
known accurately, the distance that each tube end
protruded beyond the tube sheet was measured
accurately with a depth micrometer before the

ends were cut off flush with the tube sheet. This

measurement was correlated with the over-all
measurement of each tube before assembly, which
was obtained by the photo-lofting technique illus-
trated in Fig. 3.3.21. The length of the cut-off
portion was subtracted from the original length
to obtain the required dimension.

The NaK inlet and outlet nozzles were welded

to the tube sheets before the tube sheets were.

to investigate the effect of fuel 107, o vanadium

capsule clad with type 347 stainless steel was

filled to one-third its- volume with the fuel and
inserted in a seesaw furnace apparatus for 100 hr

with the hot zone of the capsule at 1500°F,

A considerable amount of mass transfer was

found after the test in the cold zone of the

capsule, as shown in Fig. 3.4.1. The crystals
were found by chemical analysis ‘to ‘contain, in -
addition to vanadium, 0.95 wt % Fe, 0, 21 wt % Ni,
and <0.50 wt % Cr.  Thus it appeared that ‘the
vanadium . capsule material was - not- - pure. An’
analysis of the material from which. the cnpsule, -

was fabricated showed traces of the same . im-
purities with the same relative magnitudes. ~The

of over-all evaluation tests to - determine the

suitability of these materials as seat components
of valves for sodium or NaK service at 1000°F.
The specimens were tested at 1200°F rather than
at 1000°F in an oftempt to make the corrosion,

if any, severe enough so that the differences

in corrosion resistance would be more apparent;
however, metallographic examinations of the
tested specimens indicated that they were not

Solution rate studies of stainless steel speci-
mens (principally type 304 stainless steel) have
‘continued. The base-line solution rates observed
in this study at 1600°F (1.1 to 0.48 mg/in.2.hr)
- were of the same order of magnitude as the rate
of weight loss of specimens suspended in the
legs of thermal-convection loops (0.83
mg/in.2:hr) in which lithium was circulated for
~approximately 100 hr at a hot-leg temperature
of 1600°F, Additions of nitrogen or oxygen
(opproximately 1000 ppm) were found to increase
~ "the solution rate by factors that varied from
1.5 to 3 in 4-hr tests. The test apparatus is
particularly suitable for the screening of cor-
~ rosion-resistant - materials and for comparing
the effects of additives and lithium impurities
on the solution process. The main limitation of
the apparatus is the lack of an inert container
in which to perform the solution rate studies.
It -is hoped, however, that molybdenum will be
a satisfactory inert container.

- Several - type . 316 stainless steel-lithium
~‘thermal-convection loop tests have been com-
. pleted. . These tests were conducted with a hot-

"leg temperature of 1600°F, a cold-leg temperature
“at 1100°F, and a lithium velocity of 7 to 8 fpm.
~ The results of the tests have indicated that,
- -in" general, the rate of loss of hot-leg weight

- increased with .increased nitrogen ‘contamination
. of the lithium.. The lowest rate of weight loss
~ “in the 11 loop tests was approximately 60 mg/in.?2
" in 100 hr, which represents quite heavy and rapid

attack. - It was concluded . that further efforts
to reduce this type of corrosion by still further
elimination of nitrogen from the lithium were
not justified. Only two of eleven loops com-
pleted the scheduled 500-hr test without plugging.

ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

The nine loops plugged in times that ranged

from 31 to 457 hr. The weights of the crystals
found in the loops varied from opproxlmutely
1to4g :

Mass-transfer crystals were token from five
locations in each of eight different loops for
analysis.  The compositions of the crystals
varied considerably from sample to sample, but
the compositions are fairly well represented by

the over-all average composition shown in Table

3.4.2. As may be seen from the composition,
the crystals were high in chromium, nickel, and
manganese content in comparison with the base
material. Present plcns call for continuation of
this study with primary. emphasns on refractory
metals and corrosion inhibitors.

INERT ATMOSPHERE CHAMBER FOR
~ THERMAL-CONVECTION LOOP TESTING OF
NONOXIDATION-RESISTANT MATERIALS

E. E. Hoffman L. R. Trotter

A stainless steel inert-gtmosphere chamber in
which thermal-convection loop tests may be
conducted was recently constructed. This device
was built so that nonoxidatien-resistant materials,
such as the refractory metals, could be tested
in the unclad condition, since attempts to clad
molybdenum and niocbium with oxidation-resistant
alloys have been generally unsatisfactory, Almost
invariably, the refractory metals have cracked
either during the cladding operation or during the
corrosion test, and therefore the correding medium
(sodium, lithium, or fused salt) has .contacted both
the refractory metal and the cladding metal during
the test. A typical crack is shown in Fig. 3.4.7.
Other methods of protecting niobium from oxidation
are being studied, but none have been perfected
to date. :

- The essential features of the inert-atmosphere

chamber are shown in Fig. 3.4.8. Thermal-
convection loops may be operated in the chamber

. either under o vacuum of less than 5 u or with

an atmosphere of purified helium or argon. A
stainless steel liner is incorporated in the
chamber that serves as a thermal-radiation shield
for the outer walls. The liner would also simplify
cleaning of the chamber walls if a loop leaked.

Several preliminary tests of the chamber have

been conducted in order to determine the effec-
" tiveness of the system in protecting several

refractory metals from oxidation - ot elevated

temperatures.  In the first test, specimens of.

molybdenum ond "riiq:::bium ~were suspended in @
furnace inside the chamber- (argon atmosphere)

and heated to 1700°F for 23 hr and 2100°F for

1 hr. The specimens showed weight gains of

0.1 and 0.5 mg/in.2, respectively. In a second,
more comprehensive experiment, specimens of four
refractory metals were heated to 1700°F for 24 hr

in evacuated Inconel capsules and in the inert-

atmosphere chamber filled with argon at a pressure .

of 14,7 psi. Hardness measurements of these
specimens are compared with the hardness of
the as-received material in. Table 3.4.3. The

hardness values indicate that in all cases the
specimens tested in the chamber were softer
than as-received material but not substantially

-different from the specimens tested in the

evacuated capsules. The weight-change datq,

which were obtained only for the specimens

tested in argon, indicate that the argon atmosphere
was very pure. e ,
Since these results were encouraging, two
attempts  were made to operate unclad niobium
thermal-convection - loops in the chamber. In
both tests, leaks developed in the saddle-weld
areas of the loops. These welds had been made
in a dry box in an atmosphere of high-purity argon.

(loop 7642-3), were operated with sodium for
2000 hr in order to evaluate the comparative
aemounts of mass transfer that would occur in
these systems over relatively long periods of
time.”The maximum sodium temperature in both
loops was 1500°F, and a 300°F temperoture drop
was maintained between hot- and cold-leg sections.
The loops also contained by-pass cold traps to

contamination in the sodium. ‘

The crystalline deposits found in both loops
after shutdown were weighed, and the amounts
were practically the same, being 21 g for the
Hastelloy B loop and 20 g for the Inconel loop.
The value of 21 g for the Hastelloy B loop may
be compared with a value of 17 g for a similar
Hastelioy B .loop operated for - 1000 hr under
similar conditions.> It is evident that mass
transfer deposits form in a Haostelloy B system
in which sodium is circulated at a substantially
faster rate during an initial 1000-hr operating
period than during a subsequent 1000-hr period.
A similar situation exists in the case of Inconel
systems, although the decrease in the rate of
mass transfer during the second 1000-hr period
is somewhat less for Inconel than for Hastelloy B.
A plot showing the variation in mass transfer
buildup as a function of time for both sysfems
is presented in Fig. 3.4.10. Ll

in the cooled portions of the loop. The deposits
were similar in extent ond appearance to those
which have been observed in types 316 and 304
stainless steel loops operated under similar

DIFFUSION OF NICKEL IN LIQUID LEAD
J. L. Scott  H. N. Leavenworth, Jr.%

Studies of the effects of temperature and con-
centration on the diffusion of nickel in liquid
lead were continued as a part of an over-all
fundamental investigation of the mass-transfer
process. The initial work and the experimental
method were described previously, ond the dif-

fusion coefficients for saturated solutions of

various compositions were presented.” Additional
studies have now been conducted in order to
determine the effect of temperature on the diffusion
coefficient at constant composition. A constant
composition for a series of tests. was obtained
by saturating the lead, which filled the capillary,
with nickel at a given temperature, and then
making the diffusion measurements at a higher
temperature.  Saturation temperatures of 363°C
and 481°C were used for these tests. The results
are shown in Fig. 3.4.13, which is a plot of the

logarithm of the diffusion coefficient, D, vs the

reciprocal of the absolute temperature. The
curve for the saturation temperature of 481°C
is slightly above that for the saturation tem-
perature of 363°C, but the two curves are roughly
parallel. In order to determine whether the spread
in these curves was a result of random variation,

a statistical anclysis of the data was made. These

calculations showed that the curve for 481°C
differed from the curve for saturated solutions
at the 50% confidence level, but not at the 95%
level. The data for the curve for 363°C were
found to be significantly different from the satu-
ration data at the 95% confidence level. Thus,
it appears that the diffusion coefficient for nickel
in lead is a function of composition, even though
the saturation composition is less than 0.5 wt %

YTTRIUM METAL PRODUCTION

T. Hikido! R. E. McDonald?
Jo Ho CQObS

Experimental studies of the production of high-
purity ytirium metal were continued. In the process
being developed, lithium is used to reduce a mix-
ture of YF ;-MgF ,-LiF to yield an yttrium-magnesium
alloy. The fluoride mixtures used are prepared by
the Chemistry Division with the use of techniques
developed for fluoride-fuel processing (see Chap.
2.4, **Production of Purified Fluoride Mixtures'').
The results of the experiments completed thus far
are summarized in Table 3.5.1.

The low yields obtained in runs L-2 and L-3 have
been attributed to segregation in the crucible; that
is, the lithium is separated from the YF ,-MgF ,-L.iF
layer by the LiF slag, which has a density inter-
mediate between the densities of the two reactants,
In run L4, the reaction retort was tilted at a 45-deg
angle to increase the areas of the interface layers
and also to promote thermal-convection mixing.
The yield was increased from 67 to 83% by this
procedure.

3.5. MATERIALS FABRICATION RESEARCH

The lithium was added in the first three runs in
the form of sticks cut into short lengths. In run
L4, the lithium was transferred into the reaction
retort in the molten state by differential argon-gas
pressure. The molten lithium was filtered through a
porous stainless steel filter in this transfer process.

Experiments have been conducted on vacuum
heat treatment of the ytiriumemagnesium alloy to
distill off the magnesium and excess lithium. A
20-g sample of the yttrium sponge produced in this
manner from run L-1 was arc melted with the use
of a tungsten electrode under an argon atmosphere.
The oxygen content of the arc-melted button was

determined to be 1200 to 1300 ppm by a. vacuum- -

fusion analysis performed by the Analytical
Chemistry Division, A 30-g button from run L-2
has been arc melted and is now being analyzed.

the reaction given above is assumed to be essen-
tially the correct one, the data summarized in
Table 3.5.2 are applicable.

The dota of Table 3.5.2 are for equnhbrlum con-
ditions or as near to equilibrium conditions as
can be attained in an experiment of this nature.
The samples of BeO used were in powder form, and
Grossweinerand Seifert used water vapor in helium,
Elliott used H,0.0, and H,0-H,. It should be
pointed out that inactual practice it is not possible
to obtain a greater volatility than that indicated by
the equilibrium constant; that is, no concentration
or pressure can exceed the equilibrium. . The
dynamic conditions of the BeO(s) + H,O(g) re-
action would determine the amount of BeO carried
by the steam. Another important factor would be
the nature of the BeQ, that is, density, crystal
size, external surface area, etc. Another important
factor could be that another molecular species of
hydrated BeO would become the controlling species
under different experimental conditions.

The available data, which are probably quite
accurate, indicate that under some conditions it
would be entirely possible to corrode and transport
large quontities of BeO in steam in relatively
short times.

FABRICATICON OF HIGH-DENSITY BeO
R. L. Hamner

It has been found in the process of fabricating
BeO by hot pressing that the “Luckey S.P.”’-

grade oxide produced by Brush Beryllium Company
is equivalent to the ‘‘flucrescent’’ grade when
densities of 95% or greater are desired. Such
densities -are obtained by pressing at 1900 to
1950°C with a pressure of 2000 .to 2500 psi. A
quantity of high-purity BeSO, has been received
for experimental attempts to lower the temperature
of hot pressing and to obtain high-density material
by cold pressing and/or extrusion followed by
sintering ot about 1500°C. This experimental
approach is based on the production at Battelie
Memorial Institute® of a highly sinterable material
by carefully controlling the calcination temper-
ature to obtain an extremely fine oxide powder.

The hot-pressed BeQ specimens described below

~ were fabricated for physical tests:
1. five BeO cylinders, 2 x 2 x 1/2 in. ID; density,

97%; two cylinders damaged in machining;

The samples are rods approximately 3 in. in length
and '/2. in. in diameter, and they contain various
amounts of hydrogen, as shown in Table 3.5.3.
These pieces were made as part of an effort to
establish procedures for hydriding massive yttrium
metal,

Modifications have been made in the equipment,
which is now ready for production operation as
yttrium metal becomes available for hydriding. The
procedure to be used is based on a process,
developed at the General Electric Company, in
which a mixture of hydrogen and helium is passed
over the metal.

ART PROTOTYPE TEST RADIATOR
R. J. Gray J. E. Yan Cleve, Jr.

A metallographic examination was made of the
York Corp. ART prototype test radiator No. |,
which operated a total of 870 hr under the following
conditions:

|sothermal operation at 1200°F 390 hr

Operation with varicus temperature dif- 47 hr
ferentials and a meximum NaK inlet
temperature of 1200°F

Operction with varicus temperature dif- 360 hr
ferentials and a maximum NaK inlet
temperature of 1500°F

Operation at the design condition of a 73 hr
NeaK inlet temperature of 1500°F and
an outlet temperature of 1070°F

Thermal cycles, total 9]/2
Slow cycles at a maximum NaK tem- 7
percture of 1200°F
Slow cycles ot a maximum NaK tem- 2
perature of 1500°F
Fast cycle (50°F/min) to a NaK tem- I/i_,

perature of 1525°F

The radiator failed upon reaching full power in the
first controlled thermal cycle. The NaK inlet
temperature had been increased from 1350°F to

1525°F at a rate of 50°F/min and the outlet tem-

perature had remained constant at about 1070°F.

After the radiator had been cleaned it was
sectioned for examination, The section containing
the tube that failed, which was located by pres-
surizing the tube with wafer and observing the
leak, is shown in Fig. 3.6.1. The arrow paints
toward the tube that leaked, A close view of the
tube that failed is shown in Fig. 3.6.2. The
numbered arrows indicate the readily visible
holes, which appear as spots because of internal
lighting during photography. The metaliographic
examination did not reveal evidence of complete
penetration of the tube wall at either the circum-
ferential or the longitudinal fissures.

The some tube is shown in Fig. 3.6.3 rotated
approximately 90 deg. The dark area in the tube
is hole No. 1 in Fig. 3.6,2., The curvature of the
tube as it enters the header is evident. The good
condition of the tube may be attributed to the
promptness with which the fire that occurred as a
result of the leak was extinguished,

Hole No. 1, which was the largest of the three
holes, is shown in Fig. 3.6.4. The opening in the
tube wall in this plane measures 0.030 in. More
of the tube wall that appears at the extreme right
edge of Fig. 3.6.4 may be seen in Fig. 3.6.5.

Hole No. 2 is shown at a magnification of 100

Note that the shape of the metal is the same as in Figs 3.645,

under thermal gradient conditions. The NaK inlet
temperature during thermal-gradient operation was
1500°F or above for 541 hr, and the unit was
thermally cycled 21 times.

The fire damage was extensive, and therefore no
attempt was made to evaluate the integrity of the
brazed fin-to-tube joints. Of the 72 tubes attached

to the NaK inlet header, 29 were burned through
" and 5 more were found to be plugged. Four tubes

contained partial plugs, and one was completely
plugged. The plug was drilled out of the tube that
was completely plugged, and the plug material was

. found to be green in color, The partial plugs were

removed by scraping the tube walls and were found

~to -be brown to black in color,  Chemical analysis

‘wranivm and 4.19 wt % zirconium, -

The darker
moterial - contained 7 wt % U, 47 wt % Ni, 7 wt %
Cr,and -3 wt % Fe. The difference between the
iwo plugs therefore was that the dark-colored
naterial contained considerable mass-transfer
leposits. The presence of uranium indicates that
there was a leak of fuel into the NaK in the fuel-
to-NaK heat exchanger included in the circuit in
which this NaK-to-air radiator was operated. The

the following: sectlon.

PROCESS"ENGINEERING CORP. HEAT
EXCHANGER NO. 3, TYPE SHE-7

R. J. Gray J. E. Van Cleve, Jr.

A small heat exchanger of type SHE-7, which
was fabricated by the Process Engineering Corp.
and is designated No. 3, was ferminated after
1438 hr of operation with the fuel mixture NaF-
ZrF UF ;. (56-39-5 mole %, fuel 70). The unit
operated under thermal-gradient conditions for
1044 hr and was thermally cycled 21 times. Opera-
tion of this unit was terminated because of failure
of the radiator in the system (see preceding section

of fhi'_s chapter).

Thirty-one samples were removed from the tube

‘bundle and header areas and mounted for metallo-

graphic examination to determine the depth of
corrosion on both the fuel and the NoK sides.
The fuel-side corrosion was found to range from a
minimum of 0.001 in. to a maximum of complete
penetration. The NaK-side corrosion was found to
vary from general roughening of the surface to
penetration to a maximum depth of 0.004 in.

An area from the hot-header section is shown in
Fig. 3.6.11, As may be seen, the voids completely
penetrate the tube wall, but there is little or no
general corrosion. Adjacent areas in which the
same conditions exist are shown in Figs. 3.6.12
and 3.6.13. A metallic layer found on the fuel side
of a tube from the hot-header area is shown in
Fig. 3.6.14, Spectrographic analysis showed the
metallic layer to be 6.3 wt % Cr, 8,5 wt % Fe, and
76 wt % Ni. This metallic layer was not similar to
the gold-colored deposit found in the cool section
of a previously examined heat exchanger. The
gold-colcred deposit was found to have resulted
from corrosion of the header region.

The examination. of the heat exchanger did not
show any open cracks through the tube walls. The
presence of the uranium- and zirconium-bearing
plugs in York radiator No. 16 proved, however,
that a leck was present, Fuel probably leaked
through several of the tubes which showed com-
plete grain-boundary penetration, such as those

shown in Figs. 3.6.11, 3.6.12, and 3.6.13,

INCONEL CENTRIFUGAL PUMP THAT

J. H. Dchm R.S. Crouse

- An endurance test of an Inconel centnfugal pump
that circulated NoK was _terminated following
upproxumately 4400 hr of operation primarily at
1200°F,  -For some time before the ¢lose .of the -
test, there were indications that lubncatlng ol
had been leaking past the lower shaﬁ sea| and into
the NaK stream. ‘Upon shutdown, extensive earbon
deposits were found lmmedm:ely below the lower -
pump seal; “and all wetted parts of the pump were

dark ond tornished. Metallographic examination

was therefore made of some of the wetted parts

to determine the nature of metallurgical changes
which might have occurred during the test, The

- examination revealed a heavy carbide precipitate
" to a depth of approximately 5 mils along all Inconel

surfaces exposed to NaK. The extent of carburi-
zation, which is illustrated in Fig. 3.6.18, was not
sufficient to have measurably affected the me-

chanical properties of heavier Inconel sections,
although it was necessary to replace all thinner
- sections, such as bellows and diaphragms.

EDDY-CURRENT MEASUREMENTS OF METAL
THICKNESS '

R. B. Oliver | J. W. Allen
R. A. Nance

The Metal Identification Meter (MIM-1) developed'

for the sorting of Inconel, austenitic stainless
steels, and the common Hastelloys was success-
fully adapted to the thickness measurement of thin
sections of these alloys. A simple circuit change

allows adjustment of the scale range so that finite

thicknesses of these alloys, up to 0040-|n., can
be measured with a maximum error of £0,001 in.

The instrument was used to monitor the wall thick-
ness of a type 347 stainless steel cylinder while -
the wall was being lathe-turned from the original

‘/4 in. to 0, 020 in. The stainless steel cylinder,

which was 3/2 ft long and 6 ‘in. in diameter, was
fitted onto a wooden mandrel. - Both the Metal
Identification Meter and a resonance  ultrasound
thickness gage showed the finished wall thickness
to vary from 0.013 to 0,40 in. The readings made
with the two instruments agreed to within 0.001 in.
at all times. . The Metal ldentification Meter and

the resonance ultrasound instrument are both ex- -

cellent instruments for measuring metal thickness

when only one side of the material is accessible.

more accurate. The meter is compact, portable,
and simple to operate, and it requires no coupling
between the probe and the work surface. The
values of several components in the circuitry of

the eddy-current instrument can be changed so that

measurements can be made of thicknesses of metals
having conductivities beyond the range of detection
of the present model of the Metal ldentification
Meter.

‘A new instrument, illustrated in Fig. 3.7.1, for
the measurement of sheet and cladding thicknesses
This instrument is more

strument is being used in studies of the optimum

size from ;16 in. OD with a 0.025-in. wall to
'/2 in, OD with 0.065-in. wall. The rejection rates
were dependent on both the quality required and
on the minimum usable length, The average re-
jection rate was about 5%, with variations for
individual batches running from as low as 2%
to more than 10%. Factors that confribute to the
lower average rejection rate in comparison with
the rates previously reported were re-polishing
and re-inspection of ultrasonic rejects and the
removal of magnetic particles by a phosphoric
acid freatment,

INSPECTION OF PIPE
J. K. White R. W. McClung

Approximately 650 ft of Inconel pipe was in-
spected by the immersed ultrasound method during
the quarter with less than 1% rejection.  About
500 ft of the pipe, both 2}, and 3% in. sched 40,
was inspected with resonance ultrasound methods
in order to determine the wall thickness. For a
specified tolerance of +5% of the nominal wall
thickness, the rejection rate was approximately
90%; but for a standard tolerance of +10%, the
rejection rate decreased to approximately 10% of

" the total quantity of pipe.

250

. PLATE INSPECTION
R. W. McClung

The immersed ultrasound method was used for
the inspection of more than 625 ft2 of CX-900
Inconel plate in thicknesses ranging from % to
1 in. The rejection rate was less than 1%. Since
the inspected plate was, in general, larger than
the required size and rejected areas could be left
in the trim, it is difficult to accurately estimate
the true rejection as a result of defects,

CORE SHELL INSPECTION
R. W. McClung

Immersed ultrasound methods were developed for
the inspection of the Inconel reactor core shells.
The core shells are inspected both for the presence
of laminations and for the presence of radial
cracks. For the detection of laminations, 5 mega-
cycle ultrasound is directed perpendicularly to the
surface and along the radius of a shell, and
*‘ringing’’ within the thin wall is established,
Any damping of the ‘’ringing’’ pattern is indicative
either of a change of wall thickness or of the
presence of a lamination, For the detection of
cracks, the 5 megacycle ultrasound is introduced
into the wall of the shell with an incident angle
of approximately 17 deg; any crack lying approxi-
mately perpendicular to the path of the ultrasound
as it travels through the metal annulus will reflect
the signal and indicate the presence of that crack.

Areas on a core shell that indicate damping of
the “’ringing’’ of the ultrasound are also examined
with resonance ultrasound techniques to assure
measurement of the shell thickness with an accu-
racy of approximately 0.001 in, and to differentiote
between possible laminations in the wall and
sections of wall thinner than specified. The
instaliation for the continucus medsurement of
the wall thickness of a core shell is illustrated in
Fig. 3.7.3, and the facility for ultrasonic examina-
tion for the detection of laminations and cracks is

shown in Fig. 3.7.4.

and any change in thickness will cause a shift in
these resonance frequencies.. A lamination or an
unbonded area will appear as a change in thickness
and may be readily detected if the defect area is
at least one-fourth the transducer area. The in-
strument presents the amplitude of the resonance
pecks on the vertical sweep of a cathode-ray os-
cilloscope, and the frequency values, or thickness
dimensions, are displayed on the horizontal sweep
of the oscilloscope.

A modulation range of 2 to 4 megacycles was
chosen, since this range would produce two
harmonic resonances in the full 0.100-in. plate
thickness but would be too low to produce a reso-
nance in the 0.010-in. cladding layer. Also, in
this frequency range, on unbonded area in the
interface near the transducer results in a complete
loss of signal; while an unbonded area in the
interface on the opposite side from the transducer
results in a pronounced shift in the location and
spacing of the resonance peaks. This shift in

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 1957

the resonance frequencies is equivalent to a
change in thickness equal to that of the cladding
layer on the far side of the plate. If the unbonded
area approaches the area of the transducer, or is
greater, the set of rescnance lines representing
the full plate thickness will disappear oand a new
set of lines will appear; if the unbonded area is

less than the area of the transducer, both pairs of

resonance lines will be on the screen, A signal
gate is available on the instrument to aliow the
incorporation of visible and audible signals to
indicate the occurrence of an unbonded area,

‘Several of the larger unbonded areas detected
with resonance ultrasound and confirmed by
stripping the cladding layer from the plate are
shown in Fig. 3.7.5. The correlation observed
between the nondestructive ond destructive tests
indicates that the resonance-uvltrasound method is
a simple ond reliable way to locate unbonded
areas in this type of plate.

corrosion is 3 mils. Specimens from the outlet
side of the nose coil showed the greatest pene-
tration. Specimen 672, which was taken from the

and 8, is shown in Figs. 4.1.1 and 4,1.2,  Speci-
men 651, which was taken at the location of thermo-
couples 9, 10, and 22, on the nose outlet side, is
shown in Figs. 4.1.3.and 4.1.4. Specimens 672 and
651 both show the maximum depth of attack of
3 mils... A typical specimen which showed little or

no corrosive attack is shown in Flgs. 4,1 5 and
4.1.6. This specimen, No. 641, was taken approxi-

mately 13 in. from the face of the pump on the nose
inlet side,

A remotely operated lathe will be used to' open-

the impeller housings of the pumps removed from

in-pile loops Nos. 4, 5, and 6 so that the impellers

can be examined. ' The impeller housing of the

ARE Specimens

Six specimens from the ARE have been examined.
Specimen R8, a section from the pressure shell
wall, including a weld, is shown in Fig. 4.1.10. A
crack may be seen at the weld junction, and there
are several voids in the weld area.

A section from a serpentine bend in a fuel tube in
the center of the reactor, specimen R7, is shown
in Figs. 4.1.11 and 4,1.12. There was subsurface
void formation on the interior wall to a maximum
depth of 3.5 mils, but the penetration was not

~uniform. Some parts of the wall showed deeper and

more . dense penetration than others. The outer
wall of the serpentine bend, which was in contact
with sodium, showed what appeared to be a mass
transfer deposit (Fig. 4.1.13), in addition to some
subsurface void formation, The deposit had plated
on the wall to a maximum thickness of 1 mil.

Specimen R3, which was also taken from a ser-

~pentine bend ina fuel tube in the center of the core,

also showed some subsurface void formation;
however, the density and depth of penetration were
not so great as for specimen R7. The areas of
attack were localized, and some areas of the wall
showed no attack, as may be seen in Figs. 4.1.14
and 4.1.15. No deposit similar to that found on
specimen R7 was noted on the exterior wall,

CREEP AND STRESS-RUPTURE
TESTS OF INCONEL

MTR Experiments

An eight-specimen tube-burst creep test at 1500°F
in the MTR, as reported previously,’ resulted in

266

times to rupture that were much shorter than ex-

pected, and overheating of the specimens under
stress during reactor startup was thought to be a
possible explanation for the shortened rupture life.
Subsequent out-of-pile tests condu,c‘:ted‘-'by Douglas
and East of the Metallurgy Division in other
apparatus but under conditions that duplicated the
time-stress-temperature  history of the in-pile
specimens have indicated that the time to rupture
was not appreciably affected by the overheating
cycle. _

Another out-of-pile test in which the MTR dppd-.

ratus is duplicated is currently being conducted by
the Solid State Division. The time-temperature-
stress history of the in-pile specimens is again
being duplicated exactly. The apparatus used for
the Solid State Division test differs from the appa-
ratus used by the Metallurgy Division in that the
heaters and thermocouples are in the same chamber
as the specimens and contamination of the atmos-
phere is a greater problem. '

been cut from the irradiation plug and returned to

ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

ORNL. Examination of the specimens. for fracture

location and surface - contomlnoﬂon is scheduled-

in the hot cells. |

Temperature control in a recent MTR |rrad|cmon'3
of the elgh_t-spec_:lmen apparatus was . found ‘to ‘be -

difficult because of the steep gamma.ray heating

gradient in specimens oriented with their long -

axes along the direction of the gradient (specimens

parallel to beam hole uxis),' An out-of-pile mockup

of an apparatus with specimens mounted perpen-
dicular to the beam hole axis is being tested.

Only four specimens (instead of eight) can be.

accommodated in this apparatus, but improved
temperature  control should result during startup
and shutdown of the reactor.

LITR Experiments

Leaks of undetermined origin caused three stress-
corrosion experiments in the LITR to be discon-

tinved. Inconel specimens exposed to NaF-ZrF o

UF, (62.5-12.5-25 mole %, fuel 46) were being
tested at 1500°F and a stress of 2000 psi. One
specimen _had been in the reactor for 100 hr after
startup, but the other two were irradiated for less
than 24 hr. Since all the apparatus was leaktight
(as determined with a helium leck detector) before
irradiation, thermal stresses that occurred during
irradiation are believed to have caused opening of
brazed joints or tubing connections. The appa-
ratus now being constructed is being instrumented
to check the point of failure. The specimens that
failed are to be examined in the hot cells. The
apparatus that failed showed that improved furnace
construction had cllowed control of the temper-
ature at 1500°F for a wider variety of fuel loadings
and neutron fluxes than was possible earlier.

An experiment was carried out in beam hole
HB-3 of the LITR to investigate the effect of
irradiation on several kinds of thermocouple in-
sulation. Glass-insulated thermocouple pairs;
sheathed, swaged, MgO-insulated pairs; ceramic
insulators; and metal-sheathed, unimpregnated,
gloss-insulated pairs were tested. The specimens
were tested in air and in helium at temperatures up
to 1500°F. Measurements of electrical leakage
between the wires of a pair were made in each
case as a functlon of time, flux, mtegrated flux,
and occasnonal variations in temperature during
irradiation and during shutdown periods. The data
have not yet been correlated completely, but it
has been established that the insulating materials

270

.and practices used in past (and projected) LITR

and “MTR cpporctus “have not ‘caused errors .in
- temperature measurements. The only insulation
- that failed during the tests wasona metal-sheathed,
" unimpregnated, glass-insulated pair. The electrical
_ potential used during the tests was about 20 v. A
- metal-sheathed, swaged, MgO-insulated pair of the

type intended for use in the ART was included in

- these tests, buf a more definitive experiment that
~ will include a study of the effects of irradiation on

the resistivity of Inconel is to be conducted.

LITR YERTICAL IN-PILE LOOP
W, E. Browning

J. E. Lee, Jr. H. E. Robertson
M. F. Osborne R. P. Shields

The forced-circulation loop which was operated
in a vertical hole in the LITR for 235 hr, as de-
scribed previously,4 is being disassembled for ex-
amination and analysis of the fluoride fuel mixture
circulated therein. The loop has been removed from
the outer container, and the major subassemblies
have been detached. Examination of these sub-
assemblies is in progress. The supposition that
the pump became inoperative because of beormg
seizure was substantiated.

The two pump-shaft bearings were removed by
cutting laterally through the pump and shaft above
and below each bearing. The shoft in the bearing
nearest to the fuel could not be turned by the manip-
ulator, A black porous deposit was found on the
wall near the bearing that was, presumably, radio-
lytic decomposition products from the grease, The
shaft in the bearing just below the motor could be
tumed, but only a small amount at a time, and the
bearing above the motor turned freely. -All three
bearings had been lubricated with the same radiation-
resistant lubricant. The difference between the
behavior of the bearings is attributed to_the differ-
ence in dosages from the decay -of short-lived
fission gases as they diffused upward through fhe
pump.

Of the 55 thermocouples in the Ioop, 22 fctled
Seven of the failures were due to an open. circuit
in the platinum-rhodium leads. One thermocouple
failed because the bead came loose - from the
Inconel fuel tube, and 14 failed because both the

are presented in Figs. 4.1,22, 4.1.23, ond 4.1.24.
These thermocouples were located on the fuel
tubing in the high-temperature region of the loop.
Three beads were used for each thermocouple in-
stallation, as shown in Figs. 4.1.22 and 4.1.24.
Both leads had pulled away from one bead shown
in Fig. 4.1.22, and only one lead remains attached
to another of the beads. The pair of wires that
pulled away from the bead during operation are
shown in Fig. 4.1.23. The tapered ends are typical
of ductile failure in tension. Wires that broke about
Y to 1/2 in. from the bead are shown in Fig. 4.1.24.
The ends of these wires also show the tapered
effect illustrated in Fig. 4.1.23. The mechanical
damage of the lead wires probably occurred during
thermal expansion of the loop.

- The platinum resistance heaters and their lead
wires were examined closely to determine the
cause of failure of 4 of the 22 heater circuits.
The heating elements were in good condition, and

The average thermaleneutron-flux exposures of
several static corrosion capsules irradiated in the
MTR have been calculated from the Cof? disin-

The average fluxes for four of the capsules were
also determined by the yields of Zr?5 and Cs'37
from U235 fission in the fuel contained in the
capsules. The values are presented in Table 4,.1.3.

| ‘Boron Nitride

Boron nitride is similar to graphite in many re-

- spects, but it is white in color and much more re-

sistant to oxidation at high temperatures. Favor-
able results have ‘been obtained from radiation

damage tests conducted on boron nitride as a
_neutron shielding material. The tests were made,

primarily, to explore the general integrity of this
relatively new ceramic under irradiation and,

275

 
 

 

 

 

 

ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

specifically, to determine weight, density, and
dimensional changes, Boron nitride was obtained
from two manufacturers (Norton Company and The
Carborundum Company) in powder form and 3/1 gmine~
oD, l'/z-in.-long test specimens were hot pressed
from the powder. The Norton samples are designated
6002, and the Carborundum samples are designated
Cl.

The samples were irradiated in an inert atmosphere
either in quartz ampoules or in Inconel capsules.
High-temperature irradiations were made in the
Inconel capsules, and the quartz ampoules were
irradiated at the temperature of the test reactor
water, The high-temperature tests were monitored
by thermocouples pressed against the outer surface
of the sample with leads extending through a
ceramic seal in the capsule top. The thermal-
neutron dosage was calculated from the activity
of a cobalt foil located against the sample.

Surface darkening of the samples duringirradiation
is thought to have been caused by a metallic
deposit. The coating was found to be primarily
magnesium, with some silicon and traces of calcium
and copper. The irradiated samples retained good
crystallinity, The results of x-ray diffraction ex-
ominations of samples irradiated in the MTR are
presented in Table 4.1.4. The conditions of the
tests and the physical property changes resulting
from irradiation are described in Table 4.1.5, and
irradiated and unirradiated samples are compared
in Fig. 4.1.27. The dimensicnal changes that
occurred during the tests were small, and the
changes that were detected could not be definitely
attributed to radiation damage, since boron nitride
is a soft material’ and the micrometers used scraped
material from the surface during measurements of
the samples. Both the weight and the density
changes were less than 1%. The burnup values
shown in Table 4.1.5 are average values calcu-
lated on the basis of neutron flux and irradiation
time. Boron isotopic analyses are being made.

These tests indicate that boron nitride is un-
damaged by irradiation at a temperature of 1800°F
to a thermal-neutron dosage of 1.3 x 1020
neutrons/cm?.

Physical property measurements are now being
made on the four samples irradiated at 70°F. The
gas evolved during irradiation will alsobe analyzed.

 

7The samples had a Mohs' scale hardness of 2 before

lrradluhon, which increased to 2.5 during irradiation.

cycling history is also important, In a composite
plate of this type, which is essentially black to
neutrons, most of the (n,0) reactions occur in the
first few thousandths of aninch of sample thickness.
The core becomes harder and more brittle and the
stainless steel cladding acts as a bimetallic strip
that causes uneven stresses. The uneven stresses
are believed to be the reason for a large part of
the splitting and warping. An unirradiated stainless-
steel-clad B,C-Cu sample is compared in Fig.
4.1.31 with a sample irradiated at 200°C to a 6%
average B! burnup. No cracks are evident in the
irradiated sample. The separation of the core from
the cladding and the cracks which occurred at a
higher irradiation temperature and a higher bumup
are illustrated in Fig. 4.1.32.

In  out-of-pile tests it was demonstrated that
thermal stress domoge can occur in the absence of
irradiation. More cycles were required to cause
damage in the out-of-pile experiment, but the

irradiated samples had experienced a different
thermal-gradient history that may account for the
damage with fewer cycles, In the out-of-pile tests
the samples were cycled under vacuum by in-
serting and withdrawing them from a furnace. Two
temperature ranges were used for the tests: 75 to
650°C and 100 to 870°C. In the 75 to 600°C range
the heating rate was 300°C/min for the first minute
and 175°C/min for the second minute; the cooling
rate was 250°C/min for the first minute and
200°C/min for the second minute. In the 100 to
870°C/min range the heating rate was 960°C/min

cooling  rate was 600°C/min for the first Y min,
200°C/min for the second I/2 min, and 150°C/min
for the second minute. One cycle was a temper-
ature excursion from minimum to maximum and retum
to minimum. Descriptions of the samples and the
specific conditions of each test are given in Table

4.1.10.

Examinations of the specimens (at a magnifie
cation of 500X) after thermal cycling showed that
the Norton Company sample had not cracked or
chipped. Sample No. 2, fabricated at ORNL, is

 
 

 

 

shown in Fig. 4.1,33. This view of the core-to-
cladding interface shows no evidence of cracks.
The scratches were made during hond polishing.
Sample No. 3 was found to have one small crack
about 0,006 in. long ot the interface between the
copper and stainless steel layers. In sample No. 4
there was complete separation of the stainless steel
cladding from the copper layer over about one-
third the area on one face, as shown in Fig. 4,1.34.
Inaddition cracks were found in the core ends about
midway between the clad faces, as shown in Fig.
4.1.35. Sample No. 5 was similar to sample No. 4,
except that there was slightly more separation at
the interface and there were more cracks. in
general, sample No. 6 did not show as severe
interface separation or as many cracks as found in
sample No. 5. It was noted that small cracks
initially present in the material were enlarged.
Some cracks were found that started at the core-
to-cladding interface and propagated into the core.
The sample was not constrained durmg cycllng,
but after the test it was bowed about /32 n. in
the middle. Apparently unequal stresses were
created by the bimetallic cladding.

EFFECTS OF RADIATION ON
ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS

J. C. Pigg

The general results that have been obtained in
the investigations ofthe effects of nuclear radiation
on semiconductor devices indicate that the barrier
phenomenon should be studied under very closely
controlled conditions. The equipment necessary
for such a study is being developed. The experi-
mental results obtained during the quarter are

described below.

Experimental Resvlts

The results of gamma irradiation of IN 38-A
point-contact diodes (greased and ungreased),
described previously,® have been analyzed with

respect to annealing behavior, ond curves de-
scribing the behavior have been prepared. The
first effect studied was the temperature change of
the samples, as shown in Fig. 4.1.36. The initial
drop of the temperature may be of significance,
and no doubt the rise in temperature during the
first hour had some effect on the current through
the samples. In any event, the drop, or annealing,
in the current of the sample cannot be attributed
to temperature changes, since a rise in temper-
ature would be expected to increase the current
through the sample, and, in Figs. 4.1.37 and
4,1,38, it may be seen that the reverse currents
{(at 1-v bias) through the samples decreased with
time. The greased sample (Fig. 4.1.38) under-
went the most severe change, and it would be
expected that this change would be reflected in
the slope of the reverse saturation current, which
is indicative of the surface conditions of the
sample. In Fig. 4.1.39, however, it may be seen
that the slope of the reverse saturation current
does not show such a change. On the contrary,
the greased unit seems to have suffered less sur-
face change than the ungreased unit. At the end
of 37.5 hr of annealing, both surfaces were appar-
ently the same. An effect of surface coating on
the bulk characteristics is indicated in Fig. 4.1.40,
which shows the reverse current ‘Y’ intercept, or
the saturation current, of these samples. The
gamma-ray dosage the samples received was of the
order of 9 x 10'6 photons/cm?, which was sufficient
to cause bulk damage in germanium. Bulk changes
known to take place with a dosage of this magnitude
are all of such a nature as to decrease the bulk
conductivity of the sample. Speculation has led to
the possibility that a revision of the picture of
radiation effects in electronic barriers is in order,
but as of now there is insufficient evidence to
conclusively justify this revision. Experiments
are being planned to clarify this problem, however,
as described in a following section.

In view of the annealing observed in semicon-
ductor devices by moany workers, @ number of
questions have been raised as to the actual amount
of damage that may be introduced into a sample by
a given amount of radiation at a given flux level.
Such information is desirable in order to correlate
device data with data resulting from “studies of
bulk material. Many experiments have been per-
formed on bulk material in which the samples were
maintained at some low temperature, usually that of

liquid nitrogen, in order to ‘‘freeze in’’ the damage.
Application of the freezing principle to devices has
not yet been tried, but it could possibly provide
much worthwhile information needed in the solution
of some of the radiation-damage problems. It thus
seems to be worthy of preliminary investigation,
One such preliminary investigation has been
undertaken with fransistors.  Tronsistors were
selected because the information obtained would,
in all probability, have immediate value and because
the collector current, being a function of the emitter
or base current, would present any domage in a
magnified form; that is, any changes noted would
be indicative not only of the damage to the collector-
base diode but also of the damage to the emitter-
base diode. Although not presented in detail here,
the data resulting from this experiment indicate that
damage to devices can be frozen into the sample to
some degree. Whether this is all the damage or
even a significant portion has not yet been de-
termined, since it is possible that some annealing
occurs even at liquid-nitrogen temperature. In this
experiment, two samples were bombarded at liquid-
nitrogen temperature while two other samples were
bombarded at the facility ambient temperature. The
facility temperature was not recorded, but it was
approximately 20 to 25°C, After the irradiation the
cold samples were kept cold, and the warm samples
were allowed to anneal at room temperature.
Approximately 120 hr later the samples kept at
liquid-nitrogen temperature were allowed to warm
up, and the characteristics were observed.
Comparison of the characteristic curves of the
“warm’’ sample immediately after irradiation with
those of the *“cold’’ sample immediately after being
warmed to room temperature shows some difference
which might be attributable to annealing of the
warm sample while being irradiated. Comparison of
characteristic curves after the cold sample was
warmed shows, of course, significant annealing in
the warm sample. Refinement of this type of experi-
ment is indicated in order to determine not only the
amount of annealing after irradiation but to verify
possible annealing during irradiation. For instance,
it may be better to cool the samples bombarded at
room temperafure tfo liquid-nitrogen temperature
after the bombardment for comparison with samples
bombarded at liquid-nitrogen temperature., Longer
exposure would also provide more quantitative
information, since this would permit more annealing
to take place in the samples bombarded at room

288

temperature and would introduce more damage into
both the wam and the cold samples. Further
information from this experiment may be available
when characteristic curves taken on an **X.Y"
recorder are analyzed.

Results of the gamma-ray bombardment of the
coated and uncoated point-contact diocdes indicated
that it would be advisable to determine whether
there was any difference in the effect of radiation
on devices of different but known material con-
ductivity, Samples of point-contact diodes espe-
cially constructed from material of known re-
sistivity were therefore obtained and bombarded in
the Solid State Division gamma-ray source. Several
curves showing the results of the bombardment
have been prepared. 7

The diodes studies were CK-708's made by the
Raytheon Company from crystals of known re-
sistivity. There was no coating material on the
crystals. The four samples selected were 4, 4.1,
11, and 12 ohm-centimeter material, respectively.
Two of the samples were bombarded in such a
manner as to permit data to be taken while they
were in the gamma-ray source. The other two
were irradiated at the same time, but were not
wired for data-taking. 4

In view of the temperature dependence of the
reverse current of the samples, a normalization of
currents with the temperature of the gamma-ray
facility was attempted. An approximate normali-
zation of the current was taken from the curve of
Fig. 4.1.41. This normalization is considered
sufficiently accurate when compared with the
accuracy of the instrumentation. When normadli-
zations of this type are made in the future, more
effort will be expended on the normalization curve.
In order to eliminate temperature effects, the curves
of the results of this experiment were prepared to
show only those points which were taken at the
ambient temperature of the irradiating facility,
that is, about 25°C.

It is immediately noticeable from Fig. 4.1.42 that
the conductivity of the 4 and 12 ohm«cm diodes,
which are the ones from which data were taken
while they were in the source, are similar and
that the conductivities of the 4,1 and 11 ohm-cm
diodes are similar. The observed curmrent is the
product of the current density and the area of the
barrier. Since the area of the barrier depends upon
the contact pressure, as well as on the conditions
of forming, it is possible for diodes made from

while in these samples the current increases, It is
evident that other factors are involved. There
would be, of course, a point at which the bulk
effects would begin to show, but higher dosages
then those given to these samples would be re-
quired. The dosage required can be estimated by
referring to previous work done on gamma-ray
bombardment of diodes in which the reverse current
at 1 v continved to rise until a dosage of 1,75 x
107 r was reached and fell thereafter.!0

Two components of the current which composed
the total current through the CK-708 diodes — the
bulk current, represented by the saturation current,
and the surface leakage, represented by the satu-
ration slope -~ are shown in Figs. 4.1.43 aond
4.1.44. In the present model of a diode, these
currents are in parallel, and the sum of the currents
represents the total current through the diode.
Such is not the case, however, and this discrepancy
is part of the reason for the speculation regarding
the need for a new model.

The study of the germanium junction as a function
of both temperature and radiation is being hampered
by instrumentation difficulties. The study is to
be as precise as possible, and the sample currents
are to be measured at voltage biases as low as
10 mv. Difficulty hos been encountered with a-c
electrical pickup in the servo-controlled power
supplies and in providing high-impedance inputs to
a Brown recorder, which has a normal impedance of
500 ohms. The servo power supply has been com-
pletely redesigned and now incorporates a number
of advanced features not ordinarily found in re-
cording systems of this type. An input impedance
of 180,000 ohms has been obtained. A block
diagram of the system is shown in Fig. 4.1.46.

modifications of the servo power supply for the
system are the high-impedance input, the variable-
gain amplifier, the velocity-damping network, and
the variable-phase chopper power supply. Recent
modifications of the Brown recorder servo circuit
are the high-impedance input, the variable-phase
chopper power supply, the positive-current feedback-
damping network, and jitter filter. Other improve-
ments in the system have included replacement of
certain relays to reduce the current through selectro
switches, and replacements of certain relays
which were shown to be incapable of carrying the
necessary currents. The samples for this experi-
ment are IN-91 alloy junction diodes. For com-
parison, a germanium bulk sample is bombarded
with the diodes. The lifetimes and the barrier
heights of the diodes are measured following
irradiations. Changes in the resistance of the bulk
sample provide a check on the neutron dosage to
which the samples are subjected.

Both the dicdes .and the bulk sample have been
bombarded at ~78°C in a facility that has a fast-

292

neutron flux component of 1.66 x 10% neu-
trons/cmZ.sec., After irradiation, the characteristics
curves of the diodes were recorded at -~78°C, and
the diodes are to be warmed to 0°C. Sample
characteristics will be recorded while the samples
are being warmed. Bombardments up to and in-
cluding a dosage of 10! neutrons/cm? have caused
little change in the diode samples. After a bom-
bardment to a dosage of 102 neutrons/cm?, a
flattening of the forward curve at —78°C has been
observed. The reverse current is not observable
at this temperature. The samples are being held at
~78°C pending replacement of faulty relays so
that characteristics may be recorded during the
wormup period.

Experimental Refinements

It has been noted that the changes observed in
the irradiations performed both in this program ond
in other programs cre, for the most part, opposite
to those expected from the results of bulk or sur-
face studies. Therefore efforts have been made to

compile quantitative information concerning the
behavior of barriers or rectlfyang devices in the |
presence of radiation fields so that, by comparison
with the results of bulk and surface studies, those
chcrccter:shcs unique to the barrier can be defined.
Further refinements of these studies are being
made. Several samples of barriers of known charac-
teristics have been obtained and will be studied.
The equipment necessary for fhese stud|es is bemg ,
designed, built, or purchcsed '
‘A probe mechanism is bemg constructed that
consists basically ofa fine screw-driven base which
will carry a scmple under a probe for determination
of its resistivity as a function of sample displace- .
ment and to determine location and ‘change of the
junction in a sample. '
As mentioned before, the surface conditions or
surrounding environment of a device can play a

more significant part in the behavior of the device
than would be expected from the results of bulk or

- surface studies. In order to eliminate or at least

minimize surface effects it has been decided to

" prepare  samples for irradiation in a stondard

atmosphere. A vacuum has been proposed and may
be tried, but, for the present,.helium will be used,

- since it will provide a heat transfer medium in the

event gamma-ray heating becomes a problem, A
dry box has been obtained, and ‘it will be meodified

‘to provide a helium atmosphere, To further assist
_in sample preparation, a small chemical hood has

been designed and is now being built. This will
permit the safe use of etches in the preparation of
the samples and in changing the surfaces after the
samples have been bombarded. :
In order to increase the range of voltages which
can be applied to a sample and thereby obtain

293

 
 

 

 

 

information about break-through characteristics
and to enhance the accuracy of saturation slope

data, an *“X-Y'’ recorder with increased ranges is

being obtained. A sample power supply that will

“be compatible with the characteristics of the

recorder is to be designed. The recorder can
measure applied voltages up to 100 v on either
scale, and thus the range is beyond the maximum

voltage at which most diodes operate. With proper
. shunts it will be possible to extend considerably

the range and the types of units which can be
studied.

Another multipoint recorder has become available
with which to constantly follow changes in a sample

294

over a period of days. A controlled-voltage power
supply is also available, and it is thought that
with moderate modifications it will be suitable for
use with the recorder. A recorder of this type willi
do much to clarify such changes as the initial
drop in current of the 12 ohm-cm dicde, as shown
in Fig. 4.1.42, Clarification of such changes is
necessary for a conclusive understanding of the
mechanism of changes in semiconductor devices,

The design of the fast-flux irradiation facility
discussed previously is now being detailed. No
date for completion of the design has been set,
but the werk is proceeding satisfactorily.

RADIATION ATTENUATION MEASUREMENTS
IN PLAIN WATER, BORATED WATER,
AND OIL

D. W. Cady! E. A. Warman?

A comparison of the attenuation of fast neutrons,
thermal neutrons, ond gomma rays in various
liquids has been made through the use of the Lid
Tank Shielding Facility {LTSF) at ORNL. The
liquids investigated were - plain water, borated
water, and transformer oil. The borated water
used in these tests contained 1.34 wt % natural
boron and had a density of 1.05 g/cm3. The
transformer oil was composed of 86.7 wt % carbon
and 12.7 wt % hydrogen cnd had a denslty of
0.87 g/ecm® at 20°C.

In order to avoid mlxmg of the borated wuter or
oil with the plain water in the lid tank, these
materials were contained in the usuval *‘configura-
tion'’ tank which was positioned as close to the
source as was physically possible. The con-
figuration tank is constructed of mild steel and
has dimensions of 654 x 72 x 7]'/ in. The pro-
duction of capture gamma rays in the tenk wall
near the source was reduced by the insertion of a
%-in.-thick aluminum window in the side of the
tank adjacent to the source. A 2-cm gap between
the source and the window was filled with air
contained in a thin plastic bag.

Thermal-neutron, fast-neutron, ond gamma-ray
measurements taken in the three media contained
in the configuration tank are shown in Figs. 5.1.1,
5.1.2, and 5.1.3, respectively. Before the data for
plain water can be. compared with previously
published measurements,3:4 which were taken in
the lid tank rather than the configuration tank, the
new curves must be shifted 3 cm to the left. The

agreement between a thermal-neutron traverse in
the lid tank and a traverse in the configuration
tank, with the latter data shifted on the graph a
distance of 3 cm to the left, is illustrated in
Fig. 5.1.4.

The previously reported curves for thermal-
neutron fluxes in oil and inborated water represent
data taken with the instrument response normal-
ized to gold-foil fluxes in plain water. This
normalizing procedure is not particularly valid,
as is indicated by a comparison of counts-to-flux
conversion factors used over a period of time.
For example, the current conversion factor used
with a ]2'/2-in. BF, counter in plain water, ob-
tained by normalizing to the data taken with gold
foils in plain water, is 1.66 x 10=3. Previously,
this same factor would have been used for this
counter for all media. The newly determined con-
version factor for borated water is 9.78 x 10=4, a
change of about 41%. Similarly, the conversion

the source plate by a I4'-in.-thick shutter. Lid
tank data are obtained by determining the dif-
ference between the shutter-open aond shutter-
closed measurements. The old Y%-in. shutter did
not completely shield the source plate from the
reactor thermal flux; therefore, even with the
shutter closed, there was fissioning in the source
plate. When the shutter-closed readings are sub-
tracted from the shutter-open readings, a small
percentage of the source-plate power is eliminated
as background. Thus, an increase in the shutter
thickness essentially increased the effective
source-plate power. This increase is small enough
to fall within the uncertainty in source-plate
power (15%), and therefore a more exact deter-
mination of the new effective source-plate power
will be made.

Thermal-neutron measurements in wdter are-now
being corrected for the flux depression that re-
sults from the presence of the gold foils and for
self-cbsorption and *‘self-shielding®’. in the foils.
 

 

 

These corrections were not made on previously
reported curves.3%

Although it is commonly assumed that the flux
depression for *‘thin'’ foils is negligible, calcula-
tion of the flux depression caused by 2-mil-thick,
1-em2 gold foils in water, oil, and borated water
were made. Several methods of calculation were
attempted, 78 and each produced a different re-

sult, The figures reported here are based ona

method suggested by W. R. Burrus.® The prelimi-
nary values obtained were 8.5% for water, 5.9%
for oil, and 5.0% for borated water. Little flux
depression is normally expected in borated water,
but the amount of boration in the LTSF water is

~so slight, 1,34 wt %, that the 5.0% value is

reasonable. it should be noted here that cadmium-
difference flux measurements in borated water are
of dubious validity. The cadmium ratio is so
small, about 1.5:1, that the errors inherent in
taking the difference between two large, neorly
equal, values are considerable.

The self-absorption correction is a correction to
the measured activity of the foil after exposure.
Since the foil cannot be infinitely thin, there will

be scattering and absorption of the radiation in:
the activated foil itself. Hence the true activity
of the foil, or counting rate, will be reduced by
some factor which is dependent on the foil thick-

ness. The dependence of the self-absorption on

the foil thickness can be calculated roughly by

assuming an exponential absorption and an ab-

" sorption coefficient _independent of the depth in
which the particles are em:ﬂed Based on the
assumption that one-half the thickness of the foil

contributed to the self-absorpnon, the calculat:on

yields a self-absorptlon factor for a 2—m|l-thnck :

gold foil of approx:mately 1%.

if a foil is quite thick, enough neutrons will be
absorbed so that the nuclei in the center of the
foil will **see’’ a lower thermal-neutron flux than

can be seen by those at the surface. if the ratio
of the absorption to the scattering for the foil is
large, the ‘‘self-protection,’’ or *‘self-shielding,"
can be calculated because the incident flux suf-
fers an exponential decrease in the foil.” For a
2-mil-thick gold foil this caleulation yields a
‘‘self-protection’’ factor of 1.5%.

sion, self-absorption, and self-shielding is shown

STUDY OF ADYANCED SHIELDING MATERIALS
E. A. Warman?2

The thermol-neutron data that were omitted from
the previous report® on the group of tests per-
formed to aid the ANP shield design effort of
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft are reported here. These
data’ present detector response measurements
normalized to cadmium-difference gold-foil fluxes.
The gold-foil fluxes have been corrected for flux
depression by the 2-mil-thick foils and for self-
absorption and self-shielding in the foils, as
described in the preceding paper.

The configurations tested included Hevimet,
stainless steel, boral, and lithium hydride, pre-
ceded by a beryllium reflector-moderator and backed
by borated water to mock up borated alkylbenzene.
The materials and their experimental arrangements
were described previously;5 however, subsequent
chemical analysis of the borated water has shown
that the boron content of the water was 1.34 wt %
rather than the 1.46 wt % reported previously.

A comparison of the thermal-neutron measure-
ments taken in water and in borated water (refer to
Fig. 5.1.1 in preceding section) showed that the
addition of the boron was quite effective in re-
ducing the thermal-neutron flux. The borated
water curve had a slightly steeper slope than that
of the water curve. The thermal-neutron flux in
the borated water was a factor of 29 below that
in plain water 15 cm from the source plate and a
factor of 36 below the flux in water at 120 em. It
should also be noted that the hump in the curve in
the forward region was not as pronounced in
borated water because of the greater percentage of

due to the Hevimet not being os effective as

short distances beyond the Hevimet. However,
the attenuation of fast neutrons in the Hevimet
resulted in a reduction of the thermal-neutron flux
at greater distances. '

In configuration 27 a lé-in.-thicl«: boral curtain
was placed between the beryllium and the Hevimet.
The thermal-neutron flux was somewhat lower than
that beyond configuration 26 for short distances
beyond the Hevimet but was raised so that curves
of the data for the two configurations approxi-
mately coincided at greater distances. This pos-
sibly indicates that the effect of the boral be-
comes negligible at these distances.

Configurations 28, 29, 30, and 31. — The thermal-
neutron flux measurements beyond configuration 28
(Fig. 5.1.7) show the effect of adding 12 in. of
lithium hydride behind configuration 27. The flux
was lowered by about a factor of 2 immediately
following the lithium hydride and approximately a
factor of 2.7 at a distance of 100 cm from the
source plate. This indicates a softer neutron
spectrum. The thermal-neutron measurements

thickness of lithium hydride (configuration 29)
appear to be inconclusive owing to the decreased
thermal-neutron flux and to instrumentation dif-
ficulties; no thermal-neutron data were obtainable
for configurations 30 and 31.

Configurations 32, 33, and 34. — The effect of
placing a l-in.-thick stainless steel pressure
shell beyond configuration 27 was studied in
configuration 32, The change in the slope of the
thermal-neutron flux curve may be partially ex-
plained by the fact that steel is less effective as
a thermal-neutron shield than is borated water.
Also, the iron in the steel has a dip in its cross-
section curve for 23-kev neutrons, which allows
a large number of neutrons of this energy to escape
into the borated water where they are subsequently
thermalized. These effects would cause an in-
crease in the thermal-neutron flux in the forward
region of the curve. On the other hand, scattering
of fast neutrons in the steel increases the prob-
ability for their absorption in the region further
from the source and causes the curve to go below
that of configuration 27 in this region.

In configuration 33 the effect of increasing the
thickness of the beryilium reflector-moderator used
in configuration 32 was studied. The addition of
4 in. of beryllium resulted in an increase in the
thermal-neutron flux near the shield surface be-
cause of the large percentage of thermalization of
neutrons in the beryllium. The flux dropped in the
region further away from the source because of
the capture of these same neutrons by the boron
and hydrogen.

Configuration 34 was an attempt to determine the
effect of reducing the thickness of the Hevimet
gaomma-ray shield used in configuration 32. Sub-
tracting 2 in. of Hevimet allowed on additional

2 in. of borated water to be added to the back of

the shield, which resulted in a decrease of the
thermal-neutron flux at short distances out in the
borated water. The flux increased, however, at
greater distances and was slightly above that of
configuration 32. The results for configurations
32, 33, and 34 are compared with those for con-
figuration 27 in Fig. 5.1.8.

THE SUPPRESSION OF CAPTURE GAMMA RAYS
BY LITHIUM IN LEAD

J. D. Kington

One of the problems that confront reactor shield
designers is that of shielding against secondary
gamma rays produced by the capture of thermal
neutrons in lead. A search of the litercture re-
vealed that a process for fabricating a lithium-
lead alloy was patented in Germany in the 1930’s

and that the eutectic contained 0.67 wt % lithium.
A lead sample containing 0.67 wt % lithium was
then fabricated by the Metallurgy Division, and a
preliminary experiment at the Bulk Shielding
Facility was performed in order to investigate the
effectiveness of the lithium in reducing the cap-
ture gamma-ray production in the lead. It was
found that lithium distributed throughout lead was
approximately as effective as boral covers on a
pure lead shield.

MECHANICAL DESIGN'

A method of suspension for the TSR-Il that will
allow a beam of radiation from a collimator through
its shield to sweep both a vertical plane and o
horizontal plane has been chosen and the design
is being examined from structural and stability
standpoints. In order to permit rotation of the
beam in the vertical direction it was necessary to
reduce the length of the reactor tank from that
used in previous designs. The relative dimensions
of the TSR-Hl, as now designed, are shown in

Fig. 5.3.1.

NUCLEAR CALCULATIONS?

As was reported previously,3 a nuclear parameter
study was carried out with the 3G3R code on the
Oracle to establish the dimensions of the TSR-II.
The resulting configuration had a 17.5-in.-dia
internal water reflector, a 5.5-in.-thick core region,
a 7.875-in.-thick external water region, and an
aluminum-to-water volume ratio of 0.57. Similar
calculations have now been performed on the
UNIVAC with the Murine code. A comparison of
the values of concentration vs reactivity from the
two calculations revealed that @ change of 0.3%
in the thermal-neutron macroscopic absorption
cross section, % o for the Oracle calculations was
all that was required to obtain complete agreement.
Results of the Oracle calculations with the revised
value of X are compared with the UNIVAC cal-
culations in Fig. 5.3.2. The agreement is such
that. control problems and the effects of various
shells in the design are to be investigated almost
entirely with the Oracle 3G3R code, and only the
final results will be checked by a repeat calcula-
tion with another code.

Calculations have also been performed to de-
termine the total amount of reactivity that could be
controlled with a boral shell in an internal water
reflector. An ideal case was used with the dimen-
sions given above. A boral shell was placed at

the core-internal reflector interface and the trans-
mission of thermal neutrons through the shell was
varied from 0 to 100%. With zero transmission of
thermal neutrons the reactivity that could be con-
trolled was found to be 11%. For these calcula-
tions the transmission of fast neutrons was as-
sumed to be 100%, and thus the result should be
conservative, The change in the thermal-neutron
flux produced by the insertion of the zero trans-
mission shell is shown in Fig. 5.3.3.

FUEL ELEMENT DEVELOPMENT?

The fuel element development work is near com-
pletion. Of the 71 different fuel plate sizes re-
quired for the two types of elements, 60 plates
with depleted fuel have been rolled to the correct
shape. It is necessary to determine the proper
rolling sequences to produce plates with the proper
thickness and with length and width both held
closer than the usual MTR tolerances. Delivery
of a three-cylinder hand roller sufficiently long to
accommodate the longer fuel plates of the annular
elements has made it possible to fabricate several
dummy annular elements. Inspection of these
elements shows them to be well within the toler-
ance necessary for operation in the TSR-1l. One
of the annular elements is shown in Fig. 5.3.4.
Two views of a quarter section of the reactor core
formed with the dummy aluminum elements are

shown in Fig. 5.3.5.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONTROL DEVICE®

Improvements were made in the TSR-Il prototype
control mechanism and a new method was employed
to measure the distance traveled by the control
plate under scram conditions as a function of time
after scram. The design changes were of a minor
nature but tended to reduce friction in the posi-
tioning device and guiding system. The effect of
the changes was to bring the operating pressures
more in line with the calculated values. As

 

4The fuel element development work is being per-

formed by the ORNL. Metallurgy Division.

5The control system for the TSR-1l is being developed
by the Reactor Controls Group.

Calculations have been carried out in order to

around the TSR-ll core. For, these calculations,
the core was assumed to contain 9 kg of U233 and

to have an aluminum-to-water core volume ratio of

0.57. The caleulations involved two steps: (1) o

“caleulation of the heating in the core at the core-

shield interface, and (2) a Monte Carlo Oracle

the core-shield interface, coupled with an as-
sumption for the angular distribution at the inter-
face, was used as the source term for the Monte
Carlo calculation. The two steps are described in
detail below.

Heating at the Core-Shield Interface

For the calculation of the core heating at the
core-shield interface, the core was divided into
seven spherical shells (see Fig. 5.3.7) chosen so
that a reasonable average flux could be assumed
for each shell. The source distribution was as-
sumed to be proportional to the thermal-neutron
flux as calculated by the Oracle 3G3R code for an
aluminum-to-water volume ratio of 0.707 and core
dimensions of 20 and 40 cm. This flux plot was
scaled to the assumed core dimensions (22.225-cm
inner radius and 37.46-cm outer radius) and was

308

vused for the calculation, although the aluminum-
to-water volume ratio in the calculation was
specified as 0.57. The gomma-ray spectrum from
each source shell was then divided into six energy
groups, which were arbitrarily chosen as 0.5, 1, 2,

4, 6, and 8 Mev.

According to the usual transformation from a
spherical-shell source to an equivalent infinite
plane source (neglecting the back plane),® the
core heating at the core-shield interface as a
function of the initial energy E, leaving the source

heating was then the product of the heating.per
energy group in the core and the ratio of the
aluminum-to-core energy absorption coefficients.
The results are tabulated in the third column of
Table 5.3.3.

For the lead heating, Eq. 1 was resolved for the
heating in the aluminum at the aluminum-lead
interface, by using the new distances involved and
by including the effect of the thin shell of alumi-
num on the linear and energy absorption coef-
ficients. The buildups in the core and aluminum
were assumed to be the same. The resulting heat-
ing as a function of the energy group (which
agreed to within several per cent of that estimated
in the preceding paragraph) was multiplied by the
ratio of the lead-to-aluminum energy absorption
coefficients to give the results tabulated in the
fourth column of Table 5.3.3. Naturally, it is not
expected that this estimate for lead will be as
good as that for the aluminum shell, and no reli-
ance is placed on it other than for comparison with
the calculation discussed below.

 

) Hicollided) = [¢4-Me§ (4 Mev) + &9 y0
collided collided

Since the Monte Carlo code yields gamma-ray
heating as a function of initial energy and angle of
incidence, it was necessary to find the energy and
angular distribution of the flux incident upon the
shield. The energy flux incident upon the shield
was estimated by dividing the calculated heating
for each initial energy group at the core-aluminum
interface into collided and uncollided fluxes. The
uncollided flux for each E, was determined by
solving Eq. 1 without buildup factors or absorption
coefficients.

The total collided heating for each E in the
core was found by:

Hicollided) = Hiuncollided) [B(R) = 11 .

This was assumed to be made up of collided fluxes
of the energy group E, under consideration plus
collided fluxes of each lower energy group E cor-
responding in size, except for the upper group, to
the initial groups E,. For example, for E, at
4 Mev:

Ho(2 Mev) + &y oy #5(1 Mev) +

collided

+ ¢0-5-Mev ua(O.S Mev) + @9 1 .Mev £ (0-1 Mev) | K .

 

Heating Within the Shield

The Oracle Monte Carlo code'® for the heat de-
position resuiting from the penetration of gamma
rays through stratified slab shields was used to
calculate the heating in various TSR-1l shield
layers which were arbitrarily chosen as follows:

1. the first layer of aluminum,

2. the six equal regions in the first layer of lead,
3. the second aluminum layer,

the water layer,

the third aluminum layer,

the five equal regions in the second lead layer,
the two equal regions in the final borated
aluminum layers which were considered all
aluminum,

These layers are shown in pictorial form in

Fig. 5.3.7.

collided collided

The relative values of the collided fluxes in the
above equation were obtained from the ratios of the
areas under the differential energy spectrum curve
for each E,, as given by Goldstein and Wilkins?
for a point isotropic source after passage through
one mean free path of water. This was possible
since the relative spectrum for each E; is nearly
independent of the distance from the source for a
number of mean free paths. Figure 5.3.8 illustrates
such a curve for an E, of 4 Mev. With the ratios of
the collided fluxes for each E known, it was pos-
sible to solve Eq. 3 and obtain the collided num-
ber flux for each energy group. The sum of the
collided and uncollided fluxes for each E gave the
total incident flux for each energy group.

It was assumed for the uncollided fluxes that the
radiation was isotropic in the source planes and,
since the back plane correction is unimportant, the
angular distribution should also be nearly the
same as for infinite plane sources. This angulor

Although Eq. 9 was developed for the uncollided
flux, for this calculation it was assumed that the
collided flux reaching the shield had the same
angular distribution as the uncollided flux. Hence
Eq. 9 was solved for the total heating in each
region in the shield by using the total flux in each
energy group. One example of the integrand of
Eq. 9 for one energy is shown in Fig. 5.3.11.

The total heating evaluated in each region in the
shield by Eq. 9 is shown in the form of a histo-
gram in Fig. 5.3.12. The heating in the aluminum-
water-aluminum region and in the final lead and
aluminum region was not significant compared
with that in other regions and hence is not illus-
trated. Also shown in Fig. 5.3.12 are the results
of the estimates for the first aluminum ond lead
regions calculated with Eq. 1 and described in
the last two paragraphs of the preceding section.

Conclusions

The calculation of heating in the regions outside
the core should be an upper limit of the actual
case and therefore serve as a safe basis for de-
sign. This is due to the source of leakage radia-
tion being slightly overestimated, since the buildup
factors used for attenuation within the core apply
to an infinite medium and ignore the depression
from the lead layer around the core. This depres-
sion is largest for collided photons arriving in
directions nearly tangential to the core-shield
interface., These photons would be expected to

contribute strongly to the heating just at the

inner edge of the lead where the heating is the
most important. .

A further extension of this calculation is pres-
ently under way to remove the dependence of the
calculation on the energy and angular distribution
at the shield interface by utilizing the data from
the calculation by Bowman and Trubey (see

 Chap. 5.4, this report) to extend the Monte Carlo
- calculation from the shield to the source planes

in the core.

MONTE CARLO CALCULATION OF GAMMA-RAY
PENETRATION OF ALUMINUM SLABS

D. K. Trubey

A Monte Carlo calculation of the energy spec-
trum and angular distribution of gamma rays which
penetrate 3-, 6-, and 9-in.-thick aluminum slabs
has been carried out by using the Oracle code
discussed previously,! For this calculation the
gomma rays were assumed to be incident normal
to the slabs and to have initial energies of 0.662
Mev (the energy of Cs'37 gamma rays).

The energy balance for the three slabs, that is,
the fraction of energy reflected, absorbed, or trans-

MONTE CARLO CALCULATION OF THE GAMMA-
RAY PENETRATION OF LEAD-WATER SLABS

L. A, Bowman? D. K. Trubey

The DO2C55 series of calculations of the gamma-
ray penetration of lead-water slab shields, described
previously,! has been continued, and a total of
512 problems has now been computed. All combi-
nations of the following parameters have been used:
slab thicknesses of 1, 2, 4, and 6 mean free paths,
consisting of eight varying percentages of lead
preceding or following water; initial gamma-ray
energies of 1, 3, 6, and 10 Mev; and angles of
gamma-ray incidence of 0, 60, 70.5, and 75.5 deg
from the normal. The results include information
on heating, dose rates, and energy fluxes through-
out the slabs; energy and angular distributions
reflected back by the slabs; and energy and angular
distributions transmitted through the slabs.

The data from all these problems are now being
analyzed. Typical plots are shown in Figs. 5.4.4
through 5.4,7, which represent the heating caused
by 3-Mev gamma rays incident at various angles on
lead slabs 4 mean free paths thick., Note that the
heating values in Figs. 5.4.6 and 5.4.7 are re-
duced by a factor of 2 for ease in plotting.

MONTE CARLO CALCULATION OF GAMMA-RAY
DOSE RATE BUILDUP FACTORS FOR
LEAD AND WATER SHIELDS

L. A, Bowman? D. K. Trubey

The DO2C55 series of Monte Carlo calculations
discussed in the preceding paper also included
calculations of dose-rate buildup factors for lead
and water shields, sketches of which are presented
in Fig. 5.4.8, Only the results for gamma rays
incident normal to the slabs are reported here.

In the first group of calculations buildup factors
were determined for all-lead slabs which were 1,
2, 4, and 6 mean free paths in thickness at the
initial gamma-ray energy. The initial energies were
1, 3, 6, and 10 Mev. The results are compared
in Fig. 5.4.9 with the buildup factors computed at
NDA by the moments method for an infinitely thick
slab, The results are in agreement except near
the rear of the slabs, where the Monte Carlo curves
are lower, This is due to the reduction in back-
scattering in the slabs having finite thicknesses,

The Monte Carlo buildup factors for all-water
slabs of finite thickness are compared with NDA
buildup factors for on infinitely thick slab in
Fig. 5.4.10. In this case the Monte Carlo calcu-
lations always predicted higher values for the
buildup factors.

Values of the Monte Carlo dose-rate buildup
factors at the rear of composite lead and water
slab shields are plotted in Figs. 5.4.11 through
3.4.14 for total composite slab thicknesses of 1,
2, 4, and 6 mean free paths. The effect of alter-
nating the position of the lead and water is apparent
from these figures. :

All the buildup factors determined for composite
slabs in this series have been compared with
