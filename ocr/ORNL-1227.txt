SUMMARY AND

Analysis of the circulating-fuel
aircraft reactor has been extended
to systems incorporating intermediate
heat exchangers, various secondary

coolants, liquid moderators, and the

use of heavier reactor shielding
(sec. 1). All these systems utilize
the fundamental advantage of the bi-
functional fuel-coolant, and appear to
be capable of supersonic nuclear
propulsion. The location of the heat
exchangers around the reactor results
in lower shield weight, even with a
larger shielded-volume diameter, than
a tandem reactor and heat exchanger
arrangement. In order to perform a
limited amount of aircraft maintenance
without special shielding, various

modifications of the minimum divided

shield specifications have been in-
vestigated.

Studies of the performance and
design of the circulating-fuel air-
craft reactor are sufficiently en-
couraging that the first Aircraft
Reactor Experiment (ARE) to be con-
structed by the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory will be of this type (sec.
2). The reactor core, as designed for
the ARE, consists of a beryllium oxide
moderator with a multipass fuel-coolant
system. The core and a surrounding
beryllium oxide reflector are contained
in an Inconel pressure shell. Design
of the reactor, fluid circuits, build-
ing, and assoclated equipment are
essentially complete. The reactor is
expected to be in operation early in

1953, ‘

The developmental work in reactor
plumbing and associated hardware has

been primarily concerned with the

technology of high-temperature fluoride
mixtures, and a secondary effort has

been the study of liquid metals (sec.

INTRODUCTION

3). The techniques of the prepara-
tion, purification, and handling of
the fluoride mixtures have been
developed so that 100-1b batches of
the treated fluoride may be prepared
and loaded 1in adequately cleaned test
equipment. Techniques of pumping,
sealing, and controlling the fluoride
coolants and lubricating moving parts
of the systems have been demonstrated
at temperatures above 1300°F, and it
is considered that these techniques
are adequate for ARE application.
A centrifugal-flow fluoride pump has
operated for weeks with neither me-
chanical failure nor leakage. Liquid
sodium technology appears to be well
in hand, since continued success has
been experienced in the operation of
sodium (or NaK) pumps, seals, and heat
exchangers. The NaK-to-NaK heat ex-
changer loop has now operated for 2300
hr with a maximum temperature of 1500°F.
Gross heat transfer studies indicate
that space-economical systems and
components can be built to handle
copious quantities of heat, as required
by fluoride systems, at temperatures

between 1200 and 1800°F.

The reactor physics calculations,
which have further defined the statics
of the circulating-fuel ARE, have led
to some general observations regarding
the kinetics of both the circulating-
fuel ARE and ANP reactor (sec. 4).
Although the thrombosis effect is an
important concern in the control of
these reactors, the loss of the delayed
neutrons may not be i1f the circulation
of the fuel itself 1s as good a damping
mechanism as now indicated. These
kinetic difficulties are of less con-

" cern to the ARE than to the ANP, since

the circulation rate in the ARE is so
slow that the control rods can cope
with the thrombosis effect and a large
fraction of the delayed neutrons are

emitted into the active volume. The
current ARE design has a critical mass
of 22.3 1b, a total uranium investment
of 74 1lb, 71% thermal fissions, and a
leakage-to-absorption ratio of about
1 to 3. Brief studies of hydroxide
moderated reactors (including KOH,
LLiOH, NaOH, RbOH, and SrOH) show that,
except for KOH, the hydroxide moderated
reactors require low critical masses
and small core volumes for minimum
critical mass.

Measurements on the critical ex-
periment of the simulated General

Electric direct-cycle reactor have
been completed and the simulated cir-
culating-fuel reactor is now being
assembled (sec. 5). Evaluations, in
terms of contributions to reactivity,
have been made of several reflector
modifications of the direct-cycle
assembly. In addition, the data from
the earlier graphite reactor assembly
have been correlated with the data
from theoretical calculations of the
assembly. The correlation lacks
precision but gives results that are
at least consistent with the experi-
mental facts.

1. CIRCULATING-FUEL AIRCRAFT REACTOR

A. P. Fraas, ANP Division

A circulating-fuel aircraft reactor
system in which the fluid fuel circu-
lates directly through the turbojet
radiators was described in the last
report.{!) Other circulating-fuel
aircraft reactor systems, 1ncorporating

such features as 1intermediate heat

exchangers, various secondary coolants,
the use of liquid moderators, and
heavier reactor shielding, have been
considered in an attempt to determine
the most practical system for a func-
tional supersonic aircraft, ~All these
systems utilize the fundamental ad-
vantage of the bifunctional fuel-
coolant — the elimination of a heat
transfer stage within the reactor core.

~ Two series of shielded, full-size,
circulating-fuel aircraft designs have
been studied; one involves an annular,
or "wrap-around,"”" type of heat ex-
changer, and the other is a tandem
arrangement with the heat exchanger
behind the reactor. Analyses show
that the annular arrangement gives
the lower shield weight. These design
studies brought forth the important
technique of lacing the heat exchanger
matrix with about 8 vol % B4C to
keep the radiation from sodium or
NaK in the secondary circuit to
tolerable values even with something

~approaching a unit shield.

It also appears from these studies

that 1t would be advantageous to use
a liquid moderator such as water or
fused hydroxides. Not only would the
problem of cooling the moderator and
reflector be greatly simplified, but
by using perhaps a 12-in.-thick re-
flector, the problem of heating of the

pressure shell by gammas, neutron
captures, and inelastic scattering
would be greatly reduced. More de-

‘tailed studies of the practicability

of design for cooling the structure
with a liquid moderator have been
initiated.

REACTOR WITH TANDEM HEAT EXCHANGERS

The first basic configuration con-
sidered was one in which the reactor
core and the intermediate heat ex-
changer were placed in tandem. A
longitudinal section of a tandem re-
actor and heat exchanger arrangement
is shown in Fig. 1. A basic premise
was that by interposing the heat ex-
changer between the pumps and the re-
actor core, a uniform flowdistribution
among the fuel tubes would be assured.
The design required that the liquid
fluoride fuel flow through the tubes
in the reactor core at 11 ft/sec for
operation at 400,000 kw with a tempera-
ture rise through the reactor of 400°F.
The basic layout is best adapted to a
liquid moderator (i.e., H,0 or NaOH)
from the standpoint of fabrication and
of means for cooling the moderator
and reflector.

In this design, the fuel enters the
reactor at the top rear, makes a com-
plete loop through the fuel tubes in

.the core, and discharges to the heat

exchanger. The fuel tubes are of
stainless steel with 1 1/2-in. ID and
0.015-1n. wall thickness. If water
were the moderator, a double-walled
construction could be used. It may be
noted that if the inner tube (con-
taining circulating fuel) ruptured or
cracked, the only fuel lost would be
the amount that filled up the space
between tubes before it froze in
contact with the cold outer tube.

The water (or hydroxide) moderator
enters the active lattice around the

periphery of the rear of the reactor .

and flows toward the outlet at the
forward end of the reactor. As the
moderator flows in it is distributed
by a baffle sheet that is orificed

"to give the flow distribution required

by the power distribution within the
active lattice.

The control system for this proposed
circulating-fuel reactor design con-
sists of two curtains of cadmium rods
mounted on two endless tracks. The
curtains are moved from the reflector
into the active lattice by an endless

~chain-sprocket type of mechanism.

Each cadmium rod is mounted upon two
steel shafts with steel rollers attached
to the ends of the shafts. These
rollers are linked together to form
an endless chain. The sprocket 1is

driven by a worm-gear drive, which in

turn is driven by a hydraulic pump
mounted within the pressure shell.

Each cadmium rod is a cylinder ap--

proximately 1/2 in. OD by 1/4 in, ID
by 12 in. long, and there are about 50
rods in each control curtain.

REACTOR WITH‘A‘NNULAR’ HEAT EXCHANGERS

The second basic configuration
considered was a reactor with an
annular, or "wrap-around," type of
heat exchanger such as shown sche-
matically in Fig, 2. Radial webs are
used both to separate the annular heat
exchanger into sectors and to support
the shell around the outside of the
reflector. To permit assembly, the
reactor pressure shell would have to
be split axially, probably on the
center line. The pressure shell and
other structures are jacketed and

cooled by NaOH at around 1200°F, A

heat exchanger to cool the NaOH is
provided in the region where the NaK
enters the pressure shell. Although
not an essential element in this general

FOR PERIOD ENDING MARCH 10, 1952

!type of design, the concentric helical

coil carrying the NaOH moderator
through the reactor core is interest-
ing because it eliminates a header
problem. By using perhaps ten tube
fittings, welds at the ends of these
coiled tubes could be avoided so that
a material such as molybdenum might
be used.

REACTOR SHIELD DESIGNS

It is important to know the effects
of various parameters on the weight
of the aircraft reactor and shield,
but it 1s difficult to determine these
effects quantitatively since the pres-
ent knowledge of shielding does not
permit weight estimates closer than
+5%, at best. However, engineering
designs have been completed for the
shields for the preceding reactor
arrangements, and real weight differences
that result in lighter weight shields
for the annular arrangement than for
the tandem arrangement have been found
to exist. In the shield weights cal-
culated the use of B,C in the heat
exchanger and between the reactor and

" heat exchanger has been found to sub-

stantially reduce the activity of the
secondary coolant.

Design Procedure. The primary
objective in the design of these
shields was to minimize the activation
of the secondary coolant by delayed
neutrons from the fuel. This has been
effected by (1) attenuating the neutron
leakage from the active lattice to a
level below that of the delayed neu-

‘trons in the heat exchanger, and

(2) lacing the heat exchanger with
enough neutron absorbing material
(B,C) so that relatively few neutrons
would be absorbed in the secondary
coolant. The header sheet and a 5-in.
B,C layer between core and heat ex-
changer was sufficient to reduce the
neutron leakage flux to the heat ex-
changer, whereas the use of B,C in

every ninth tube in the heat exchanger
served to supress the activity of the
circulating fuel.

The balance of the shield design

work was straight-forward and followed
the procedures outlined by the Shield-
ing Board.(?? Both Lid Tank and Bulk
Shielding Facility test data were used.
The fission-product-decay gamma rays
for the equilibrium fission-product
concentration at full power were taken
as being equivalent to three 1.0-Mev
gamma rays and one-half of a 3.0-Mev
gamma ray per fission.

Activation of the Secondary Coolant.
The degree of activation of the second-
ary coolant is, of course, a function
of the materials 1in that coolant.
Since NaK (56% Na and 44% K) has many
advantages as a high-temperature heat
transfer medium, and since 1t would
probably be about as bad from the
activation standpoint as any coolant
that could be used, an estimate of its
activation was made with the heat ex-
changer shielded and laced with B,C as
outlined above. It was found that 1f

- 25% of the NaK in the system were

considered as concentrated at a point
and the self-absorption of the sodium-
decay gamma rays released in the air

radiator or other similar component

were assumed to be 50%, the dose at
1.5 meters (5 ft) from the center of
the source would be 200 r/hr after
long periods of operation at a reactor
heat output of 400,000 kw.

The activation of a quite different
coolant, a fused salt consisting of
approximately 60% LiCl, 30% MgCl,,
and 10% KCl, was also estimated. Al-
though with no B,C in the heat ex-
changer the activity of this fused
salt was only 5% of that of the Nak,
the activity for the case with the B,C
in the heat exchanger was 35% of that
of the NaK. Thus, it appears that
there is little to be gained from the
shielding standpoint in the use of
this molten chloride in place of Nak.

Shield Weights and Specifications.
Several engineering designs of shields
have been completed for both the tandem
and annular heat exchanger arrange-
ments. For either reactor arrangement
the divided shield resulted in the
lowest shield weight. However, the
desire to be able to carry out a
limited amount of airplane maintenance
work without special shielding argues
in favor of more shielding around the
reactor. The various shield designs
for the two reactor and heat exchanger
arrangements are given 1in Table 1.
For comparable shields the annular
heat exchanger and reactor assembly
gives appreciably lower weight than
the tandem arrangement.

R. W. Schroeder, ANP Division
E. S. Bettis, Reactor Projects Division

- The studies of the circulating-fuel
aircraft reactor using fused fluoride
have culminated in the design of two
aircraft reactor systems (one with and
one without an intermediate heat ex-
changer), both of which are potential
power plant systems for supersonic
nuclear propulsion, Furthermore, these
aircraft reactor systems appear to
permit higher performance than the
sodium-cooled reactor, primarily be-
cause of the bifunctional capacities
of the primary coolant, which is the
circulating fuel. Consequently, the
~ ARE to be constructed by the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory at Qak Ridge will
be a circulating-fuel type of reactor,

The circulating fuel of the reactor
will be a mixture of molten alkali
metal fluorides plus uranium fluoride,
- The structural metal of the core and
container shell will be Inconel, since
this metal has been on order for the
ligquid-metal ARE and currently appears
at least as corrosion resistant to the
circulating fluorides as any of the
stainless steelsor The reactor c¢an
advantageously be moderated with
beryllium oxide, which is also cur-
rently available for the previously
contemplated liguid-metal ARE,

The power is generated within the

circulating fuel as it is passed
through the beryllium oxide moderated
core. The core is provided with a
beryllium oxide side reflector, which
is housed with the core within an
Inconel pressure shell. The reflector
and pressure shell are cooled by a
separate circuit using a mixture of
nonuranium-bearing fluorides, Power
is abstracted from the fuel by means
of four fuel-to-helium heat exchangers
through which the fuel is circulated.

The heliumis cooled by passage through

four helium-to-water heat exchangers
and the water - the ultimate heat
source — is discharged.

Control of the reactor is provided
in three forms, (1) shim control, (2)
regulating rods, and (3) safety rods,
Shim control is achieved by varying
the uranium concentration in the circu-
lating fuel. One boron rod, which
passes through the core center lineand
effects approximately 0.75% Ak/k,

serves as the regulating rod. The
boron safety rods, equally spaced
about the.center of the core, have

approximately 5% Ak/k per rod.

CORE DESIGN

The core design is illustrated by
Fig. 3. It may be noted that the
over-all assembly includes an Inconel
pressure shell in which beryllium oxide
moderator and reflector blocks are
stacked and through which fuel tubes,
reflector coolant tubes, and control
assemblies pass. The innermost region
of the lattice is the core, which is a
cylinder 3 ft in diameter and 3 ft
long. The core is divided into six
60-degree sectors, each of which in-
cludes 13 vertical stacks of hexagonal
beryllium oxide blocks. FEach sector
includes one serpentine, fuel-tube
coil, which passes through the 13
moderator stacks in series, as 1l-
lustrated., The six serpentine coils
are connected in parallel by means of
external manifolds.

A reflector with a nominal thick-
ness of 6 in. 1is located between the
core and the pressure shell on the
cylindrical surface only. The re-
flector consists of beryllium oxide

blocks similar to the moderator blocks
but with}-in, holes for the passage of
reflector coolant, The reflector
coolant enters at one end of the
pressure shell, passes through the
reflector, bathes the pressure. shell
and fills the moderator interstices,
and exits at the other end of the
pressure shell,

Primary Coolant Circuit, Hydro-

dynamic and thermodynamic considera-

tions have influenced the design to
such an extent that a discussion of
these problems appears to be desirable
prior to description of the primary
coolant circuit itself, In a circu-
lating-fuel type of reactor, heat 1is
generated in the flowing fuel. The
particle heat generation is dependent
on the particle residence time within
the reactor., As the flow proceeds
through the tubes, the velocities
adjacent to the walls are lower than
the bulk mean velocities, so that the
fuel particles adjacent to the walls
are subjected to higher temperature
rises., 1Tlhis effect is mitigated by
convection within the fuel stream, but
a temperature difference will exist
between the wall and the stream
center line, Studies have indicated

~that this temperature difference is

directly proportional to the fuel
power density, tube diameter, Prandtl’s

~number, and Reynold’s number. Appli-

cation of these studies to various
postulated ARE configurations have
established that excessive temperature
differences are encountered in the

laminar flow region (Reynold’s number

below 5000) but that small temperature
differences are encountered in the
turbulent flow region. Consequently,
the reactor core was designed for a
Reynold’'s number of 10,000, thereby
allowing for some deviation of flow
rate or fluid physical properties.

The design for a straight-through
flow core arrangement was revised
because the calculated Reynold’'s

FOR PERIOD ENDING MARCH 10, 1952

number was less than 1000, Con-
sideration of the parameters for in-
creasing Reynold’s number indicated
that the desired correction would
entail increasing tube diameter, in-
creasing the number of tubes in series,
increasing the volumetric flow rate,
or decreasing the volume of fuel with-
in the core, or combinations thereof.
Investigation of these variables led
to the observation that a few series
passes would be required even with
maximum feasible exploitation of the
other variables. Since this was the
case, and since the design problems
involved in the use of many series
passes appeared to be similar to those
associated with the use of a lesser
number of series passes, it was decided
to use 13 series passes and avoid
compromising the volumetric flow rate
or the core fuel volume.

Secondary Coolant Circuit. The use
of a liquid circuit other than the
fuel circuit within the pressure shell
is desired for the following reasons:
(1) to maintain the pressure shell
essentially isothermal at a tempera-
ture of approximately 1150°F; (2) to
cool the beryllium oxide reflector
with a fluid other thanm circulating
fuel:; and (3) to fill the beryllium

"oxide moderator interstices and other

internal voids with a liquid maintained
at a pressure higher than the fuel
pressure to prevent a fuel tube leak
from adding reactive material to the
core, The ligquid to be used has to be
compatible with the structural material
under dynamic conditions and should
cause no undesirable reaction with
the fuel in the eveht of a leak in the
separating wall. At the present time
it is believed that nonuranium-bearing
fluorides, perhaps the fuel carrier
without the UF,, will best meet these
specifications,

The possibility of cooling the

moderator by positive flow of this
fluid through the moderator interstices

15

has been studied. Yt has been found,
however, that the mass flow through a
gapof constant periphery varies as the
third power of the gap width (in the
laminar flow region, with fixed
pressure drop), Temperature analyses
- with postulated gap width distributions
indicated that gross temperature
inequalities could exist throughout
. the moderator because of tolerance
accumulations affecting interstice
widths. Accordingly, it has been
decided to obstruct flow through the
moderator so as to render it virtually
stagnant. The moderator heat then is
conducted to the fuel stream, and thus
a relatively accurate analytical
determination of moderator tempera-
tures can be obtained.

Core Temperature Distribution. The
circulating fuel in the ARE core flows
in parallel through six serpentine
“tubes, each tube traversing the core
13 times. In passing through the core

13 times, the fuel is heated from
1150 to 1500°F., The calculated mixed

mean fuel temperatures at various

stations in the reactor are given in

There are two sources of heat for
the fuel circulating through the
reactor: 1nternal heat generation
(from fission and gamma-ray absorption)
and heat transferred to the fuel from
the remainder of the core. The heat
transferred from the remainder of the
core 1s produced in the following
manner. Heat is generated in the
moderator and the parasitic core
material as a result of gamma-ray
absorption, and additional heat 1is
generated in the moderator by neutron
slowing down. All this heat is trans-
ferred to the circulating fuel and
results in a temperature gradient
across the fuel, moderator, and
parasitic material,

EXTERNAL FLUID CIRCUIYT

The ARE fluid circuit, intended to
handle toxic and corrosive fluids at
1500°F, requires a considerable amount
of design and developmental effort.

‘Where possible, commercially available

components are used, but pumps, heat
exchangers, and certain other com-
ponents are being constructed es-
pecially for the ARE. The location of
the major system components, including
the reactor pits, the heat exchanger
room, the reactor, and the two heat
disposal loops, is 1llustrated in
Fig. 4. It may be noted that the heat
exchanger room is shielded from the
reactor pits to permit servicing after
fuel drainage and flushing. The

"shield was designed to minimize

activation of fluid circuit structure
by reactor neutrons during power
operation and to attenuate reactor
post- shutdown gamma rays to a level
permitting access to fluid circuit
components after shutdown.,

Pumps. The pumps to be used in the
fuel and moderator coolant circuits
are vertical-shaft, tangential-dis-

"charge, centrifugal pumps in which a

gas seal 1s used and the liquid level
is maintained. The gas seal is formed
by a floating graphite ring between

 the stationary nose on a bellows seal

and the hardened rotating nose on the
shaft. The primary pump seal carries
no appreciable pressure differential
and, consequently, requires that the
oil-circulating system above the seal
be pressurized to balance that of the
circulating system below the seal. The

‘circulating oil serves to cool the

shaft, bearing, and lower seal. In
addition, internal cooling of the
structure is obtained by the circu-
lation of helium. Another feature of
the pump is that the entire rotating
assembly can be put together outside
the pumping casing, and in event of

a failuqe it can be installed with
comparative ease,

ﬁeat Exbhangérs. The fuel-to-

‘helium heat exchangers are on order

with the Griscom-Russell Company; they
were designed by Griscom-Russell to
ORNL specifications. The heat ex-
changers are of the cross-flow type
with the fuel flowing through 1-in.-0D,
0.109-in. wall Inconel tubing. The
tubing is finned on the gas side with

'stainless steel, helically wound
" strips. Each heat exchanger includes

five parallel tube banks; each bank
consists of seven to nine horizontal
tubes in series with integral return

~bends. The fuel inlet and outlet

headers are constructed of 4-in. pipe

to which the five tube banks are
Weldedf

- The helium-to-water heat exchangers
also are finned-tube, cross-flow ex-
changers, but steel tubes with copper
fins are used.

Primary Coolant System. Fuel flows
from the six core tubes to a common
header, and a common trunk line conveys
the fuel into the heat exchanger room.
The fuel then divides into two com-
pletely independent loops, each

18

capable of dissipating 1500°F kw,
Within each loop the fuel divides into
two parallel 750-kw fuel-to-helium
heat exchangers and then passes through

a centrifugal pump to a common return

trunk (Fig. 4).

In an individual loop, helium flows
from a centrifugal blower through a
fuel-to-helium exchanger in which the
temperature of the helium is increased
from 250 to 750°F, The helium is then
cooled to 250°F in a helium-to-water
exchanger from which it passes through
another heating and cooling cycle and
is returned to the blower. This so-
called "double-sandwich" arrangement
permits two helium heat transports per
cycle and thereby halves the helium
flow rate required through the blower
and ducting for a specified power and
temperature rise, ' '

Secondary Coolant System. The
reflector and pressure shell coolant
system, as 1in the case of the fuel
system, is divided into two heat
disposal loops, each capable of
handling the load associated with
1500-kw reactor power, Heat 1is
conveyed from the primary coolant to
helium and then to the water sink,

Monitoring Circuit. All lines and
components containing fuel or reflector
cotlant are double-jacketed, with
helium passing through the annulus,
The helium pumping head 1is maintained
by drawing helium from the system,
cooling 1t, and admitting it to rotary-
type compressors at various poilnts in
the system as indicated. Monitoring
for fluoride leaks into the helium is
achieved by passing helium samples
through halogen detectors,

PREHEATING SYSTEM

The relatively high melting points
of the circulating fuel and secondary
coolant (around 752 to 932°F, depending

upon the particular fuel composition)
require that all equipment within
which these coolants are to be main-
tained be preheated to permit loading
and unloading,

"Reactor Assembly. The insulation

heat leakage at operating temperature
has been calculated to be approximately
15 kw, and the heat capacity of the
assembly has been established as
approximately 4000 Btu per °F. After
having studied various preheating
methods, including pumping hot fluids
through the fuel passages or through
the moderator interstices, it was
decided that the simplest method
entailed the application of electrical
resistance heaters to the outside of
the pressure shell, withheat transport
to the inner regions by conduction.
With a constant heat input of 14 kw,
in addition to the insulation losses,
it is estimated that the assembly can
be heated from room temperature to
1200°F in approximately four days.
With this heat input rate, certain
calculated temperature gradients are
as follows:

1. Across pressure shell, 20°F,

2. Across helium gap between shell
inside diameter and reflector outside

- diameter, approximately 100°F,

3. From reflector outside diameter
to core center line, approximately

250°F.

Ppiping. The heat capacity of the

~ piping is small relative to the piping
~insulation leakage. Consequently, the
power required to preheat the piping
"is substantially the same as the power
required to maintain it at the ultimate

temperature. If the liquid-bearing
pipes are empty, as is the case during
preheating, the pipe resistance to
axial heat flowis high, and the appli-
cation of heat to specific points on

FOR PERIOD ENDING MARCH 10, 1952

the pipe surface tends to cause large
temperature valleys to exist between
the points of heat application. By
attaching electrical resistance heaters
to the outer pipe of the double-

‘walled piping, however, the flowing

helium acts as a thermal conveyor and
facilitates axial heat transport,
Accordingly, substantially isothermal
helium contacts the inner pipe, and it
is thus possible to heat the pipe
uniformly.

Heat Exchangers. The fuel-to-
helium heat exchangers require pre-
heating prior to filling and the
addition of heat to compensate for
thermal leakage during filling or at
any time after filling when the fuel
pumps are inoperative. These heat
exchangers have a total of approxi-
mately 40 ft? of exposed free-flow
area (both upstream and downstream),
which, if allowed to radiate to the
adjacent cold structure, would dissi-
pate approximately 40 kw when the
tubes are at 1325°F. Accordingly, it
appears necessary to include radiation
barriers in the form of gates that can
be lowered during warm-up or zero- or
low-power operation, When these
radiation barriers are in position,
the fuel-to-helium heat exchangers are
enclosed and may be preheated by
means of hot helium supplied by the
external piping annuli.

ELECTRICAL POWER CIRCUITS

Because of the extreme incon-
veniences associated with forced
reactor shutdown, fuel drainage, re-
filling, and restarting, the objective
has been to design the system so that
no one failure will necessitate a
forced shutdown. Critical pumps,
blowers, etc. are duplicated, and each
set is served by an independent d-c
circuit that includes independent

19

T

buses, switches, and a-c-d-c motor-
generator sets, The use of direct cur-
rent for these circuits permits con-
venient speed control where required and
the use of battery sets floating on the
line to safeguard against outside
power failures. Alternating-current
instruments are fed from the d-c
circuits via d-c-a-c motor-generator
sets so that these instruments will
derive their power from the batteries
in an emergency.

- The heat capacity of the system 1is
large relative to the heat leakage
rate, so that no large temperature
loss will be incurred for about 6 hr
in an emergency. Consequently, it 1is
not necessary to use battery power for
system heat addition. System heaters,
therefore, are connected directly to
the 440-v a-c¢ circuit. Similarly, the
building crane and certain other items
will not need to be operative during
any short period in which it is neces-
saTy to use battery power, so these
components are supplied by the 440-v
a-c system. ‘ '

CONTROL SYSTEM

‘The ARE is controlled by three
essentially separate systems: (1)
regulating, (2) shim, and (3) safety.
A mechanical regulating rod is pro-
vided, since the time-constants of the
self-stabilizing effects of the fuel
expansion 1in the ARE are too long to
provide stiff control of the reactor.
Shim control is conveniently effected
by the addition of higher-uranium
concentration fuel to the circulating-
fuel volume.

Specifications for the control
console and panel have been released
with a specified delivery date of
October 1, 1952, The high-temperature
fission chamber has operated at 1292°F,
and an MIR-type servo for the regulat-
ing rod has been ordered., The kinetic

20

behavior is currently being analyzed
on the analogue computor.

Shim control.. Fuel enrichment will
be accomplished by adding enriched
molten fuel at the surge tank. The
molten concentrate will be introduced
through a small (%-in.) line, whach,
by means of a video pickup device, can
be observed from the control room
while fuel additions are being made,
The fuel-enrichment mechanism has been
laid out in elementary form. The
principles of operation have been
established, but the tanks, weighing
devices, valves, heaters, etc. have
not been detailed. This system 1is
much simpler than was first thought
possible and it makes possible a safe
and relatively easy technique of
bringing the reactor to critical after
the initial loading.

Regulating and Safety Rods. Because
of the low power density of the circu-
lating-fuel ARE, the temperature
coefficient of the fuel must be
supplemented by a servo-actuated
regulating rod if transient conditions
are to be controlled, This servo will
operate in exactly the same manner as
the fuel temperature coefficient. The
error signal that actuates the servo
will be a mixed signal of temperature
and neutron flux; it 1s given by the
equation '

€= (8, -6, ;) *58.5(p-py,

T

where
€ = error signal,
O, -6, ¢~ reactor inlet error in
OF,
(p - pO) = reactor power error in

megawatts (the factor
58.5 is in °F per mega-
watt).' :

 

 

 

 
 

 

i)

When € < 0 the servo withdraws the rod,
and when € > 0 the servo inserts the
rod.” This servo equation is different
from that previously reported as a
result of a change in reactor design.

A change has been made in the
location of the drive mechanisms for
the regulating and safety rods. They
will not be located over the reactor

pit, and they will have straight

linkages to the rods. This change
will allow considerable simplification
of the over-all mechanical control
system, |

An MTR-type servo has been ordered
for the regulating rod. The regulat-
ing rod and safety rod designs have
been determined and the fabrication of

" these rods has been turned over to the

Metallurgy Division. After fabri-
cation, the rods will be run in the
"cold" critical assembly to determine
their worth, Calculations indicate
that the safety rods are worth approxi-
mately 5% Ak/k, and the regulating
rod will be loaded so as to be worth
about 0.75% Ak/k. One safety rod
operating mechanism has been finished
by the machine shop. This assembly
has not been tested, but the design
seems to be satisfactory.

High-Temperature Fission Chamber.
The fission chamber has been operated
at 700°F but no insulator material has
been found that will withstand higher
temperatures. A design is in progress
that eliminates the insulator in the
high-temperature region. This chamber
has not been tested and there is no
certainty that 1t will function
properly. Because of the uncertainty
of high-temperature operation of the
fission chambers, sufficient cooling
is being provided to maintain the
chambers at 400°F, where it 1is known
they will function.

FOR PERIOD ENDING MARCH 10, 1952

Control Console and Panel. Complete
specifications for the components of
the control room have been released,
including detailed construction draw-
ings and fabricational and material
specifications., Sets of these specifi-
cations have been mailed to ten pros-
pective bidders, and the bids are to
received by March 1. The instructions
to bidders specified that the complete
order is to be filled by October 1,
1952,

The items covered in these drawings
and specifications include an operating
console, instrument racks, relay racks,
recorders for nuclear measurements,
amplifiers, power supplies, and
assorted mounting hardware, Items not
covered in this outside order are
nuclear chambers, some preamplifiers,
servos, and process instruments. The
order takes care of from 90 to 95% of
the electronic equipment needed for

the ARE.

Reactor Dynamic Computer. The
entire circuit of the ARE has been
put on the analogue computer, and
the kinetic behavior of the system 1is
being analyzed., The analysis is not
yet complete, but the work 1is pro-
gressing satisfactorily and indi-
cations are that a fairly compre-
hensive study will result from this
work, This computer analysis has
received the full attention of two
engineers for the past eight months.,

INSTRUMENTATION

A basic purpose of the ARE is the
acquisition of experimental data, so
the importance of complete and reliable
instrumentation cannot be over-
emphasized, Most ARE process in-
strumentation is intended to observe
and record rotational speeds, flow
rates, temperatures, pressures, oOr
ligquid levels. 1In the low-temperature

loops, this equipment is sufficiently

conventional to obviate the need for

detailed descriptions., The high-
temperature loops involve special
sensory problems, however, which may
merit some discussion, In some
instances several alternate sensory
principles are under development con-
currently, No attempt will be made to
describe each of these alternate
methods in detail in this report;
“however, the various technigues that
are being used or developed are out-
lined in the section on "Experimental
Reactor Engineering" (sec., 3).

BUILDING

The building to house the ARE is
proceeding on schedule., Additional
contracts have been negotiated with
the contractor to complete work not
specified in the original contract,
and this new work is to be completed
so that the building can be released
to OBNL by June 1, 1952. The auxiliary
power specifications have been com-
pleted and orders for the equipment
are being released. An elementary
electrical diagram for this equipment
has been drawn,

3. EXPERIMENTAL REACTOR ENGINEERING

H. W. Savage, ANP Division

Liquid metals, hydroxides, and
mixed fluorides are being investigated
as heat transfer media and fuels for
aircraft reactor experimentation at
temperatures of 1200 to 1800°F. Some
developmental effort on the use of
sodium and sodium-potassium alloy
continues, although the effort on the
technology of molten fluoride mixtures,
as required by the circulating-fuel
reactor, predominates. The develop-
ment of fluoride systems 1s limited
by the corrosion problem (see sec. 11
"Corrosion Research”). Chemical and

_physical treatment of fluoride com-

ponents to eliminate contaminants
and improving handling, storing, and
transfer techniques to avoid reintro-
duction of contaminants are being
studied as means of limiting corrosion.

The applicability of known methods
of pumping, sealing, controlling, and
measuring properties and quantities
of these high-temperature coolants and
fuels is being investigated. The high-
temperature reactor systems, however,
place unique restrictions on materials,
lubricants, leakage, and performance
of mechanical devices and associated
equipment. Pumping has been accom-
plished with conventional hydraulic
designs, but alleviation of thermal
distortions and stresses, cooling of
bearings, and the development of
liquid- and gas-tight seals have been
required. Alleviation of thermal dis-

tortions and the development of liquid-
-tight seals have also been required

for valves. 1In addition, the valves
must contain seal materials that will
not interdiffuse in the presence of
the coolant at high temperatures.
Lubrication of the moving parts of
these devices at high temperatures
has been accomplished. The cumbersome,
and at times massive, geometry of

these devices has made it necessary
to provide auxiliary heating to avoid
freezing of the coolant.

Heating and cooling of liquid
metals, hydroxides, and mixed fluorides
are being investigated from room
temperature to 1800°F. The high
melting temperatures of hydroxides
and fluorides have introduced pre-
heating, insulation, and operational
complexities, since 1t is desirable
to avolid freezing of the coolant and
possible bursting of containers upon
remelting. Heat transfer studies at
temperatures at which the materials
are molten thus far appear to be
straightforward, and the technology
advances at the rate at which the
controlling physical properties are
defined.

Equipment performance 1s improving
markedly, and a number of mechanical
and other devices for fluorides have
been operated for periods exceeding
1000 hr in some cases without visible
equipment damage and without leakage.
Heat exchangers are being designed
for aircraft and laboratory applica-
tion, and the NaK-to-NaK heat exchanger
has now operated for over 2000 hr at
1500°F. Flow, volume, pressure, and
temperature control appear to be
straightforward 1f care 1s exercised
at the high temperatures involved.

SEALS AND CLOSURES

Frozen-sodium-sealed pumps have
operated over extended periods, and
frozen fluorides that have been used
for sealing shafts show considerable
promise of giving satisfactory service.
The metallic braid with self-contained
packing lubricant appears to be highly

satisfactory for use with molten
fluorides. Controlled isolation of
two sections of a fused salt system
has been accomplished by the use of a
"freeze valve." Welded or metal-
gasketed joints are used in plping
systems. Improved weld designs and

welding techniques that allow full

penetration of weld metal have made
possible the operation of equipment
without failure for extended periods.
Flanged joint seals with oval-ring
gaskets have proved satisfactory for
operation at temperatures to 1300°F.
Frozen Sodium Seal. The frozen-
sodium-sealed pump regorted in the
last quarterly report‘!’ has operated

"approximately 1500 hr during this

quarter without failure of the frozen
sodium seal. A modified Durco cen-

trifugal pump has been constructed

that has a finned sleeve for forming
a frozen sodium seal by means of con-
vective cooling.

Frozen Fluoride Seal (W. B. McDonald
and P. W. Smith, ANP Division). An
additional 160 hr of testing was ac-
complished during this period with the
frozen fluoride seal previously re-
ported(?? (Fig. 5). 1Initial tests
were conducted to determine whether
a frozen fluoride seal 1s feasible,

and additional tests were conducted

to determine (1) the effect of fluorides
on the Stellite-coated shaft around
which the seal is formed; (2) the
maximum pressure that can be sealed
without leakage; (3) the problems
encountered in starting the shaft after
it has been stopped and the fluorides
permitted to freeze around the shaft;
and (4) the determination of design
and operational parameters with this

type of seal. These tests 1indicate
that greater clearance is desirable
between shaft and cooling sleeve than
was used in the frozen sodium seal.
A build-up of magnetic, metallic
material, from 1 to 2 mils thick, was
found on the shaft and cooling sleeve.
Several shallow surface scratches were
found on the shaft; however, these
were no more severe than those normally
encountered with stuffing-box packing
materials. A significant difference
was found between a frozen fluoride
seal and a frozen sodium seal; when
rotation 1s stopped and fluorides are
permitted to freeze around the shaft,
it is necessary to apply heat to the
shaft in order to free it for continued
operation. Maximum pressure limits
for this seal were not determined;
however, the seal was operated agalnst
60-ps1i pressure, which 1is satisfactory
for the operation of the ARE.

Bellows Type of Face Seal for ARE
Pump. Sealing of the ARE pump 1is
accomplished by two bellows type of
face seals installed in series. The
seal below the bearing space consists
of a graphite ring floating between
two hardened, metallic sealing faces,
one on the nose of the bellows and the
other attached to and rotating with
the shaft.

Sealing against the atmosphere 1is
accomplished by the conventional lapped
face seal above the bearings. This
arrangement permits the lower seal,
which must operate at higher tempera-
tures, to operate with no pressure
differential across it and thus
lengthens the life of the seal. This
arrangement would also permit complete
isolation of the system from the

" ambient atmosphere in the pump room

if leakage should occur in the primary
seal.

The temperature of the upper high-
pressure seal can be easily controlled

and should present no problem.  Any
leakage of bearing lubricant into the
system would be trapped immediately
below the seal and could be easily
removed from the system.

owing to metal and weld failures. A
stuffing-box seal for a valve stem
has been developed that will furnish
a positive seal against fluorides at
1500°F. Such a seal has operated
satisfactorily and has sealed against
fluid pressures to 50 psig. The seal
consists of a conventional type of
stuffing box in which successive layers

of Inconel braid, graphite, nickel -
‘powder, and another layer of Inconel

braid are packed under compression
around a shaft. A conventional stain-
less steel globe valve with the stem
packed in this manner has operated
during this period for more than 700
hr at 1500°F and 30-psi pressure and
is still in operation,

" The molten fluorides pump described
in the following is sealed with a con-
ventional stuffing-box arrangement by
using four rings of commercial-graphite-

impregnated asbestos packing separated
by Teflon washers. The washers are

machined from Teflon bar stock, since

it has been determined that sheet

Teflon formed by extrusion or rolling
processes has a "memory" for its pre-

extruded shape and at elevated temper-

atures tends to return to this shape.

~ The stuffing box is surrounded by a

cooling coil through which refrigerated
ethylene glycol is circulated.

Lubrication of Seals and Shafts
(H. R. Johnson, ANP Division). Tests
indicate that when the valve stem seal
described above is lubricated periodi-
cally (a few drops each week) with
tricresyl phosphate (a compound used
for lubricating wire-drawing dies),
friction is reduced to the point where
this high-temperature valve can be
operated with as little friction as a
standard valve operated at room tem-
perature.

Further tests show that when such a
gland is packed with Inconel braid and
finely powdered UF, is substituted for
the nickel and graphite powders, a

26

shaft can be rotated at 1000 rpm with
the entire assembly heated to 1500°F
with no damage to the shaft.

According to the Celanese Corpora-

tion of America, extensive tests indi-
cate that tricresyl phosphate has
approximately six times the film
strength of a lubricating oil of ap-
proximately the same viscosity. Con-
tinuous heating at well over 200°F in
in the presence of air is required to
bring about decomposition. "The lubri-
cating effect of tricresyl phosphate
on iron is believed to be due to forma-
tion of iron phosphide Fe,P."(37 A
valve stem lubricated periodically (a
few drops once a week) with tricresyl

.phosphate has operated 660 hr, and it

remalns very easy to turn.

PUMPS

Development of a mechanical pump
has progressed to the point where
reliable operation can be expected in
forced-circulation systems containing
either liquid metals or molten fluo-
rides with fluid temperatures in the
pump as high as 1300°F. Designs have
been completed, and fabrication of
pumps, which are expected to operate
reliably at 1500°F or above, is under
way. All pumps tested to date are of
laboratory size; however, pumps de-
signed to meet ARE flow and head re-

- quirements have been designed and are

to be fabricated.

ARE Centrifugal Pump (W. G. Cobb,
G. F. Wislicenus, J. F. Haines, and
A. G.Grindell). The ARE fluid circuit
consists of two pumps in the circu-
lating-fuel system and two pumps in
the moderator coolant system., The
head and flow requirements for each of

these pumps are 1dentical. Each must
deliver approximately 45 gpm with a
head of approximately 45 ft of fluid

‘pumped. Two models have been proposed

and designed for ARE service.

The ARE centrifugal pump, Model D,
requires a gas seal, whereas ARE cen-
trifugal pump, Model F, has a frozen
fluoride seal. The design features
of Model D were described in the last
quarterly report. The assembly of this
pump is shown in Fig. 6. The Y-12
shops are presently in the process of
fabricating three Model D pumps from
type-316 stainless steel. The Model
F frozen-fluoride-sealed pump is almost
identical to the Model D pump, with
the exception of the inclusion of a
gas-cooled section in which the fluo-
rides surrounding the shaft will be
frozen. The principle of the frozen
fluoride seal has been described in
the section on "Seals and Closures" as
well as in the two previous quarterly

~ reports.

Laboratory Frozen-Fluoride-Sealed
Centrifugal Pump (W, G. Cobb and P, W.

‘Taylor). The laboratory size cen-

trifugal pump described previously(*’

‘has been used to circulate molten

fluorides in an isothermal loop op-
erating at temperatures up to 1300°F
for more than 500 hours. Although some
shutdowns have occurred because of
leaks in the plumbing system, no indi-
cation of failure has been encountered
in the pump itself. This pump has
been modified to incorporate a Graphi-
tar, rotary face seal in place of the
graphite-impregnated-asbestos stuffing-
box seal, and the parting faces of the
pump casing have been moved to a point
above the liquid level in the pump.
These modifications are expected to
make it possible for this pump to

circulate fluids at temperatures 1in

excess of 1500°F.

Worthite Frozen-Sodium-Sealed Pump
(W. B. McDonald and W. R. Huntley).
The Worthite centrifugal pump modified
to incorporate the frozen-sodium seal,
testing of which was described in the
last report,‘'’ has been transferred
from an isothermal loop to operation
in a figure-8 loop. This pump has
operated for a total of approximately
1500 hr with no seal failure. Occa-
sional shutdowns for repair have been

caused by the mass transfer of copper

from the gasket used to seal the part-
ing faces of the pump to the shaft in
the cold section of the sealing annulus.
This resulted in a build-up on the
sleeve, which filled the annulus and
froze the shaft. The copper gasket
has been replaced by a soft nickel
gasket and the mass transfer condition
has apparently been remedied. Maxi-
mum sodium temperature in this loop
is 1500°F and the sodium temperature
at the pump is between 1000 and 1100°F.

During the total operating time no
difficulty has been experienced 1in
starting the cold pump from stand-by
conditions. As soon as molten sodium
is lifted from the sump to the pump
the shaft rotates freely. Some bear-
ing failures have been encountered
owing to the proximity of the bearing
housing to the high-temperature pump
casing. Further modifications have
been designed for moving the bearing
housing away from the pump and also
for furnishing better lubrication to
the bearings. Such a pump 1s expected
to operate at 1500°F.

Modified Durco Centrifugal Pumps.
Three Durco centrifugal pumps are
currently being modified for the forced
circulation of fluorides or sodium.
The sodium pump will 1ncorporate a
frozen sodium seal, and the two fluo-
ride pumps will be modified, one to a
frozen fluoride seal and the other to
a stuffing-box seal.

Construction is under way ona type-
316 stainless steel Durco centrifugal
pump having a conventional stuffing
box packed with Inconel braid and a
lubricant similar to that described
in the first part of this section.
The portion of the shaft passing
through the stuffing box is hard-faced
with a layer of Stellite 1/16-1in,
thick.

A Durco centrifugal pump (Model H

'34MDVX-80) made of type-316 stainless

steel has been modified to incorporate

a frozen sodium seal. The seal is
cooled by forced convection. The
lubricating oil for the bearings 1is
circulated through a cooling radiator.
This pump will deliver 45 gpm with a
head of 45 ft of fluid and is expected
to operate over a temperature range of
1000 to 1300°F. The modified pump is
being assembled in an isothermal loop
that has temperature measurement,
flow measurement, and control equip-
ment.

Forced-Convection-Cooled Sodium-
Sealed Pump. A type-316 stainless
steel Durco pump similar to that
described above has been modified to
incorporate a copper-finned-sleeve

frozen sodium seal that will be cooled

by forced-air convection. This pump
1s designed to be used for supplying
sodium at approximately 1500°F to a
fluid-to-air radiator for the opera-
tion of a Boeing turbojet engine. The
pump will operate at 3000 rpm and
deliver 50 gpm of sodium at 20 psig.
The temperature of the sodium at the
pump will be approximately 1100°F,

"pump for the NaK loop has been in-

stalled and operated for about 8 hours.
At present the pump motors. are of two
different types - a standard wound
motor and a motor with G-E Class H

insulation for 500°F operation. The

1000°F, Bentley-Harris, insulated
wire has arrived and is in the shop
to be wound. It appears that the No.
22 wire will fit in the existing stator
slots without enlarging the slots.

The loop was started with con-
siderable difficulty because of a
partial plug in the suction-line valve
seat. However, the plug was partly
cleared and the loop checked to tem-
peratures of 500 to 650°F by using the
newly installed cooler that feeds cold
metal back through the motors. Only a
slight rise above normal operating
temperatures for the motors was noted.
The pump was shut down when a leak
occurred at the discharge flange.

VALVES

In the construction of a plumbing
system for the forced circulation of
high-temperature fluids such as will
be encountered in the ARE, 1t will be
necessary at several points to 1in-
corporate valves that will operate
reliably in any emergency. Some of
these valves may be normally open or
normally closed and required to open
only once, whereas others may be re-
quired to open at more frequent inter-
vals. It 1is an absolute requirement,
however, that each valve incorporated
in the system perform its designated
function quickly and reliably at any
desired time during the entire Jlife of
the system. During this period empha-
sis has been placed on the development
of valves for such application.

Packing-Gland Seal Test Equipment.
Equipment has been designed and 1s
now being constructed for extensive
testing of the packing-gland type of
seal described above (see "Seals and
Closures™). Although initial tests
have produced a valve that appears
to be reliable, the optimum design of
such a seal, as well as the most

29

satisfactory packing materials and
lubricants, should be determined.

. Frozen Fluorides Valve (W. G. Cobb).
It has been determined in actual tests
that two sections of a high-tempera-
ture forced-circulation fluoride sys-
tem can be isolated from each other by
means of freezing a short section of
the connecting pipe. This frozen
section can be melted and operation
resumed at any desired time. Such a
valve, however, 1s not quick-acting.
Several minutes are required to either
freeze or melt the fluoride. It 1is
thought that a valve of this type used
in series with the conventional valve
described above would provide ade-
quate protection against leakage past
a valve seat. Such an application
would be the isolation of the dump
tanks from the ARE system. '

Ball Check Valves (D. R. Ward).
Specially designed ball check valves
(Fig. 7) have been operated to trans-
fer fluoride at 1400°F. The balls
were constructed of type-440 (passi-
vated) stainless steel and the housing
andlfittings were of type-316 stainless
steel. There was some slight evidence
of the balls sticking in the open
position, but in all cases increased
pressure or slight tapping of the
valve corrected this condition.

Valve Seat Test (A. P. Fraas and
G. Petersen). Zirconium and molybdenum

‘were recommended and tested as valve

seat materials because neither element
diffuses readily at high temperatures,
and zirconium does not readily alloy
with other metals. Both materials

" operated satisfactorily as valve seats

for 175 hr in sodium at temperatures
up to 1500°F. Metallurgical examina-
tion following this test indicated
that the zirconium was slightly at-
tacked but there was no evidence of
attack on the molybdenum.

HEAT EXCHANGERS

Heat transfer studies of the fluo-
rides and liquid metals indicate that
essentially conventional types of
heat exchangers will be applicable to
these systems once the corrosion prob-
lems with these fluids are surmounted.

The NaK-to-NaK heat exchanger has now’

operated for well over 2000 hr with no
apparent loss in performance. Other
heat exchangers have been designed for
aircraft application as well as for
use 1in other laboratory tests.

Aircraft Type of Radiator (J. F.
Bailey and W. C. Tunnell, ANP Divi-
sion). A literature survey of the
present fluid-to-gas heat exchangers

 

 

 

T T e T,

 

 
 

 

)

uty

indicated that some aircraft and loco-
motive radiators with similar require-
ments for space, weight, and efficiency
have been operated with the gas passing
through the tubes and the fluid flowing
through the interstices between the
closely stacked tubes. This has re-
sulted in a design proposed for a
fluoride-to-air radiator.

Preliminary calculations on the
basis of arbitrarily chosen dimensions
indicate that 1/2-in.-0D by 0.010-in. -
wall Inconel tubes flattened to a
rectangular cross section and stacked
in close contact with each other may
result in a desirable heat exchanger
configuration. Air will flow through
the flattened tubes and fluorides
around the tubes in the interstices.

. The advantages of the design appear to

be: (1) parallel (essentially) coun-

“ter-flowing fluids, (2) no serious

thermal expansion problems, (3) low
air pressure drop across the exchanger,
(4) low specific volume (in.® per
megawatt of heat transferred) of the
heat exchanger, (5) simplified fabri-
cation because all welds are exposed
for easy inspection and repair, and

(6) versatile tube spacing.

Sodium-to-Air Radiator (A. P. Fraas
and G. D. Whitman). The testing of the
high-performance, air-radiator, core
element described in the last report(®’
has not yet been accomplished because
of delays encountered in Nicrobrazing
the parts. The contractor who is
performing the Nicrobrazing operation
has promised delivery by March 10.

The forced-circulation sodium loop
for testing the performance of this
heat exchanger has been completed. The

loop is heated by I?R losses in the
piping. An air flow test of the core
element, which was made prior to the
Nicrobrazing operation, indicates that
the air pressure drop is approximately
30% lower than had been estimated for
the "cold" condition.

Fluoride-to-Fluoride Heat Exchanger
(D. Salmon). The performance of a
small shell-and-tube heat exchanger
operating with fluoride mixtures 1in
pure counterflow in a single-fluid
figure-8 system was investigated.
Tubing chosen for the study was 0.10-
in.-ID by 0.025-in.-wall Inconel, and
the parameters btaken were flow rate,
number of tubes, and length of ex-
changer. The results of the investi-
gation were plotted over a range of

- flows from 1 to 1000 1b/hr/tube and

for lengths from 1 to 10 feet.

Considering the limitations of

available heat sources and pumps, a
heat exchanger containing 52 tubes and
having an effective length of 1.5 ft
was analyzed using the above data. Its
performance 1s shown in Table 3 for
a constant heat input to the system

of 70,000 Btu/hr.

For obtaining heat transfer it
would be desirable to have the Reynold’s
number range extend well into the
turbulent region, and it is seen from
the tabulated data that the turbulent
region would be barely penetrated at
the highest flow for the heat exchanger
analyzed.

The main value of such a heat ex-
changer system would be for endurance
testing to determine the effect of
high-temperature dynamic corrosion and
possible deterioration of heat transfer
performance for a heat exchanger 1in
which small tubes and delicate fabri-
cating techniques are used.

NaK-to-NaK Heat Exchanger (A, P.
Fraas). The previously reported(®’
NaK-to-NaK heat exchanger, core ele-
ment consisting of 52 tubes 1/8 in. OD
has continued in operation. The total
running time has reached 2230 hr, over
2000 hr of which have been with a heat
exchanger inlet temperature of 1500°F
- and an outlet temperature of 1000°F for
the hot stream. The cold stream 1is
about 50°F lower at inlet and outlet.

- No apparent losses in heat transfer
- performance or increase in pressure
drop have occurred. The only diffi-
culty experienced after the 1initial
"shake-down" of the loop has been that
the accumulation of oxide in the header
tank became great enough after 2000 hr
to interfere with the operation of the
level control. The header tank and
filter have been removed, cleaned out,
reinstalled, and operation resumed.

Heat Transfer in Circulating Fluo-
ride Loops. A series of loops are
being constructed for circulating

fluorides at various rates to obtain
thermodynamic, hydraulic, and other
engineering data. The first loop uses
convection circulation and has been in
operation for 500 hours. The loops
are made of 1/2-in.-ips Inconel pipe,
heated by electric tube furnace ele-
ments, and cooled by natural convective
air over a coiled pipe section. By
means of a heat balance on the heater
section, flow rates, velocities, and
heat transfer coefficients are cal-
culated. Data derived from the first
loop, designated Model A-1, are given
in Table 4.

A natural circulation loop (desig-
nated Model B) has been designed to
maintain 600°F temperature difference
between hot and cold legs. The di-
ameter of the tubing between the hot
and cold legs 1s reduced to achieve
velocities of the order of 5 ft per
second. This loop, fabricated from
l1-in.,-ips Inconel pipe with a finned-
tube cooling section, will be heated
by electric tube furnace elements.
The loop is expected to operate with a
maximum hot-leg temperature of 1500
to 1600°F and a cold-leg temperature
of 900 to 1000°F. o

INSTRUMENTATION extended periods. The degree of ac-

Operation of a high-temperature
forced-circulation system with either
liquid metals or molten fluorides
necessitates maintenance of level in-
dication and control, accurate de-
termination of flow rates, and reliable
pressure measurements at several points
in the system. Since the use of most
commercially available equipment for
performing these functions is limited
to temperatures considerably lower
than the minimum operating tempera-
ture, an extensive developmental pro-
gram has been carried out to either
produce new instruments or remove the
temperature limitations placed on
existing instrumentation. Development
has now progressed to the point where
levels can be controlled in both high-
temperature fluoride and sodium systems
with great reliability for periods
extending more than 2000 hours. Al-
though equipment 1is still lacking for
the calibration of flow measuring
devices, means are now available for

curacy eventually attainable will
depend upon the procurement of ac-
curate calibration equipment. Pres-
sures are reliably measured at many
points in fluoride and sodium forced-
circulation systems with both com-
mercial and locally developed instru-
mentation.

Flow Measurement. Electromagnetic
flowmeters have proved to be very
reliable when used with systems cir-
culating sodium or other liquid metals
having good electrical conductivity.
With liquid metals it is possible to
measure toas high a degree of accuracy
as 1s permitted by the calibrating
equipment. In the case of fluorides,
which have very low electrical con-
ductivity, the prospects of using an
electromagnetic flowmeter are nil. A
venturi section with associated pres-
sure sensing instruments appears to be
the most attractive device for measur-
ing flow in a high-temperature fluo-
ride system because of the low head

33

loss. The extrapolation of water-
calibrated venturies to fluorides has
been sufficiently accurate.

Pressure Measurement. No pressure-
sensitive instrument has been developed
at ORNL or found commercially availa-
ble that will operate at the tempera-
tures encountered in the forced-circu-
lation systems. The highest tempera-
ture rating of any known commercial
instrument is 450°F. Consequently,
all pressure measuring devices have
used trapped gas, which results in the
pressure at the gas-liquid interface
being measured instead of that of the
liguid stream. However, this error in
pressure measurement can be minimized
by calibrating each set of instruments

-and associated gas traps with accurate

Bourdon tube pressure gages are

‘sufficiently reliable for rough pres-
- sure measurements but are not desirable

if a high degree of accuracy is to be
obtained. Bourdon tube gages, which
indicate_the”differential pressures
directly, are commercially available.

. Th? null balanéé typé of preésure
gages indicate differential pressure
on a single gage to the nearest hun-

- dredth of a pound per square inch.

Although use of this instrument 1is
limited by temperature, it was connected
to the hot liquid stream by gas lines
and was operated successfully with the
gage at room temperature.

Manometers have also been used to

‘measure differential pressﬁre. Al-

though they provide a reasonably ac-
curate measurement of the differential
pressure, these devices are more dif-
ficult to seal than the other systems
described and are therefore not recom-
mended for use with a trapped gas sys-

‘tem.

means of Chromel-Alumel thermocouples

and are recorded on multipoint Brown
temperature recorders. It has been
found that the accuracy of temperature
measurement depends to a great extent
on the fabrication and installation

~of the thermocouples. Two methods of

thermocouple attachment are being used:
(1) pulse-welding each thermocouple
wire to the outside surface of pipes
or containers and (2) forming a beaded
junction of the two thermocouple wires.
In each case the thermocouple is given
additional rigidity by tying it down
with nichrome wire. With either of
these methods a temperature error 1is
introduced if the thermocouple is not
insulated from ambient air or other
adjacent material. Borax has been
found to form an airtight coating that
prevents further oxidation.

Tests conducted with thermocouples
placed in deep wells centered in the
flowing stream and other couples
directly opposite on the external
surface of the pipe have revealed
that there is no more than a 15°F

temperature drop between the internal

thermocouple and that placed on the
outside. Thermocouples made by beading
the wires are accurate within +1°F.

The Brown temperature recorders,
with careful adjustment, will record
temperatures accurately within *1°F
over the full range from 0 to 2000°F.
They do however show a tendency to
drift after extended periods of opera-
tion, and cause errors of the order of
5°F. This necessitates frequent cali-
bration of the instruments; therefore
a program for routine inspection has
been set up, which should reveal any
instrumentation errors soon after
their occurrence.

Level Controls and Level Indicators
(A. L. Southern, ANP Division). Four

level indicating devices have proved

 

 

 

 
 

 

ry

¥

A

satisfactory for use 1in high-tempera-
ture liquids. The conventional probe-
type of level control operates a relay
or solenoid when the level of the con-
ducting fluid rises to short out the
probe. Such a level control has proved
most satisfactory both with liquid
metals and molten fluorides, although
in the case of liquid metals some
difficulty was encountered because
condensation on the spark plug in-
sulation shorted out the plug.

Another level indicator using the
principle of a resonant cavity has
been designed, and simulated experi-
ments indicate that this instrument
may give satisfactory performance.

The variable inductance level in-
dicator consists of a small coil wound
on the outside of the tank in which
the level is controlled and a tapered
iron core mounted on a float 1i1nside
the tank. The change in level raises
and lowers the tapered core inside

the coil and alters the inductance.

Tests made with the iron core at room
temperature demonstrate that it gives
a linear response that can be directly
correlated to a level inside the
system.

The fourth level indicator de-
veloped consists of a small tube ex-
tending to the bottom of the tank in
which the level is to be controlled.
Gas flowing through this tube bubbles
through the liquid. The pressure re-
quired to maintain a constant flow of
gas through the ligquid is directly
related to the height of the liquid

level above the end of the tube and is
measured by a manometer connected

between the gas tube and the gas space
above the free surface of the liquid.
Such an instrument can be used for

indicating and controlling liquid

levels.

HEATING AND COOLING OF HIGH-
TEMPERATURE SYSTEMS

Heating and cooling of liquid
metals, hydroxides, and mixed fluo-
rides are being investigated from room
temperature to 1800°F. Laboratory
methods of heating, some of which are
applicable to reactor preheating,
have 1included a variety of electrical
means, and gas heating ovens are being
installed. Cooling has been accom-
plished by liquid-to-liquid and liquid-
to-air heat exchange. Knowledge of
heat transfer properties, film coef-
ficients, and the effects of turbulence
is increasing.

Initial attempts at preheating
systems to be used in handling fused
fluoride mixtures melting between 800

‘and 1000°F resulted in an epidenic of

heater failures. Heating methods used
with sodium were studied and improved
to avoid overheating of heater elements,
and the insulation, which had been
chosen for inertness in contact with
sodium, was improved to reduce heat
losses. The heating techniques de-
scribed below, which were developed
for use with fluorides, are equally
applicable to hydroxides and liquid
metals.

External Heating Systems. Several
varieties of external heater units
have been tested in fluoride systems.
The different heat units included an
integral heater-insulation assembly
that can be prefabricated in the de-
sired shape, a flexible heater cable
that can be wrapped around the object
to be heated, and calrod heaters that
are specially constructed to have
greater contact with the surface to
which they are attached. The limiting
temperature of these heaters is de-

termined by the heater elements and

varies from 1250 to 1800°F, depending
upon the desired lifetime.

ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

The integral heater-insulation
assembly, which can be prefabricated
in a variety of sizes, consists of a
conventional clamshell tube furnace
element inserted into and attached to
preformed insulation by means of
clamps. This assembly has resulted in
a substantial saving of installation
time as well as in reduced heat loss
to the ambient air. The heaters have
operated more than 500 hr with

" filament temperatures at 1800°F without
becoming detached from the insulation.

Heaters of this type are preferred
when assembly time is at a premium.

A fléxiblévheater cable that can
be tightly wound on surfaces of com-

.plex geometry has been used to obtain

contact heating and reduction of
heat-up time. The heater, consisting
of nichrome wire covered with a double

. layer of fiberglass tubular insulation,

has been used successfully with fila-
Nichrome
wire commercially covered with this
insulation has been procured and 1is
being tested. This thin insulation is

. superior to other types of insulation,
‘such as ceramic beads, since the wire

can be more closely wound on the surface
to be heated and the temperature drop
from heater wire to heated surface is
considerably lower.

Dies have been constructed for
flattening the tubular calrod heaters
to give greater contact with the pipe
to which they are attached. As modi-
fied, one side of the heater 1s shaped
to conform to the curvature of the

pipe for nearly the full length of
. the heater.

4 Care must be exercised in
such shaping since it decreases the
volume of the heater that contains the
magnesium oxide insulation and results
in heater filament relocation and
distortion and subsequent hot spots
in operation.

36

Induction Heating (A. L. Southern,
ANP Division). High-frequency heating
is advantageous and availlable as a
means for rapid heating of small com-
ponents. Megatherms producing 20 kw
of power at 220 kc have been modified
with water-cooled coi1ls to obtain
temperatures over 1500°C. This method
of heating is uniform when the ma-
terial to which heat is applied is of
symmetrical geometry. On complex
surfaces, however, that section closest
to the coil is heated as much as 200°C
higher than the rest of the material.
The power producing equipment 1is

readily adaptable toheating components

containable in a space up to 24 1in.
in diameter and length.

Resistance Heating (R. G. Affel,
ANP Division). The generally appli-
cable method for rapid heating of
equipment appears to be direct resist-
ance heating. This type of heating is
superior to other types, in cases
where applicable, since the heat 1is
generated internally at the point
where it is desired and heat conduc-
tion by means of air or other gas 1is
eliminated. Direct resistance heating
has been used successfully for heating
sections of pipe where freezing would
be critical and for preheating thermal-
convection loops 1n preparation for
the filling operation. Sections of
l-in.-ips pipe 6 ft long have been
heated to 1500°F and convection loops
to 2000°F, for the purpose of cleaning
with hydrogen-firing. Heating rates
of the order of 100°F/min may be ob-
tained. The uniform heating obtained
and the elimination of heater failures
make this method of heat application
attractive,.

Insulation Testing (R. G. Affel,
ANP Division). The most satisfactory
insulation for use with sodium and
sodium-potassium alloy has proved to

be the lead-mill slag-wool type be-
cause of its relative inertness when
in contact with these liquids at high
temperatures. For fluorides, however,
the chemicals themselves are rela-
tively inert and the insulation 1is
only required to be nonoxidizing and
nonexplosive when suddenly placed in
intimate contact with the high-tempera-
ture liquid. However, with fluorides
it was found necessary to reduce heat
losses through insulation to alleviate
overheating of heater elements, and
Johns-Manville "Superex" insulation,
rated for 1900°F service, was used
since it 1is available in preformed
shapes to cover standard pipe sizes.
This new insulation has reduced the
insulation surface temperature on

1500°F thermal-convection and forced-

circulation loops from 400°F for the
lead-mill slag to an average of 200°F
for the Johns-Manville "Superex" in-
sulation.

ARE Core Preheating (D. F. Salmon,
ANP Division). The effectiveness of
various methods of preheating the ARE
core 1s being examined analytically
and by test. The most promising pre-
heating methods are believed to be:

1. Electric resistance elements ap-
plied directly to the outside of
the pressure shell,

2. Circulation of a high-temperature
gas or liquid through the coolant
tubes or core 1interstices,

3. Cyclic charging and dumping of the
actual reactor coolant, heating
the fluid between cycles, and
utilizing a portion of the tempera-
ture excess above its freezing
point. '

The test vehicle woﬁld be a fhll-éize

singly or in combination and core tem-
perature vs. time for varying quanti-
ties of heat input recorded, in order
to determine actual requirements and
to galn operating experience.

In the course of the investigation
a graphical solution of the transient
heating of a hollow cylinder of beryl-
lium oxide with a constant flow of
helium at 1500°F inside the cylinder
was made. A thermal diffusivity con-
stant of 0.186 ft?/hr for beryllium
oxide was assumed, and an effective
internal heat transfer coefficient of
25 Btu/hr ft?+°F was used. The solu-
tion indicated that the time required

to reach an outer beryllium oxide

surface temperature of 1200°F with the
above conditions is approximately 40
minutes. The low heat capacity of
helium gas would obviously be the con-
trolling factor for preheating time
and would greatly increase the time
required.

TECHNOLOGY OF HIGH-TEMPERATURE LIQUIDS

The successful operation of equip-
ment containing liquid metals, fluo-
rides, and hydroxides at high tempera-

tures 1s largely dependent upon purity

of the fluid sample and cleanliness of
the ultimate container. Attainment of
the desired purity of the fluid will
require close monitoring of each fluid
batch from the time it 1is prepared
until 1t 1s sealed in its container
and the development of special equip-
ment for the preparation, storage,and
transfer of the various fuel mixtures.
Similar precautions must be taken to
ascertain the cleanliness of fluid
containers, and degreasing, pickling,
hydrogen-firing, and electrolytic
cleaning may be involved.

eutectic fluoride mixtures, Table 5,

"niques specified by the Materials

Chemistry Division. For most of these
batches, the mixed components were
liquified in an 1nert atmosphere in
the presence of stainless steel and
Inconel chips at 1800°F to remove some
of the objectionable contaminants.
They were subsequently stored solid
or transferred for use in the molten
state under helium or argon gas pres-

simply forcing the fluid through a
frangible diaphragm located between
the two chambers. The pretreatment
consists of heating the fluorides to
1800°F for several hours in the presence
of stainless steel and Inconel chips
before filtering.

Storage and handling require that
the fluorides are not recontaminated
and that they are contained in simple
equipment in suitable physical condi-
tion for handy use. These require-

Sampling and Analyzing Techniques
(J. P. Blakely, Materials Chemistry
Division). A molten fuel sampler has
been designed, constructed, and used
successfully to obtain a sample of
molten fuel during the filling of a
convection loop. The sampler con-
sists of a heavy-walled, 100-cc,
graphite crucible held between two
metal plates with necessary transfer
and gas lines attached. The sampler
can be used either independently of
or in conjunction with the actual
filling of a loop.

Another sampler has been designed
that will make possible repeated

“sampling of a system that is in opera-

tion. When in use, molten fuel will
continuously drip through the sampler
and the sample container can be moved
as desired to intercept the drops.

Analysis of the individual fluo-
rides and eutectic mixtures of NaF-

shown traces of oxygen, hydrochloric

out detectable diffusion through the

graph type of helium leak detector,
sensitive to 1 part in 3.5 million,
was employed in this test.(3)

Cleaning and Inspection Technigques
(L. A. Mann and D. R. Ward, ANP Divi-
sion). Metal components have been
receilved 1in various conditions of
cleanliness and soundness; therefore
inspection and cleaning specifications
for components and assemblies have
been established to eliminate struc-
tural defects such as crevices and
pits and to remove oxides and other
contaminants from metal surfaces. The
cleaning techniques include degreas-
ing, pickling, hydrogen-firing, and
possibly electrolytic cleaning. In
addition to these techniques, the use
of additional flushing solutions 1s
required when cleaning previously used
equipment. The cleanliness of internal
surfaces may be determined with a
boroscope.

The process used for degreasing
metal parts depends upon the type of
grease encountered, the completeness of
degreasing required, and the tolerable
amount of film or deposit that can be
left onor in the degreased part. Tet-
trachloroethylene appears to be the
most promising of all degreasers for

~these purposes and trichloroethylene

the next.

Following the degreasing operation,
pickling with HNO, has been established
as the most satisfactory general clean-
ing process fornickel, Inconel, Monel,
and stainless steel equipment. This
type of pickling leaves the metal

covered with what is thought to be
essentially a monomolecular layer of
protective (dgainst many corrodents)
oxide; otherwise, 1t 1s as clean as
possible. Oxides may then be removed
from the surface of these metals by
contacting the metal (oxide) surface
with very dry oxygen-free hydrogen
gas at temperatures of from about
1500°F for nickel to above 1800°F
for chromium. The hydrogen 1s dried
to a -40°F dew point by first passing
it over a palladium (or other) catalyst
at room temperature and then passing
it through activated alumina.

‘Electrolytic cleaning has also been
examined as a possible technique,
although inherently it has the diffi-
" culty of requiring properly shaped and
placed internal electrodes. Of the
various electrolytic procedures ex-
amined, only the anodic treatment in
phosphoric acid solution evidenced
the high degree of cleaning desired.

" In used equipment most of the fluo-

-~ rides may be drained out while molten.
However, a coating will remain that

40

is dangerous 1f radiocactive or toxic
fluorides are present. It has been
determined that some molten salts and
hydroxides will remove the fluorides
by flushing at temperatures above the
melting point of the fluorides, but
such a treatment is difficult and
could easily mask the surface condi-
tion by additional corrosion. Of the
several noncorrosive cleaning solu-
tions tested, tap water and water con-
taining 10 to 50% H,0, gave the best
results, the latter being perhaps
slightly more effective. However,
the results obtained amounted only to
softening the fluorides so that they
could be easily removed mechanically
by brushing or with high-velocity
water. :

Prior to assembly all metal parts
are visually inspected for surface
defects and cleanliness. Internal
surfaces are examined by use of a
boroscope that will reveal major in-
ternal flaws, scale, slag, etc., but
its effectiveness is limited by the
patience and thoroughness of each
individual inspector. ’

4. REACTOR PHYSICS

W. K. Ergen, ANP Division

. The statics and uranium investment
of the 350-megawatt circulating-fuel

aircraft reactor were described in the-

last report¢!? and at present are not
a major concern. However, the kinetic
behavior of a circulating-fuel reactor
introduces several new considerations
into a somewhat obscure kinetic
picture. Malfunctions that brought
an increase as large as 3% of uranium
into the reacting zone would cause an
average temperature rise of ~100°C if
a thermal expansion coefficient of
3 X 10°* per °C is assumed for the
fuel. (An example of this type of
mal function 1s the thrombosis effect,
in which a precipitation of uranium
accumulates outside the active lattice
and is suddenly transported into the
reactor.) In addition to the thermal
expansion of the fuel, direct nuclear
effects could yield a temperature
coefficient of reactivity whose sign
is not now known. The loss of delayed
neutrons from the active lattice,
caused by the circulation of the fuel,
has been previously viewed with con-
cern because of the damping effect
associated with the presence of these
neutrons in static-fuel reactors. It
now appears plausible, although not
yet proved, that the circulation of

‘the fuel itself acts as a damping

mechanism, and possibly as a powerful
one.

The kinetic difficulties are not
very serious for the ARE. The flow
velocities of the fuel are so low
that the control rods can keep up
with the possible entrance of excess
fuel into the reacting zone or with

the exit of poison from this zone.

 

(I)N. M. Smith, Jr., “Reactor Physics,”
Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Project Quarterly
Progress Report for Period Ending December 10,
ORNL-1170, p. 13.

Consequently, the negative temperature
coefficient of reactivity will not be
called upon to compensate for large
reactivity changes. The residence
time of the fuel in the reactor 1is
comparable with the longest delayed-
neutron periods; therefore a con-
siderable fraction of the delayed
neutrons 1s given off in the reacting
volume and is available for the damping
of oscillations. Since 1t can reason-
ably be expected that the uranium will
be returned to the U?3% stockpile,
the uranium investment 1is, within
limits, a minor problem, The work
on the ARE was mainly concerned with
specific design problems and culminated
in a fairly detailed study of the
specific design selected for the
feasibility study. The critical
mass of this design was 22.3 1b,
which led to a total uranium i1nvestment
in the system of 74 pounds.

CIRCULATING-FUEL AIRCRAFT REACTOR

The kinetics of the circulating-
fuel aircraft reactors are currently
under intense investigation. The
problems are the thrombosis effect,
direct nuclear effects, and fast
oscillations.

The considerable amount of fuel
outside the reactor could cause
mal functions to occur and bring an
excesslive amount of fuel into (or out
of) the reacting zone.. As presently
conceived, the main mechanism that
compensates for these reactivity
changes before any control rods can
act 1s the thermal expansion of the
liquid fuel. For thermal volume
expansion coefficients of 3 x 10°*
per °C, an increase by 3% of the
fissionable material in the reactor

41

 
 

 

ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

3

would call for temperature rise of
100°C. Actually, the temperature
rise would be somewhat larger because
at short times after a sudden increase
of fissionable material in the reactor
a temperature overswing occurs, and
at longer times the effective fuel
expansion coefficient i1s decreased by
the expansion of the fuel tubes.
Furthermore, the temperature rise of
100°C refersto the average temperature,
~and local temperatures may increase
somewhat more. All this limits the
allowable change in fuel concentration
"in the reactor to about 3% - a very
stringent requirement.

In addition to the thermal ex-
pansion of the ligquid fuel, direct
nuclear effects, such as adaptation
of the neutron temperature to the

fuel temperature or Doppler broadening

of resonance lines, could yield a
. temperaturé coefficient of reactivity.
~Should it develop that such a temper-
~ature coefficient is positive and of
' the same order of magnitude as the
negative temperature coefficient
resulting from fuel expansion, then
the circulating-fuel ANP reactor
would be almost impractical. However,
it is hoped that the direct nuclear
effect can be made to yield a negative
temperature coefficient of reactivity
once these effects are well under-
stood. A negative temperature coef-
ficient would aid the fuel expansion
effect. A strenuous effort is being
made to investigate the temperature
coefficient of reactivity resulting
from direct nuclear effects. This is
a very difficult problem and in its
full extent is somewhat novel. No
reportable results have been obtained
thus far,

In conventional reactors, any
oscillations of periods that were
short compared with control rod action
times would be very effectively damped
out by delayed neutrons. The circu-
lating-fuel reactor loses a large

42

fraction of 1ts delayed neutrons in

the volume exterior to the reacting
zone, and at the beginning of this
quarter considerable concern existed
as to the possibility of undamped or
increasing oscillations. This concern
has been greatly alleviated by the
reasoning given below, in which 1t 1is
shown that 1t is plausible that the
circulation of the fuel 1tself will
act as a damping mechanism, and
possibly as a powerful one,

'The uranium investment of circu-
lating-fuel reactors is at present not
a major concern, However, an in-
vestigation of the use of low-assay
uranium (say 10% U%2%) is planned,
but no work has been completed thus
far. '

effect of the circulation of the fuel.
It appears likely that the circulation
of the fuel itself acts as a damping
mechanism. It should be emphasized
that the following réasoning does not
constitute a rigid proof and that
there is not yet any quantitative
measure of the damping effect of the
fuel circulation. Furthermore,
antidamping as a result of coupling
between mechanical and nuclear oscil-
lations is still a possibility. The
following simplifying assumptions
were made for this analysis of the
circulating-fuel reactor kinetics:

1. All particles of the fuel
spend the same time, £, in the reactor.

2. The flux and power distri-
butions are constant over the reactor
so that the temperature rise of a
fuel particle during a time interval
dt is proportional to the total reactor
power P(t) and the proportionality
constant € 1s independent of spatial
coordinates, and so that a temperature
changeof an element of fuel influences
the reactivity to an extent that is

independent of the position of the
element.

3. Delayed neutrons are neglected.
4. A change AT of the average fuel
temperature, 1, causes an instantaneous

change ~oAT in the reactivity.

5. The reactor inlet temperature
i1s constant.

The equations used are

In addition to the symbols already
specified, 7 is the prompt generation
time, P and T are functions of the
time t; and T is the deviation of the
average fuel temperature from the
value that gives zero excess re-
activity.

With these simplifying assumptions,
Egq. 1 1s equivalent to the first of
Egs. 1 in an HRP quarterly report.¢?’
Equation 2 can be understood by
considering that T changes during a
time element dt for two reasons: 1t
increases by €Pdt as a result of the
power input and it decreases because
hot fuel is expelled from the reactor.
(This explanation would be very simple
1f T were defined as the excess of
the temperature over the constant
reactor inlet temperature. Such a

‘definition of T would differ from the

one used here only by an additive
constant that disappears 1f the time

derivative T is formed.) The decrease
is proportional to the fuel outlet
temperature, which i1s € times the
integral of the power over the time
the expelled fuel spentin the reactor.
The factor 1/6 is used because the
temperature of the expelled fuel
influences the average temperature
T only to the extent of the ratio of
the volume of the expelled fuel to
the total volume of fuel in the re-
actor; for the fuel expelled during
dt this ratio is dt/6.

By dividing Eq. 1 by P, differ-
entiating twice with respect to ¢,
substituting T from Eq. 2, and differ-
entiating again with respect .to t,
the following equation 1s obtained:

This third-order, non-linear,
differential-difference equation has,
evidently, a simple solution if P(t)
happens to be periodic with the period
&/n, where n is a whole number. This
special case occurs, of course, only
if € has a specific relation to the
parameters determining the period of
osciliation (a€/7, and the amplitude
and average value of P). 1Ia the
special case the solution turns out
to be 1dentical with the well-known

easy to visualize: 1f each particle

there are no antidamped oscillations.

In the nonlinear case, the following

this discrepancy between the vanishing

Slow Kinetic Effects. (%’ Slow
kinetic effects are those that occur
in times of 1 sec or longer. These
effects are not a major worry because
of the possibility of compensating
for them by control rods and servo
mechanisms. Hence, the slow effects

cally for the aircraft reactor.

the Inconel structure was assumed to
occupy 2% of the reactor volume
(instead of 1.5% as in the last re-

changes was a small decrease in
critical mass. Using beryllium metal
instead of beryllium oxide as a

‘moderator would reduce the critical

mass by only 6.5%. The fuel self-
shielding corresponds to changes
Ak of 2.2 and 5.8% for 1-in.-ID and

ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

ALKALI HYDROXIDE MODERATED REACTOR(?)

In continuation of the work on
circulating-moderator reactors re-
ported in the last quarterly report, (%)
the critical masses plotted in Fig. 11
as functions of core diameter were
computed by the bare-reactor multigroup
method. A thick hydroxide reflector
was assumed, the cross section of
uranium and the hydroxides only were
included (thus neglecting the poisoning
by structures, etc.), and the following
density values (in g/cc) were used:
[LiOH = 1.21, NaCH = 1.61, KOH = 1.59,
hbOH = 2.9, Sr(OH), = 3.4. All curves
would show minimums 1f extended to
lower reactor volumes. The large
critical masses for potassium hy-
droxide result from the large ab-
sorption and small scattering cross
section of potassium, and these cross
sections also explain the moving of
the minimum to large core volumes,
Except with potassium hydroxide, the

hydrogen moderation results in small

critical masses.

SURVEY CALCULATIONS OF TiHE
'CIRCULATING-FUEL ARE

C.B. Mills, ANP Division

At the beginning of this quarter, a
survey calculation was carried out(!??

on the circulating-fuel ARE. The main
variable was the vbyume fraction
occupied by the fuel-coolant. Although

this fraction varied from 6.85 to
22.4%, the total uranium investment
(assuming 6.8 ft® of fuel external to
the reactor) varies only from 41 to
43 1b and goes through a flat minimum
of 40 1b around a value of 15% for

this fraction. The per cent thermal
fission decreases from 83 to 67, as
the fuel volume fraction increases
over the above range. The most recent
version of the ARE has a small (7.60)
volume per cent of fuel-coolant circu-
lating in a series-parallel piping
arrangement. Critical mass, reactivity
coefficients, and other numbers of
design interest for the circulating-
fuel ABE are presented.

A specificARE design, now obsolete,
was investigated('!) prior to the work
on the ARE design presented here.

ARE Core Design. The cross section
of the circulating-fuel ARE core
normal to the axis consists of 82
hexagons of beryllium oxide with
central holes for 78 fuel tubes and
4 control rods. The fuel tubes are
1.235 OD and have 0.060-in. wall
thickness. The core length 1s 35.25
in., and the ends of the core are bare.

The reflector i1is composed of
hexagonal blocks of beryllium oxide
with 57 central cooling holes con-
structed to build out the core plus
reflector to a right cylinder with a
diameter of 47.750 inches. A 2-in.-
thick Inconel pressure shell with 48
in. ID, 52 in. OD, and 48.50 in.
in length encloses the core and re-
reflector assemblies.

The fuel-coolant volume 1in the
heat exchanger and the plumbing outside
the reactor is 4.4 ft3 (does not
include 0.2 ft® in tube bends at the
reactor ends). The total core volume
is 20.42 ft®, so there is 1.55 ft® of
fuel in the core. The ratio of fuel
in the core to total fuel is 0.26.
Volume fractions of the core and
reflector, as used in the design
calculations, are given in Table 6.

from bare(!?) and reflected(!®) reactor

critical mass is arrived at by a
series of approximations in which the

The reflected reactor has

to-absorption ratio of about 1 to 3.

_ Reactivity Coefficients. The
values of the reactivity coefficients,
summarized in Table 8, were obtained
by bare reactor calculation meth-
ods.(12:13) These methods appear
justified, since the corresponding
bare reactor calculation for critical
mass gave keff 1.054 for 15 1b of
uranium, which 1s close to the value
of keff = 1.0398 for the reflected
reactor. However, the reflected
reactor calculations for Ak/k per °F
gave -0.64 x 10-%, so -that the actual
reactor (whose surface 1s 13.92/41.39
bare and 27.47/41.39 reflected) would
have a Ak/k per °F of -1.95 x 10°°

For the change Ak/k corresponding to

ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

Neutron flux normalized to 1
fission/cc/sec was computed to be
364 for the monthermal neutrons and
80 for the thermal neutrons in this
reactor. At full power, 3 megawatts,
the total integrated flux in the
center of the reactor is 16.7 x 10'3
neutrons/sec/cm?. The thermal flux

is 3.0 x 10'% neutrons/sec/cm?, and

the fast flux 1is 13.7 x 10!'% neu-

at three points in the reactor are
given in Fig. 15. The important
difference 1s that of amplitude.
Note that high-energy neutron flux
is relatively somewhat higher toward
the reactor center, but the difference
is small. Figure 16 shows the corre-

.sponding plots of flux vs. radius for

four energies. The importance of
moderation by the reflector 1s quite
apparent.

STATICS OF ARE CONTROLS

Static calculations of the various
mechanisms for the regulation, safety,
and shim control of the circulating-
fuel ARE are given in terms of changes
in reactivity. The one boron carbide
regul ator rod, fully inserted, effects
a net change 1in reéctivity_of 0.0075.
The three safety rods each effect a
net change in reactivity of 0.053.
Details of the operation of these
control mechanisms are given in sec. 2.

mated reactivity changes, Ak/k, f

SPECIFIC DESIGN PROBLEMS OF THE
CIRCULATING-FUEL ARE

Dumping all the ARE fuel into a
single tank does not result in a
critical mass in the tank. The
assumptions pertinent to this con-
clusion are given in Ref. 14; the
most i1mportant assumption 1is the
absence of good moderators in or near
the tank. '

Two ARE designs with volume frac-
tions of fuel in the core of 6.85 and
22.5% were compared as to the sensi-
tivity of their critical mass to the
addition of potassium (which has a
large absorption cross section) to
the fuel mixture.¢ %) Of importance

during the discussion was whether
the existing beryllium oxide blocks
should be cut to accommodate the
larger fuel percentage. For the
6.85% design, increaseof the potassium
fluoride mole fraction in the fuel
from 0 to 60% increased the critical
mass by 55%. For the 22.5% design,
the corresponding increase was 105%.
Since the use of potassium may be
necessary, the large sensitivity of
the 22.5% design to potassium works
to the disadvantage of this design.

The power generation in a boron
carbide curtain on one end of a
3 -megawatt ARE reactor was found to
be 0.53 watts/cm?, 20% of which is
developed in the first 0.05 centi-
meter.¢1%)

The problems of fuel-tube-wall
corrosion may not be completely
solved by the time the ARE is being
built, and for this reason, as well
as for reasons of fabrication, 1t 1s
highly desirable to use thick tube
walls. Under assumptions specified
in the reference,{!”’? increasing the
tube wall thickness from 20 to 40 or
60 mils increases the critical mass

by 18.5 and 43%, respectively.

A, D, Callihan,

The group responsible for studies
of preliminary reactor assemblies has
continued investigations during the
past quarter with the mockup of the
G-E, direct-cycle reactor described in
the preceding report.{(1) Relative
evaluations, in terms of contributions
to reactivity, have been made of
several reflector modifications., Data
obtained several months ago from a
critical assembly of uranium and
graphite have been analyzed, and
preliminary plans for experiments on
the liquid-fuel-coolant aircraft
The data from
the graphite assembly have been corre-
lated with the theoretical calculations
of the assembly. The correlation
lacks precision but gives results that
are at least consistent with experi-
mental fact. |

in the development of the direct-
cycle nuclear reactor for aircraft
propulsion, A loading chart of this
assembly is shown in Fig, 17. During
this quarter temperature effects on
reactivity have been studied, and some
comparisons have been made of the
effect on reactivity of the beryllium
reflector and of varying relative
thicknesses of stainless steel and
plastic substituted for the beryllium.
A control rod calibration was made,
and although the data obtained are
unique to the direct-cycle reactor,
they are of value for other types of
reactors, since they indicate the
method and precision of evaluating
reactivity changes introduced by
changes in reflector, structural
elements, and other components,

Control Rod Calibration. The
change in reactivity introduced by
displacement of each control rod has
been determined by two methods. In the
first, the "period" method, a measure-
ment 1s made of the period of the
supercritical system resulting from
the insertion of a control rod, and
the corresponding change in reactivity
is determined. In the second, the
"rod-drop" method, a safety rod is
evaluated from the transient occurring
in the flux as the safety rod is
rapidly removed from the assembly.
Since each control rod is practically
coaxial with a safety rod (Fig. 17),
the over-all value of corresponding
rods is taken to be equal.

A comparison of the total rod
calibrations obtained from the rod-
drop method with the integrated value
from the period measurements 1is given
in Table 10. Changes in reactivity
are expressed in "cents," where 100
cents ("one dollar™) is equivalent to

Reflector Studies. An experiment
was initiated before the reactor was
in final form to compare the reactivity
value of a reflector element with that
of a fuel element to ascertain the
most satisfactory location of the
safety rod. A section of the beryllium
reflector 22 in., long (one-half of the
44-in. total reflector jacket length)
was removed from positions M-21, V-11,
and W-11 (Fig. 17), and the resulting
change in reactivity was ascertained
by a calibrated control rod. The
resulting data (Table 11) give the
reactivity change (with an estimated
error of 1 cent) when a beryllium-
filled tube is substituted for an
air-filled tube,.

beryllium fluoride will be omitted from
the fuel for convenience in preparation,
One possible experimental variable will
be the uranium density of the fuel.
In the first experiment the density
will be that calculated for the molten
fluoride mixture for the ARE. Also
 

the powder mixture will have the same
uranium-sodium atomic ratio as the
design fuel. However, it will probably
not be possible to achieve the over-
all fuel density of the design fuel in
this mockup. Design of fuel con-
tainers and control and safety devices
is under way.

CORRELATION OF THEORY AND
CRITICAL EXPERIMENTS

D. K. Holmes, Physics Division

An attempt has been made to de-
termine how closely theory can be made
to check with results from critical
experiments., The several types of
results that are subject to theoretical
analysis include (1) criticality with
a nonhydrogenous moderator and with a
hydrogenous moderator, (2) foil ex-
posures, (3) danger coefficients, (4)
"rod sensitivity, and (5) the gap
experiment, ’

Although criticality calculations
for both hydrogenous and nonhydrogenous
moderated reactors are acceptably
consistent, the results could be
improved in the case of a beryllium
moderator by the existence of better
cross-section data, Multigroup calcu-
lations of hydrogen moderated reactors
yield high multiplication constants.
Danger coefficient data provide a
further check of the multigroup method,
and the cross sections upon which these
calculations are based agree reasonably
well, at least in the cases of iron
and nickel. Foil measurements also
show appreciable correlation with
predicted values. However, elementary
theory on the loss of reactivity 1in
the gap experiment is consistently

about 50% low.

Criticality with Nonhydrogenous
Moderators. Since considerable effort
has been devoted to setting up the
"multigroup" technique for numerical

FOR PERIOD ENDING MARCH 10, 1952

integration of the age-diffusion
equation,(*) a very definite attempt
has been made to determine whether
these calculations can predict experi-
mental results. Two separate bare
assemblies have been studied, one with
beryllium as moderator and the other
with graphite. Two assemblies are
described in Table 13,

The results of the multigroup
calculations on these two reactcrs are
given in Table 14,

- The values of k_ listed in Table
14 encourage the belief that the method
and the cross sections on which the
calculation 1s based are accurate;
however, these results are somewhat
offset by the calculations of the ages
of thermal neutrons in beryllium and
in graphite. Since both these calcu-
lations involve the same multigroup
method and the same cross sections,
the correlation with experimental data
would be expected to be similar to
that for the multiplication constants.
Table 15 shows that whereas the calcu-

lated value for graphite may be
acceptable, the calculated age for
beryllium is not acceptable, The

following possible explanations for
this discrepancy have been examined:

1. Incorrect experimental value
for the age,

2., Incorrect values for the beryl-
lium scattering cross section,

3. Neglect of p-scattering 1in
beryllium.

The measurements of the age in beryl-
lium seem to be in good agreement.
Changes in either the total scattering
cross section or the p-scattering

give the
age, when

lead to values for keff of around

0.90.

An additional complication is
introduced by the possibility of the
existence of a significant cross
section for the (n,2n) reaction in

beryllium.¢(5) Various experimental
estimates for this cross section may
lead to increases of as much as 20%
in the calculated k for assembly 1.
At present the best approach to match-
ing the calculations with experimental
data is probably that of allowing some
p-scattering to raise the calculated

age and also some (n,2n) cross section
to bring the k back to unity. In
the absence of reliable experimental
data on both points, such calculations
would be purely speculative. In any
case, 1t seems fair to conclude that
the method of calculation gives results
that are at least consistent with
experimental fact. '

Criticality with Hydrogenous
Moderators. A modified form of the
multigroup method has been used to
calculate the multiplication con-
stants for four critical assemblies
consisting of either bare or reflected
cores of solutions of uranium hexa-
fluoride in water. An extra term is
added to the usual age-diffusion
equation to take account of the
relatively large energy losses of the
neutrons because of scattering in
hydrogenous materials. Since the
reflectors, when used, were es-
sentially infinite and of water, a
simple, reflector-saving correction to
the bare calculation was used. The
results{(®) gave effective multipli-
cation constants ranging from 0.97 to
0.988 for the critical assemblies,
Since the reactors ranged from 41.5 to
94% thermal and a simple age-diffusion,
multigroup calculation gave effective
multiplication constants about 20% too
high, it may be expected that the
method of calculation will give
acceptable results, in general, for
hydrogenous reactors.,

Foil Exposures. It is possible to
calculate the activity of an aluminum
catcher foil placed against a fuel
disk, either bare, cadmium covered, or
cadmium-indium covered 1f the neutron
flux in the reglon and the uranium and
cadmium capture cross sections are
known as functions of energy. By
denoting the activations, bare cadmium

~ _Danger Coefficients. A further
check of the multigroup method and the
cross sections on which calculations

~are based is available in the danger

coefficient measurements, Experi-
mentally, the measurement consists of
determining the loss in reactivity
when a block of some material 1is
placed in the center of the assembly.
(The comparison is with a void of the
same size and at the same position as
the block of material; the experiments
were performed on assembly 4.) There
are two methods of calculation that
may be used to check these experiments,
In the "difference method," the re-
activityis recomputed for the assembly
using the multigroup method with the
proper additional amount of the
particular material added to the
assembly., [Since the material 1is, by
this procedure, essentially spread

66 , Q-

‘relatively small,

uniformly over the volume of the
reactor, whereas in the experiment the
material is concentrated at the center
of the assembly, the calculated
results are multiplied by (7/2)3 to
properly weight the importance of the
center of the reactor.] The new k

. . eff
is then compared with the old one
obtained before the introduction of
new material, Since the volume
fractions of the added materials are
this method involves
taking small differences of large
numbers; however, it is felt that the
numerical methods used are guite
adequate for this case, and the method
has the advantage of including the
scattering cross section and the & for
the added material as well as 1its
absorption cross section. The second
method is a perturbation technique
that involves the calculation of an
"importance" function(!) (of energy)
for the assembly. The perturbation
method allows the material to be
placed directly at the center 6f the
reactor but, as used for the danger
coefficient calculations, takes into
account only the absorption cross
section of the added material; thus
any gain 1in moderation over the void
is not included in the perturbation
method., 1In Table 17 the total loss
in k, upon introduction of a block
of the material of the size listed
into assembly 4 1s given.

An additional effect owing to the
lumping of the added material, which
would reduce the effective absorption
cross section, was not included in the
calculation; such an effect would
reduce the magnitudes of the numbers
calculated.

Rod Sensitivity. The control rods
for assembly 4 were typical sections

of the assembly., An experiment ,which

fitted the theoretically expected
importance function, i.e.,

where x is measured from the center of

the reactor, and v = /L, where L is
the length of the reactor. However,
the "typical-element™ control rod,
which does leave a 3 by 3 in. void

channel behind as it is withdrawn,
showed an entirely different behavior.
The sensitivity was fairly constant as
a function of x until the rod had been
withdrawn somewhat over three-quarters
of the total rod length, at which
point the sensitivity rose to a maximum
(about 20% above its value at the

center of the assembly) and then fell

rapidly as the edge of the reactor was

approached.

It seems fairly certain that the
removal of a block of moderator of
width Ax at a point x in the reactor
(leaving a thin void section behind)
should give a change in k_ 7 that
varies again as cos? Yx; tﬂus the

“peculiar behavior of the rod sensitivity

seems most likely to be the result of
the void channel, which is of length

(L/2) - x when the rod has been with-.

drawn a distance x. Thus 1t 1s
possible that a term provided by the
transport of neutrons along the channel
from near the center of the reactor to
a region of much lower importance near

the outside might account for the

where P(x’ - x") is the probability
that a neutron will make a flight

by a small area at x". I(x' — z") is
the change in importance of a neutron
while being transported from x' to x”.
Since the integral is over all values
of x' and x”, account is taken of the
gain in importance owing to transport
toward the center of the reactor, but
this will be smaller than the loss of
importance since the flux falls off
from the center as cos yx. Numerical
evaluation of the integrals shown
indicates that the void contribution
to the rod sensitivity rises from zero

at the center of the assembly to a

maximum near the three-quarter point

 Gap Experiment. With calibrated
control rods it 1is possible to measure
the loss in reactivity upon separating
the two halves of the reactor at the
center plane, Such an experiment was
performed on assembly 4 with sepa-
rations up to 0.3 in. and losses in
reactivity up to about 0.005. A calcu-
lation has been made by using the
mul tigroup method and allowing an
apparent absorption cross section at
each lethargy corresponding to the
probability for loss of neutrons from
the gap [with a weighting factor of
(7/2)% to account for the fact that
the losses are actually from the
center of the reactor]. The leakage
losses from the gap were calculated by
using the results given in CP-3443.(7)
The calculated losses in k& are
uniformly about 50% lower than the
experimental results. However, since
the maximum separation of halves 1is
only 0.3 in., whereas the dimension of
a face of the reactor is 51 in., the
entire experiment is in the range of
"small gap" for which the results of
CP-3443 are known to underestimate the
leakage from the gap. An improvement
of the method of CP-3443 has been made,
and the losses are now being recalcu-
lated on the new basis.

SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION

E. P, Blizard, Physics Division

The mockup of the divided shield is
now being measured in the Bulk Shield-
ing Facility (sec. 6). The angular
and energy-dependent gamma-ray measure-
ments that have been obtained are
gratifyingly detailed., It is not
certain that the neutron spectral and
angular distributions will be as
amenable to measurements; the in-
struments for these measurements are
sti]ll being developed,

Research on ducts has included
detailed measurement of the effect of
duct geometry on neutron transmission,
as well as the experimental corrobo-
ration of a simplified theory of
neutron transmission in ducts (sec. 7).
The agreement between theory and
experiment for duct transmission is
within a factor of 2 for attenuations
as high as 10°%., Duct parameters in-
vestigated include diameter, length,
and angles of a single bend,

A comprehensive design of the Tower
Shielding Facility, which will make

possible full-scale (but not full-
intensity) measurements of divided
shields has been completed (sec. 8).
The resulting configuration, basically
a 300-ft tower with a 100-ft cross
member for the reactor and crew shield,
meets all requirements regarding
freedom from spuriously scattered
radiation and flexibility. Tt 1s
estimated that this facility will
cost about two million dollars and
that it will be completed 1in the
middle of 1953.

Additional cross-section measure-
ments have been obtained on the 5-Mev
Van de Graaff and the time-of-flight
neutron spectrometer for use in reactor
cross-section measurements has been
completed (sec., 9). The spectrometer
has been installed and the counting
rates optimized and tested on the LITR.

Measurements of the total cross section
of 1ron on the 5-Mev accelerator extend

from 0.7 to 3.6 Mev.

Physics

The divided shield mockup, supplied
by the General Electric Company, has
been installed in the Bulk Shielding
Facility, For these measurements the
reactor was reloaded to completely
fill the lattice of the reactor and
to minimize the effect of the borated
water., The gamma-ray spectroscopy 1is
well under way, but instrumentation

required for the neutron spectroscopy-

will not be completed until this
summer. ‘

MOCKUP OF THE DIVIDED SHIELD

The divided shield mockup consists
of a tank cylindrical on the sides and
roughly hemispherical in front (Fig.
20). A vertical slot that barely
allows clearance for the reactor is
cut along the length of the cylindrical
section so that the reactor and its
supporting bridge may be moved back
out of the shield. Cylindrical air
voids on the sides provide a region of
no attenuation for neutrons and gamma
rays. This has the effect of simulat-
ing a reactor 4 ft in diameter and
extending out to the walls of the air
voids. Mounting brackets are provided
to hold two, large, roughly hemispheri-

cal, lead dishes that can be installed

to mockup the lead shadow shield.
These lead dishes are not being used
for the present experiments. '

For the éxperiments now under way
the shield has been filled with borated
water (0.4 wt % boron), and all

Division

measurements are being taken along the
center line out from the front face of
the reactor, as follows:

1. Center line measurements of
thermal-neutron flux, fast-neutron
dosage, and gamma-ray dosage, such as
were made on the unit-shield mockup,

2. Energy and angular distribution
of gamma rays,

3. Energy and angular distribution
of neutrons, '

Unit-shield measurements will pro-
vide a temporary estimate of measure-
ment 1, and measurement 2, the gamma-
ray spectroscopy, is well under way.
Assuming 140 cm to be a typical shield
thickness, measurements have been made
with the spectrometer(!’ at various
angles with respect to the center line
(see Fig. 20). The results have been
described by Maienschein(?2?) and are
shown in Fig, 21. These data supersede
the preliminary spectradata previously
reported. (3)

ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

Measurements are now being made at
various other distances from the
reactor. The reactor will then be
moved out of the shield into the open
water, and a few of the measurements
will be repeated for comparison with
the spectra i1in the borated-water
shield., Finally, an attempt will be
made to measure the spectrum of gamma
rays emerging from the face of the
reactor,

The third measurement, the energy
and angular distribution of the
neutrons, will be undertaken as soon
as the necessary instruments have been
developed, which now appears likely to
be some time this summer.

REACTOR CALIBRATION

For the divided-shield experiments
the reactor was loaded so as to com-
pletely fill the lattice when rolled
into the shield as shown in Fig. 20.
Furthermore, since the shield con-
tained borated water and duplicate
measurements were to be made with the

~reactor in the open water behind the

shield, the reactor was loaded so as
to minimize the effect of the borated

water and was surrounded on four sides
with beryllium oxide reflector as shown
in Fig, 22. Fuel elements were added
in the interior of the lattice until

" criticality was reached with 3.1 kg of

U235, The complete interior could not
be filled, but two positions (44 and
46) had extra beryllium oxide elements
and two positions (43 and 47) were
left filled with water. Repeating the
critical experiment in the open water
necessitated a slight rearrangement of
the extra beryllium oxide elements,

~which amounted to exchanging the

positions of the extra beryllium oxide
elements (44 and 46 above) with that
of the water (43 and 47). The final
assembly required about 30 g less of
fuel. .

The power distribution of the two
critical assemblies is being measured
with gold foils, following the method
of Meem and Johnson.(*)> All data on
the divided-shield measurements will
be normalized to 1 watt using these
power calibrations, '

~Physics Division

Duct work has been directed toward
obtaining further experimental cor-
roboration of the simplified theory
of neutron transmission through
cylindrical, air-filled ducts in
water. The effects of further vari-
ations in duct diameters, lengths, and
angles of a single bend (with straight
sections of equal length) on neutron
transmission through the duct have
been measured in the Thermal Column
Facility. In addition to the above
variations, measurements have also
been made to predict the effective
source area that contributes to the
radiation reaching the exit of a
single duct. An increase of a factor
of 6 in the calculated source strength
resul ted when the source was increased
from an area equal to that of the
duct mouth to a much larger area.
This was measured for only one duct
size (3 in. ID) and is reported to
indicate the order of magnitude of
the effect. This is, of course, very
important for extrapolating the
single-duct data to a reactor design
in which an array is used. '

The agreement with the theory has
remained good in that the dose can
be predicted for a given duct geometry
within a factor of 2 when the geo-
metrical attenuation of the duct is
as high as 10°%. A report of all
the experimental and theoretical work
on ducts 1s essentially complete and
will be issued during the next quarter.

THEORETICAL TREATMENT OF DUCT
TRANSMISSION

The generalized equation used to
predict a measured dose at the end of

a duct can be written as follows:

 

b Fﬂaz { a? Aa?
- n .
o [ 4] (81,2) 81,% sin 6,

where
D = relative dose {(thermal-neutron
flux),
n, = relative source strength per
unit area,
a = diameter of duct,
!, = length of mth straight section,
A = experimentally determined
constant, including neutron
albedo, etc.,
9m = angle between mth and mth + 1
straight section.
For the.sﬁécial case of equal-
length straight sections with bends

of equal angles,the equation becomes:

B 2

"where m 1s the number of straight

sections. This case gives minimum

transmission for a given center line

length, It should be noted that the
equations are not valid for angles
of bend that areso small that neutrons
can pass directly through the duct

‘without a wall collision. The formula
becomes increasingly more accurate as
the angle of bend approaches 90 degrees.

MEASUREMENT OF AIR-FILLED DUCTS
IN WATER

For correlation with the above
theory, measurements were made with
various configurations of air-filled,
cylindrical ducts 1n the Thermal
Column water tank, including straight
ducts and ducts with single bends up
to 90 degrees. The source areas were
also varied. The measured results
have been compared with the preceding
theory and are within a factor of 2
- for a given duct geometry.

Straight Ducts, One end of the
duct was placed against a fission
source {uranium slugs) in the Thermal
Column water tank, and the counter
was located in the various slots of
‘the counter holder at the other end
of the duct. (These ducts had 1/4-in.
lucite walls and were closed at each
‘end with a 1/4-in. lucite disk.) The
fission-source box included a movable
cadmium shutter to cover the source
‘for background measurements.

Measurements were taken on all
straight-duct configurations with the
full source, which consisted of 24
natural uranium slugs, 1 1/8 by 4 1/8
in., in a rectangular array (9.3 by
12.4 in.). Additional measurements
were made on the 6-in. -ID ducts using
a 6-in.-~diameter circular source by
placing a cadmium shutter with a
6-in.-diameter hole beneath the slugs.
Typical curves for the neutron trans-
mission, as measured along the center
line of the 6-in.-ID ducts, are given
-1n Fig. 23, and traverse measurements
are shown in Fig. 24.

Ducts with Bends., The transmission
of neutrons through a flexible rubber

80

6

hose (60 in. in length, 1/4-in. walls)
with single bends of 0 to 90 degrees
was measured with both the full
rectangular source and a 3-in,-diameter
circular source, The ducts were
sealed with 1 1/2-in. rubber plugs to
give an actual air column of 57 inches.
The two straight sections shortened
as the angle of bend increased, since
the hose was always bent with a 12-in,
radius of curvature, For each angle
the straight sections were of equal
length.

The smallest angle of bend was
equivalent to a displacement of the
center of the duct by one diameter
to prevent neutrons from reaching
the counter without having made at
leastone collisionor having penetrated
the surrounding water. Center line
and traverse measurements for the full
source are shown in Figs. 25 and 26.
Center line measurements were also

made on a 4 1/4-in.-diameter duct

with aluminum walls.

Comparison with Theory. 1In order
to compare the measured results with
the predictions of Eq. 1 or Eq. 2, an
effective source strength must be
determined. To simplify the calcu-
lations and also to give some 1dea
of the change in duct transmission
with energy, the effective source
strengths have been arbitrarily defined
as the relative thermal flux (the
response of a specified counter at
10, 20, and 30 ¢m of water from the
end of the duct) multiplied by the
geometrical attenuation of the duct,
that is, D/n, from Eq. 1 or Eq. 2.
It was assumed that the counter was
large enough to give a reading pro-
portional to the integral of the flux
leaving the duct. This can be shown
to be nearly correct by a comparison
of integrals under the traverses with
the center line readings for various
ducts. If the formula 1s correct,
n, should be a function only of the

0

8. TOWER SHIELDING FACILITY

E. P. Blizard

C. E. Clifford

Physics Division

The preliminary proposal(1) for the
Tower Shielding Facility has been con-
siderably revised, and a firm proposal

"will soon be submitted to the AEC.
‘Calculations of spurious scattering

from the ground and structure indicate
that the shield components (reactor
and crew shields) should be at least
200 ft from the ground and free of
scattering material in the immediate
vicinity of either component. As a
consequence, the original configuration
has been discarded in favor of the
present design, which calculations
indicate will satisfy the requirements.

A new cost estimate for this Tower
Shielding Facility, based on much more
complete analysis, indicates that the
total capital expenditure will be
about two million dollars.

TOWER FACILITY DES TGN

The tower will consist of two
vertical members 300 ft high connected
at the top by a 200-ft bridge., At the
center of the bridge is a 100-ft cross
member from the ends of which will be
suspended a shielded reactor on one
side and a crew shield on the other
(Fig. 29). The distance from the
reactor or crew shield to the ground
will be variable up to about 250 ft;
above 250 ft the scattering from the
cross member would interfere. The
normal operating altitude will be
about 200 feet, The variable height
will make 21t possible to identify and

measure the ground scattering. This
is a very welcome potentiality since
the calculations of this effect may
not be accurate and it can thus be assured
that the divided-shield measurements
do not incorporate an unknown spurious
component. In addition, 1t will be
possible to estimate the added crew
exposure from ground scattering that
will be incurred on take-off and
landing.

It will be possible to mount large
pieces of structural material (e.g.,
aluminum) at various locations around
the reactor or crew shields to simulate
airplane structure. Thus the radiation
scattering from the airplane itself
can be estimated on the basis of
direct experimental evidence,

EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM

The program for the Tower Shielding
Facility as presently conceived will
consist of four parts:

1. Calibration of the facility and
determination of background from
spurious scatterings,

2. Measurement of a shield mockup for
the X-6 airplane (Fig. 30},

3. A general study of divided shields,
including optimizationwith respect
to weight and parametric studies
of reactor-crew separation, weight
distribution, diameter of reactor
shield, size of crew compartment,
etc,,

~

4, A study of the scattering to be
expected from aircraft structure,

engines, and ground.

The total cross section of iron has
been measured on the 5-Mev Van de
Graaff from 0.7 to 3.6 Mev with a

Measurements of the inelastic scatter-

ing levels in iron are now under way

with the accelerator. The time-of-
flight neutron spectrometer has been
installed in the LITR and used (after
optimization of the background-to-
count ratio) to scan the transmission
of indium at a resolution of 1.25 usec
per meter. |

During the last quarter the 5-Mev
Van de Graaff accelerator has been
used to obtain detailed information on
the total cross section of iron and
the inelastic scattering levels
excited in iron by fast neutrons. In
addition, equipment has been assembled
and preliminary measurements have been
made on the total cross sections of
Li® and Li7 and the fission cross

TIME-OF-FLIGHT NEUTRON SPECTROMETER

G. S. Pawlicki, ORINS
E. C. Smith, Physics Division

The time-of-flight neutron spec-
trometer for operation up to several
thousand electron volts has been in-
stalled in the LITR and checked with
indium. When the hard background
level was attenuated by a 3-in.-thick
beryllium filter, the transmission of
indium was satisfactorily scanned at a
resolution of 1.25 psec per meter.

Background Measurements. The
instrument for background measure-
ments, as originally installed in
hole HB-1 of the LITR, looked directly
at fuel elements, and the transmission
of the shutter was not up to design
expectations., A spectrum check made
with the instrument indicated a surplus
of neutrons above a 1/E distribution
at energies greater than 1 kev. A
large fraction of these high-energy
neutrons was subsequently shown to
have an energy above 0.1 Mev. As a
temporary measure an aluminum filter
was first used that did improve the
background-to-count ratio at some
sacrifice in counting rate and defi-
nitely confirmed the suspected reason
for the poor background observed.

By reloading the lattice to provide

3 in., of beryllium in the beam, the

background was reduced to design
expectation without loss of counting
rate. The tabulation in Table 20 shows
the counting rates and backgrounds

SUMMARY AND

The research on high-temperature
liquids has been almost entirely con-
cerned with the development of a fuel-
coolant for the circulating-fuel
reactor, and the effort on liquid
moderators and coolants has been
correspondingly reduced (sec., 10).
The proposed reactor loading technique
requires that the circulating-fuel
solution permit widely varying uranium
concentration with near uniform
melting point. However, for the added
requirement of low (< 10 cp) viscosity,
the previously proposed systemn,
NaF-BeF, -UF,, would provide a suitable
fuel. Of the other available fluorides,
however, several compositions in the
system NaF-KF-ZrF, -UF, appear promising
on the basis of the limited data
available., In addition to this system,
numerous other systems containing
zirconium fluoride are being examined.

The effort on corrosion research
was divided among static and dynamic
tests of fluoride and hydroxide
corrosion and static tests of liquid
metal corrosion (sec., 11). The severe
corrosion experienced in dynamic tests
with fluorides at 1500°F -~ despite
relative inertness 1in static tests -
has redirected attention to fluoride
corrosion phenonema. Although there
is attack of up to 14 mils, the 0.622-
in,~-ID Inconel convection loops will
circulate the fuel, NaF-KF-LiF-UF4,
for the duration of 500- and 1000-hr
tests without plugging. On the other
hand, the 300-series stainless steel
loops have a life expectancy (before
plugging) of 150 hr and the 400-series
stainless steel loops plugin less than
50 hours, It is known that the
uranium-free fluorides are less cor-
rosive than uranium-bearing fluorides
and that in tests with the latter
uranium dioxide crystals form in the
cold zone, The effect of various
additives on both fluoride and hy-
droxide corrosion is now being evaluated

INTRODUCTION

and dynamic corrosion of hydroxides 1is
being determined in various environ-
ments. In one such experiment with
potassium hydroxide in Inconel under
hydrogen, there was no corrosion or
mass transfer after 135 hr at 715°C.

The metallurgical processes involved
in the construction and assembly of a
high-temperature reactor core, includ-
ing fabrication of control rods,
welding and brazing of core structure,
and creep and stress-rupture of metals,
are being investigated (sec. 12)., The
cone-arc welding method may be adapted
for tube-to-header welds in the core,
but the complexity of the heat ex-
changers suggests the use of a brazing
technique. Several boron-free brazing
alloys are being tested to determine
their gqualities as brazing material
and their corrosion resistance. ARE
safety rods will probably be con-
structed of type-430 stainless steel
because of its compatibility with
boron carbide, Stress-rupture and
creep data have been obtained on
fine- and coarse-grained Inconel sheet.

Heat transfer research and physical
properties measurements have been
largely directed to the immediate
needs of circulating-fuel reactor
studies for these data. Measurements
of viscosity, thermal conductivity,
heat capacity and vapor pressure of
one or more of the various fluoride
mixtures are being obtained. The
theoretical analysis of heat transfer
in a circulating-fuel reactor has
established the design parameters for
the core fuel circuit (assuming no
wall heat transfer). Mathematical
natural convections for ligquid fuel
elements have been developed for the
case of turbulent flow. Some data
have been obtained on the heat transfer
of boiling mercury, and data should
soon be available on the heat transfer
of fused salts, hydroxides, and lithium.

ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

Radiation damage studies included

irradiated fuel capsules and inpile
liquid loops and measurements of the
effect of irradiation on creep and
thermal conductivity. In several of the
inpile experiments with fluoride mix-
tures in Inconel capsules, the rate of
attack on the container material has
been considerably higher than that
observed i1n the out-of-pile controls,

98

Radioactive decay curves were taken
while sodium was being circulated in
the inpile loop for 165 hours. Partial
confirmation of the previously observed
decrease in the thermal conductivity
of Inconel at 1500°F under irradiation
has been obtained. The creep of
nickel under irradiation has a higher
rate than 1ts bench counterpart after
about 115 hours.

10. CHEMISTRY OF HIGH-TEMPERATURE LIQUIDS

Warren Grimes, Materials Chemistry Division

The research on high-temperature
ligquids has been concerned almost
entirely with their development for
use as fuels and/or moderators for an
aircraft reactor. The properties
required of these liquids along with
periodic descriptions of progress in
development of such materials have
been the subject of previous re-
ports.(!} During the past guarter,
however, effort on reactor coolants
and on liguid moderator materials has
been markedly reduced, in spite of the
potential long-range importance of the
latter, to increase the effort on

“various aspects of the fluoride

program.

The interest in a circulating-fuel

- ARE has emphasized a need forliquids

of very low melting point at low
uranium concentration., In addition,
it is very desirable to choose the
fuel system so that a dilute (sub-
critical) fuel solution may be intro-
duced to fill the core, and small
increments of a concentrated solution
of uranium in the same solvent may be
added to bring the system to criti-
cality. This requires that solutions
widely varying in uranium content and
melting at temperatures well below the
operating range be available and that
no high-melting compounds be formed at
intermediate concentrations. '

The qualifications seem to be met
adequately by the system NaF-Ber-UF4.

However, 1t appears that the viscosity
of this liquid in the lowest melting
region of the system is too high., Of
the other available materials, several
compositions in the system NaF-KF«ZrF4-
UF, appear promising on the basis of the
limited data available. Numerous other
systems containing zirvconium fluoride
are being examined.

Studies of the 1onic species 1in
molten fluorides by determination of
transference numbers have not proved
capable of unique interpretation.
General planning for production of the
simulated fuel for the "cold" critical
experiment has been completed and

The previous report{?) presented a
preliminary list of five promising
fluoride fuel systems of low uranium
concentration, of which four contained
lithium fluoride as a component,
Since lithium fluoride would be
attractive as a component only if the
heavier isotope of lithium were to
become available inhigh concentration,
only the NaF-BeF,-UF, system appeared
promising for immediate use, However,
the toxicity of beryllium fluoride and
the preliminary indications of high
viscosity of beryllium fluoride-bearing
liquids have prompted efforts to find
other systems for immediate use.
Promising results have been obtained
recently with mixtures containing
zirconium fluoride,

ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

It has been necessary to study the
binary and ternary systems of zir-
conium fluoride with the alkali
fluorides, Work on these uranium-free
materials is reported under "Coolant
Development™ in the following. Ad-
dition of small amounts (1 to 5 mole %)
of uranium fluoride to several of the
systems has been shown to affect the
melting points only slightly, and it
appears likely that any of the low-
melting coolants obtained from the
preliminary studies can be readily
converted to fuels., The available
data on zirconium fuels are reported
under appropriate headings in the
following, along with additional data
on several systems containing beryllium
fluoride.

- NaF-BeF,-UF,. Difficulty in es-

tablishing reproducible melting points
by thermal analysis of mixtures of
high beryllium fluoride concentration
has been discussed,(%?)> 1In an effort
to overcome this difficulty, heating
curves have been compared with cooling
curves for a number of compositions in
this system. Selected mixtures were
heated to 850 to 900°C and cooled,
with stirring, by techniques previ-
ously described. The solidified
materials were then reheated and the
heating curve, measured with chromel-
alumel thermocouples, was recorded in
the manner previously described.

The data shown in Table 21 afford
a comparison between break temperatures

materials and equipment. The highest
temperature at which a break is shown
in the heating curve is considered the
most reliable indication of melting
point available. As the data indicate,
melting points for this system are
Jittle affected by uranium concen-
tration in the range studied. It
appears that mixtures of useful
uranium concentration may be prepared
with melting points below 400°C.

the RbF-BeF,-UF, system seems to show
promise, especially below 5 mole %
uranium tetrafluoride. The physical
properties of this system are probably
very similar to those of analagous

‘sodium fluoride-bearing systems.

LiF-NaF-BeF,-UF,. The above-
mentioned heating technique has been
applied to various mixtures in the
system LiF-NaF-BeF,-UF, in an attempt
to verify the very low melting points
tentatively reported(?’) for these
materials. Although it is possible
that mixtures melting below 325°C may
be prepared from these materials, the
data previously reported seem to be
much too low. Additional studies of
this system will probably be postponed
in favor of more immediate problems.

ments of viscosity have not yet been
made for this material, but microscopic
examination of the solidified melt has
indicated a complete absence of
glasses. It 1s likely that the
viscosity of the liquids will resemble
those of typical fused salt mixtures
rather than glasses. Additional
experiments with this and similar
systems are under way.

SIMULATED FUEL MIXTURE FOR COLD
| CRITICAL EXPERIMENT

D; R. Cuneo L. G. Overholser
Materials Chemistry Division

The cold critical experiment is

‘designed to yield data at room temper-

ature that will be of value in calcu-
lating the critical mass of the final
high-temperature ARE. The primary
requirement of the simulated fuel is
that the density of uranium in the tubes
of fuel mixture be uniform and equal to
the design density of uranium in the
ARE fuel at operating temperatures,

102

In addition, it is desirable to have
the sodium-to-uranium ratio equal to
that in the real ARE fuel and, if
possible, to have the over-all density
of the simulated and real fuels the
same. The hydrogen-to-uranium ratio
must be considerably less than 1; this
will be possible i1f the water content

of the materials is less than 0.01%."

It is presently anticipated that
the ARE fuels will be simulated for
this experiment by packing realistic
fuel tubes with a mixture of uranium
tetrafluoride and sodium fluoride
powders. The Y-12 Production Division
will be responsible for preparing the
enriched fuel and for filling the fuel
tubes. The ANP chemistry group will
render assistance in formulation of
the mixture and experimental study of
tube filling and packing conditions,

Preliminary experiments with uranium
tetrafluoride and sodium fluoride
powders designed to yield information
as to effect of particle size, mixture
composition, water content, and pack-
ing technique on uranium density,
over-all density, and ease of segre-
gation of the mixture are under way.

IONIC SPECIES IN FUSED FLUORIDES

Determination of the electrolytic
transference numbers in fused fluoride
mixtures containing uranium tetra-
fluoride was attempted in an effort to
ascertain the nature of the ionic
species in these systems. The equip-
ment and general technique used in the

have been discussed in a previous
report. (%) Uncertainties owing to the
use of an electrically conducting

diaphragm in the cell and, in part,
to the lack of high accuracy in the
analytical methods available limit the
usefulness of the data obtained.
Consequently, no further studies of
electrolytic transference are now
anticipated, Before these experi-
ments can be improved, an electrical
insulator capable of holding the
salts without reaction and con-
siderably better analytical methods
than now exist will be needed. (An
excellent review of such experiments
has been given by Baimakov and
Samusenko.(%)) The following experi-
mental results from the recent study
are, however, of interest,

The number of electrons necessary
to reduce one uranium(IV) ion to metal
decreases from about four in the more
dilute solutions to less than two 1in
the more concentrated ones. The
changes in the ion fraction of uranium
in the two compartments of the cell
are not altogether consistent. The
anolyte concentration of uranium does
not differ significantly from that
found before electrolysis, whereas the
change in the catholyte concentration
is little more than the experimental
error. On the other hand, the alkali
metal concentration rises sharply in
the catholyte and slightly in the
anolyte. | :

The apparent deviations from
Faraday’s law may represent a case of
stenolysis, i.e., electrode processes

-occurring in the pores of the diaphragm

separating the anolyte and catholyte.
If all current passing through the
cell did so by a stenolytic mechanism,
two electrons would apparently suffice
to reduce one uranium(IV) ion to
metal, whereas complete absence of
stenolysis would require four electrons
per reduced uranium(IV). Tt is
possible that the diaphragm used was

not completely permeable touranium(IV)
and that the deviations from Faraday’s
law result froman increase of stenoly-
sis with increasing uranium tetra-
fluoride concentration. A photo-
micrograph of the surface of the
diaphragm, however, seemed to indicate
a pore size sufficient to pass any of
the 1ons probably present,

The stenolytic behavior, coupled
with the observed concentration
changes, indicates that the quadrai-
valent uranium is probably not present
as Ut4., The small radius of this ion
and its large charge indicate a high
mobility. That this is not observed
is evidence for the presence of some
more complicated species.

PREPARATION OF PURE HYDROXIDES

D. R. Cuneo D. E. Nicholson
E. E. Ketchen L. G. Overholser
Materials Chemistry Division

Development of moderator-coolants
has been limited during the past
quarter to preparation of pure alkal:
and alkaline earth hydroxides for
corrosion studies. Barium, strontium,
and sodium hydroxide have been prepared
with acceptable purity, that is, con-
taining less than 0.1, 0.06, and 0.1%,
respectively, of their carbonates,
Purification of the potassium hydroxide
has not been so successful.

Barium hydroxide has been prepared,
in a quantity sufficient for use in
dynamic corrosion experiments, by a
procedure(%) that yields 1-1b batches
of material containing less than 0.1
wt % barium carbonate. Strontium

~ hydroxide prepared by the same process

contained 0.06%of strontium carbonate,
and spectrographic analysis showed
about 0.1% barium hydroxide. Strontium
hydroxide may be dehydrated without
difficulty but is not yet available in
large quantity.

Additional batches of sodium hy-
droxide have been purified by removing
sodium carbonate from a 50% aqueous
solution of sodium hydroxide and
dehydrating under vacuum at 425°C.

- These batches have assayed 100.0%

-sodium.hydroxide, and the sodium
carbonate content has been less than

0.1% in'all_qases.

Potassium carbonate can be removed
from potassium hydroxide by dissolution
of the latter compound in isopropyl
alcohol, but it has not proved possible
to remove the alcohol from potassium
hydroxide without carbonization and
contamination of the potassium hy-

~droxide. Potassium hydroxide prepared

by dehydration of an aqueous solution
containing 5 wt % potassium hydroxide,
which had been treated with barium
hydroxide, still contained about 0.3%
potassium carbonate, The potassium
carbonate content of higher concen-
tration potassium hydroxide solutiomns
decreased, however. There was 0.1%
potassium carbonate in the 38 wt %
aqueous solution of potassium hy-
droxide. Recent experimental determi-
nations have shown that barium carbonate
is appreciably soluble in potassium
hydroxide. Preliminary studies of the
feasibility of using calcium hydroxide
for this carbonate removal are 1in

under construction for preparing
potassium hydroxide by reaction of
pure water with metallic potassium.

COOLANT DEVELOPMENT

J. P. Blakely R. C, Traber, Jr.
L. M. Bratcher C. J. Barton

Materials Chemistry Division

Investigation of low-melting
fluoride mixtures for possible appli-
cation as coolants has been continued
during the past quarter. Imn addition
to possible value as coolants, any
low-melting compositions discovered
are of potential value as solvents for
uranium tetrafluoride in the prepara-
tion of fuels of low uranium content,

Recent interest in fuel systems
containing zirconium fluoride has led
to a considerable program of study in
phase equilibria in alkali fluoride-
zirconium fluoride systems. Although
several of these systems show promise,
in no case are the data sufficient for
construction of the phase diagram, In
many of these mixtures well-defined
thermal breaks occur well below the
ligquidus temperature, It has not been
definitely established whether these
effects are the result of solad
transitions or the presence of some

 

 

 
 

 

3

impurity such as ZrOF,, which is known

" to be present in the only available

zirconium fluoride.

LiF-ZrF,. The system'LiF-ZrF4,
which is of possible future interest,
is under study in order to obtain a
complete picture of the alkali fluoride-
zirconium fluoride systems. Cooling
curves have been run on nine mixtures
ranging between 15 and 70 mole % zir-
conium fluoride. There appears to be
a eutectic at about 39 mole % zir-
conium fluoride melting at 560 * 10°C.
No congruently melting compounds were
observed, but there 1s some evidence
for an incongruently melting compound
that is probably Li,ZrF . Breaks other
than melting points or the eutectic
halt were observed at 590, 515, and
470°C in some mixtures, This study
will be continued in greater detail
at some future date. ‘

NaF-ZrF,. The study of the system
NaF-ZrF, is still in progress; mixtures
between 10 and 50 mole % zirconium
fluoride have been studied. It appears
likely that there is a eutectic at
approximately 35 mole % zirconium
fluoride, melting at 595+ 10°C, Breaks
other than melting points or eutectic
halts were observed at approximately
735, 530, and 495°C with some mixtures.

 KF-ZrF,., Although cooling curves
have been run on a rather large number
of mixtures in the system KF-ZrF,,
covering the range from 5 to 95 mole %
zirconium fluoride, the melting point
of some compositions has not been
determined with certainty. The
existence of a eutectic at 13 mole %

~zirconium fluoride, melting at 765 *

10°C, was established and a compound
K,ZrF,, melting congruently at 910 *
10°C, has been demonstrated. Mixtures
in the range 30 to 60 mole % zir-
conium fluoride show well-defined

breaks or halts at 415 to 435 and 485°C

for some compositions.

FOR PERIOD ENDING MARCH 10, 1952

RbF-ZrF,, The system RbF-ZrF, has
been studied in the range 5 to 60
mole % zirconium fluoride and appears
to be quite similar to the KF-ZrF,
system., There 1s a eutectic at about
6 mole % zirconium fluoride, melting
at 720 + 10°C, and the compound Rb,ZrF,
melts congruently at 870 %+ 10°C, It
appears likely that there is a eutectic
between 30 and 40 mole % zirconium
fluoride, melting at 575 + 10°C, but
there are also well-marked breaks on
the cooling curves for mixtures in this
range at about 405°C.

NaF-KF-Zr¥,. Cooling curves have
been run on more than 50 mixtures in
the ternary system NaF-KF-ZrF,, and it
should be possible to draw contours
for this system when the corresponding
binary phase diagrams are completed.
The lowest melting composition that
has been found in this system contained
43 mole % zirconium fluoride, 5 mole %

 sodium fluoride, and 52 mole % potassium

fluoride. This mixture exhibited no
break in the cooling curve above 405°C
and stirred down to this temperature.
When heated, i1t started stirring at
405°C and showed no further break up
to 500°C, at which temperature the
experiments were terminated, Other
similar systems showed considerably
higher melting points., The 405°C
melting point therefore seems to
require. further verification. Com-
positions with about the same amount
of zirconium fluoride as the above-
mentioned mixture but with more sodium
fluoride and less potassium fluoride
show well-marked breaks in the cooling
curves at approximately 450°C, which

may indicate a eutectic melting at

this temperature; the composition of

‘this eutectic has not been established.

NaF-RbF-ZrF,. The NaF-RbF-ZrF,
system has been investigated about as
thoroughly as the NaF-KF-ZrF, system.
The lowest melting point recorded was
460°C for the mixture containing 52

ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

mole % zirconium fluoride, 11 mole %
‘rubidium fluoride, and 37 mole %
sodium fluoride. Other breaks were
observed in the cooling curve for this
and other compositions at temperatures
ranging from 410 to 440°C. These
could be caused by a solid transition
or by a eutectic of unknown compo-
s1t1on. :

7 NaF-KF-LiF- ZrF . Onlyzafew mixtures
dwere prepared 1n the four component
system NaF KF LiF- ZrF, Increasing
amounts of zirconium fluoride were
added to the ternary NaF-KF-LiF
eutectic (42 mole % KF, 46.5 mole %
LiF, 11.5 mole % NaF), Wthh was con-
sidered to be one component of a
pseudoblnary mixture. The cooling
curves that were run after each ad-
dition of zirconium fluoride showed
that the melting p01nt climbs rather
rapldly, reaches a maximum of 810°C at
20 mole % zirconium fluoride, drops
sharply to 450°C at 30 mole % zir-
¢onium fluoride, and then rises again.

. PREPARATION OF PURE FLUORIDES

CG. J. Nessle ~ F. F. Blankenship
“J. E. Eorgan  W. R. Grimes

: ,Matérials Chemistry Division

- The lack of successful operation of
the thermal loops with fluoride fuel
material as presently supplied and the
definite plans for an ARE in the
relatively near future have emphasized
the need for research on equipment for
preparation of pure, homogeneous,

fluoride solutions and handling of the
llqulds so as to keep them free from
contamination until they are used.

The mass-transfer phenomenon, which
tfansfers metal from hot to cold
regions of the thermal loops, is still
not well understood. However, all the
plugs so far observed have contained
considerable quantities of oxide
sludge admixed with the metal particles.
It has not been established that the
oxides are primarily responsible for

106

corrosion, but freedom of the system
from oxides would certainly help to
clarify the picture. In additiomn, it
is essential for reactor operation that
the fuel be free from sludge formation.

The raw materlals for fuel manu -
facture are, in general, quite hygro-
scopic; 1t 1is difficult to prevent
some pickup of water during the un-
avoidable handling of the powders.
Furthermore, any water picked up by
the fluorides will hydrolyze uranium
tetrafluoride to insoluble uranium
dioxide when the temperature is raised.
Uranium tetrafluoride also oxidizes
readily at elevated temperatures to
yield volatile uranium hexafluoride
and soluble and corrosive U0,F, if any
oxXygen 1s present. It seems evident
therefore that improvement of the
corrosion picture would result if
satisfactory means existed for pre-
paring and handling fluorides so that
oxidation or hydrolization could not
occur. (onsequently, equipment de-
31gned to prevent these reactions
during fuel preparation and transfer
are being developed

Fuel Preparatlon Eoulpment The
fuel preparat1on equipment w111 be a
reactor in which all lines in contact
with the molten fluor1des are of
nickel so that they can readlly be
reduced with hydrogen to remove oxide
films and scale. The reactor will be
charged with dry, pure fluorides,
sealed by the gasketed flanges to the
gas manifold, and evacuated to remove
as much adsorbed oxygen and water as
possible at low temperatures. The
mixture will then be melted and
treated at 500 to 600°C with dry "
oxygen-free hydrogen to reduce any
UO,F, or UF, formed by oxidation or
present in the uranium tetrafluoride
used. The water will react with the
uranium tetrafluoride at this tempera-
ture and yield hydrogen fluoride, which
will be swept and pumped out, and

 

  

 

 

 

 

 
 

o

 

 

uranium dioxide, which will be sus-
pended in the melt, By treatment of
the molten liquid at 500 to 600°C with
dry hydrogen fluoride, the suspended
oxides can be reconverted to fluorides.
The excess hydrogen fluoride will be
pumped off, the liquid swept with pure
helium, and the pure liguid transferred
through a nickel filter to a clean

"receiver by use of helium pressure.

The pure material will be used for
capsule and dynamic loop corrosion
studies, as well as for all physical
property measurements, It is antici-
pated that a number of preparations
will be made under varying conditions
of temperature, exposure time, liquid
composition, etc, to define the optimum

conditions for operation before the
material is used for systematic
testing,

Fuel Handling Equipment. TIf the
fuel preparation is to be conducted
under such stringent conditions, 1t
will obviously be undesirable to have
it contaminated before testing. Conse-
quently, a capsule-fillingrig is being
developed in which corrosion capsules
can be treated with hydrogen, hydrogen
fluoride, fluorine, or any desired
reagent, filled with an inert gas,
connected to a source of pure fuel,
filled, sealed, and welded without
exposure to alr or to an uncontrolled
atmosphere.

W. R. Grimes, Materials Chemistry Division

W. D. Manly, Metallurgy Division
H. W. Savage, ANP Division

The major emphasis in the corrosion
testing program returned, during the
past quarter, to the procblem of con-
tainer materials for the fused fluoride
mixtures. This effort was extended
considerably followingthe difficulties
encountered during circulation of the
fluorides by forced convection 1in
closed metal systems. Empirical
testing of corrosion of fluoride
mixtures by the static capsule tech-
nique previously described has been
continued, and dynamic testing of
fluoride corrosion 1s being intensively
investigated by several technigques,
for example, thermal convection loops,
seesaw tests, and standpipes. In
addition, a large program of a more
fundamental nature dealing with
possible reactions of metals with the
fluoride melts has been initiated.

Static corrosion testing under
generally isothermal conditions has
been continued with several high-
temperature liquids and structural
metals by using slight variations of
the capsule technique previously
described. Other materials have been
tested in the molten fluorides to
find possible bearing materials and
valve seat materials that would not
be seriously attacked by the fluoride
mixture, Stellite, which 1s a good
valve seat material, is apparently
unattacked in the fluoride mixture

"~ when tested statically.' Additions of

zirconium and magnesium as possible

.corrosion inhibitors were made to the

fluorides prior to running corrosion
tests. It was found that magnesium
increased the corrosion attack,
whereas additions of zirconium de-
creased the attack of the fluorides
on 300-series stainless steels.

Static corrosion tests have also
been run on low melting point alloys
for secondary coolants, such as
sodium-lead alloys and the hydroxides.
Low melting point alloys containing
mixtures of lead, tin, cadmium, and
bismuth have been tested to find
suitable container material. It has
been found that lead-cadmium and
bismuth-cadmium alloys can be stati-
cally contained in type-317 stainless
steel. Corrosion testing in sodium-
lead alloyshas shown that the addition
0of sodium to lead lessens the attack
on stainless steels and Inconel.
Additions of zirconium, sodium, sodium
carbonate, sodium cyanide, and sodium
hydride were made to sodium hydroxide
prior to running statlc corrosion
tests, and the effects of these
additions have been tabulated.

Al though the static capsule tech-
nigque has proved satisfactory for
routine screening of materials, 1t
lacks sufficient sensitivity to
anticipate the results of the more
difficult, large-scale, dynamic tests.
When routine dynamic tests that can
be conducted in large numbers are
developed, the static capsule method
will be discarded. Thermal convection
loops, which have hitherto been used
almost exclusively for dynamic cor-
rosion tests, have now been supple-
mented by a seesaw capsule technique
and standpipe tests.

Dynamic corrosion of the fluorides
and hydroxides has been studied with
these devices. Dynamic corrosion
testing reveals the corrosion behavior
of different alloyswith the fluorides,
the effect of inhibitor additions, and
provides a means for determining the

effect on the reaction of various

atmospheres, such as argon, hydrogen,
oxygen, and vacuum, in contact with

the bath., One dynamic experiment has

shown that potassium hydroxide can be
successfully contained in Inconel
without corrosion or mass transfer,
For this experiment, the loop was
operated under a hydrogen atmosphere
for 135 hr with a hot-leg temperature
of 715°C and a cold-leg temperature of

- 440°C., This effort on container

materials for molten hydroxides 1is
supplemental to a fundamental approach
to the corrosion problem through
reactionsof hydroxides with structural
metals at high temperatures.

STATIC CORROSIONBY FLUORIDES

F. Kertesz
Materials Chemistry Division

D. C. Vreeland

During the past quarter testing
techniques have been improved and
corrosion ‘tests of a wide variety
of materials in various fluorides
have been completed. Even so, weight
change and penetration data from the
recent tests with dilute fuels do not
justify a conclusion as to which
metal among Inconel and stainless
steels types-316, -321, -347 and -316
ELC is superior. The latest static
tests of Inconel and 300-series
stainless steels in carefully prepared

~fluoride mixtures support the earlier

conclusion that there is little
corrosive reaction at 1500°F.

A series of screening tests in the
untreated fluoride fuel (NaF-KF-LiF-UE,)
for 100 hr at 1500°F showed that the
refractory metals and Stellite were
unaffected and that the stainless
steels were attacked to a depth no
greater than 1 mil. Analyses of the
fluorides after corrosion tests have

110

. ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

indicated that no major reaction
capable of changing the physical
properties of the fluoride melt had

occurred. The effects of several
additives to the fluoride have been
determined. Zirconium and uranium

dioxide apparently decrease the cor-
rosiveness of the fluoride, whereas
magnesium and uranium oxide increase
the corrosion. -

Effect of Pretreatment of Fuel
(H. J. Buttram, N. V. Smith, R. E.
Meadows, C. R. Croft, Materials
Chemistry Division). The original

tests with fuels of high uranium

content (120 to 140 1b of uranium per
ft®) showed extensive corrosion (4 to
8 mils) if the materials, as received,
were melted under inert atmospheres
and used in the tests. After treatment
with stainless steel and Inconel,
however, these fuels showed con-
siderably reduced corrosion (0.5 to
2 mils) in 100 hr at 800°C. The
more dilute fuels (5 to 10 1b of
uranium per ft®) containing lithium
fluoride and beryllium fluoride,
which are under study at present, are
not appreciably improved by the
treatment procedure; they show 1 to
3 mils of penetration whether treated
or not treated.

Corrosion of Structural Metals

(D. C. Vreeland, E. E. Hoffman, R. B.
Day, L. D. Dyer, Metallurgy Division).
In addition to a series of screening
tests of various materials in an
untreated fluoride fuel for 100 hr
at 1500°F, some data have been ob-
tained on the corrosion of the treated
fuel on molybdenum, cold-worked
Inconel, and stainless steel. There
is no discernable temperature effect
between 850 and 1000°C on the cor-
rosion of Inconel and several stainless
steels,

The screening tests of various
materials in fluoride fuel (43.5 mole

and 1.1 mole % UF4)-have been com-
pleted. These tests were run with
dehydrated, untreated, fluoride
mixtures for 100 hr at 816°C under
vacuum. Molybdenum, columbium, Monel,
and Stellite 25 were apparently un-
attacked. All the 300-series stain-
less steels tested (types-310, -317,
-321, -347, and -304 ELC) were attacked
to a depth of 1 mil or less, except
type-304 ELC, which was attacked to a

depth of 2 mils. Stainless steels of

Molybdenum was not attacked, and the

(1 mil or less).

Static tests have also been run on

specimens of as-received and ap-
proximately 20% cold-worked Inconel
and 20% cold-worked types-316 and -310
stainless steel in the above-mentioned
fluoride fuel at 816°C for 100 hours.
This amount of cold working appeared
to have no significant effect on the
corrosion properties of these materials
under the testing conditions employed.
Tests have also been run at 850, 900,
and 1000°C for 100 hours. The extent
of attack varied from 2 to 5 mils,

‘but no definite correlation between

temperature of test and amount of

attack could be established. Ap-
parently these materials are in-
sensitive to test temperatures within
this range. '

Corrosion by Fluorides with Various
Additives. A short series of tests
on Inconel and type-309 stainless
steel have been run using fluoride
fuel (NaF-KF-LiF-UF,) with zirconium
and magnesium added to the tests in
the form of turnings. The results are
summarized in Table 27,

The additions of magnesium ap-
parently increased the corrosion of
both type-309 stainless steel and

Inconel. Additions of zirconium
appeared to lessen the attack of the
fluoride on these metals. In the

tests with the zirconium additions 1t
was noted that built-up surface layers
of 1 1/2 to 2 mils and 1/2 mil in

thickness were present on the Inconel

Inconel corrosion specimen is shown
in Fig, 32. An attempt is being made
to identify these layers by spectro-
graphic methods.

Preliminary experiments have in-
dicated that addition of uranium
dioxide to the fuels does not increase
the corrosion i1n static experiments.
Additionof uranium oxide has, however,
greatly increased the corrosion ob-
served even in the static tests., It
is likely that this is true of any
hexavalent uranium compound including
UO,F,, which is the expected product
of oxidation of uranium tetrafluoride.
This is discussed in a separate

1500°F. A 26% molybdenum-74% nickel
alloy showed light attack to a depth
of 2 mils, whereas a 25% nickel-75%
iron alloy was attacked to a depth
of only 1 mil. Other alloys composed
of equal parts of iron and nickel;
iron, nickel, and cobalt; and nickel
and cobalt have also been tested.
Al though one of these alloys was
severely corroded, in general, the
attack was quite erratic with deep
local penetrations. Since the capsules
and specimens were machined from as-
cast bars without prior working or
annealing, it is believed that the
cast structure of these materials may
have caused this type of attack. It

is planned to test materials of

a more uniform structure.

Corrosion by Sodium Hydroxide with
Various Additives. A series of tests
were run with sodium hydroxide and
various addition agents, 1including
zirconium, sodium, sodium carbonate,

The addition of approximately 50% of
sodium cyanide appeared to lessen
attack somewhat on type-316 stainless

tested appeared to reduce corrosion to
an insignificant level., Details of
these tests are presented in Table 29.

STATIC CORROSIONBY LIQUID METALS

Liquid metal corrosion studies
during the past quarter have been
limited to the testing of various
low melting point alloys of potential
use as a secondary coolant and a
number of lead-sodium alloys. Inconel

~and types-310 and -317 stainless steel

were tested in the low melting. alloys
for 100 hr at 1500° F. The type-317

stainless steel was Gnattacked by the

82% lead-18% columbium alloy and only
slightly attacked by the 60% bismuth-40%
cadmium alloy, whereas Inconel and the
type-310 stainless steel were generally
subject to somewhat greater attack.
containing as
little as 5% sodium have been suc-
cessfully contained in Inconel and a
number of 300- and 400-series stain-
less steels with no greater than

1/2-mil attack after 100 hr at 1500°F.

Corrosion by Low Melting Point
Alloys. A low melting point alloy is
being considered as a coolant in a
secondary heat exchanger, so several
eutectic compositions of low melting
point alloys have been employed as
corroding mediums in static corrosion
tests with types-310 and -317 stainless
steel and Inconel. The compositions

116

and melting points of the eutectic

alloys used are listed in Table 30.

all the low melting point alloys

be extremely vigorous in their attack
on the metals tested. It is believed
that the type of attack in these
mediums can be classified either as
intergranular, as in Fig. 33 that
shows the characteristic penetration
along the grain boundaries sometimes
accompanied by voids, or as an alloying
type of attack in which the attacked
surface actually alloys with the
molten coolant being tested, as shown
in Fig. 34.

Inconel did not show much promise
in the tests. Type-317 stainless
steel was unattacked by the 82%
lead-18% cadmium alloy and only
slightly attacked by the60% bismuth-40%
cadmium alloy. The results of these
tests are summarized in Table 31,
It is planned to test other structural
materials in the low melting point
alloys that proved least corrosive in

the initial tests.

Dynamic corrosion testing 1n the
thermal convection loops in which the
bulk of the testing has been per-
formed has now been supplemented by a
number of techniques that promise to
duplicate the phenomena shown in the
large loops with much smaller and
more economical equipment. One of
these technigues is the standpipe
test 1n which controlled thermal
gradients may be introduced. The
most promising, however, 1s the seesaw
technique with which fluid motion as

characteristics are such as to ac-
centuate the effects leading to mass
transfer. The loops can be adapted
to allow the exclusion of oxygen,
water vapor - and to some extent
metallic oxides — from the system.
The loops are formed of 1/2-in.-ID
tubing with a nominal wall thickness
of 0.035 in. into the form of a
rectangle, 7 by 17 in., with a loading
tube extending above the hot leg of
the loop. A dehydration pot is
connected with the loop by standard
1/4-in. tubing. Glass tubing is
attached at the tops of the loading legs
of both the loop and the dehydration
pot by means of Kovar seals for
connect1ng ‘vacuum and hydrogen lines.
The furnaces for heating the loops

_are constructed from heating coils
“‘mounted in split, cylindrical ceramic
forms fitted around the sections of
;the_loop._

Seesaw Corrosion Tests. The seesaw

tests require a sealed metal tube
approximately one-third full of molten
“material.
“'a furnace capableof heating to 1700°F

;and up to 18 sealed corr081on capsules

The capsules are placed in

To create
a temperature differentr1al, the
capsules may be placed so that one end
emerges from the furnace. The tubes
are gently rocked on a central fulcrum
similar to a seesaw so that the molten
medium flows by grav1ty to both ends
of each tube The apparatus is shown
in Fig. 35. After several thousand
cYcles,'the tubes are sectioned for
examination. It is anticipated that
in this manner the mass transfer and
enhanced corrosion phenomena can be
obtained and a variety of condltlons

type of test frequently referred to
as the standpipe test involves capsules
similar to those used in the seesaw
tests, except that they are almost
completely filled with the fluid and

120

with desired pretreatment,

are held stationary in a vertical
position. This is not a true dynamic
test because the fluid is essentially
immobile. With this type of test,
however, the temperature gradient may
be controlled so that it is hottest
at the top, bottom, or center. Normal
convection provides the only means of
circulation. After a suitable time,

the tubes are sectioned and examined.

Another design with which a large
thermal gradient may be obtained
employs a U-shaped tube. In this
apparatus there is a large temperature
differential between the two legs,
but there is the smallest possible AT
from top to bottom of each leg (to
minimize local convection currents).
The object of such tests with this
apparatus is to determine the contri-
bution of temperature difference alone
to corrosion and/or metal transport.

A third type of apparatus will
permit one portion of a metal specimen
to be water-cooled internally. One
end of the metal will be immersed in a
crucible containing stirred or un-
stirred molten test fuel at aspecified
temperature. This equipment will be
contained in a 5-1 pot furnace.

Rotating Dynamic Corrosion Tests.
Another tester incorporates means for
preparing the li1iquid to be used
and for inserting a rotating specimen
that acts as a small pump for agitating
the liquid. Basic components of the
apparatus are a lined pot for the
preparation of the eutectic and a
lined receiver with a screen between
the pot and receiver. The sequence of
operations includes preparing the
eutectic from components in the pot,
| and then
up-ending the device to allow the

molten fluoride to run into the

receiver. The pots are then separated
in a dry box and the receiver fastened
onto the stuffing-box assembly that
includes a weighed andmeasured rotating

Forced Convection Loeps. Forced
circulation loops are not routinely
used for corrosion research. Several
pump loops, heat exchanger loops, etc.
are operating with both sodium and the
fluorides, but these are primarily for
the development of the mechanical
equipment (sec. 3). The flow rates
attainable in thermal convection loops
have been adequate to expose corrosion
When corrosion tests with
higher flow rates are necessary, they
will be performed in forced convection
loops.

‘-DYNAMIC'CORROSION BY FLUORIDES

A program for‘dynamic testing of

various fluoride mixturesin containing

materials is being conducted in the
large (1/2 in. ID) thermal convection

loops. Duringthis period the emphasis
‘has been on screening tests to deter-

mine the more feasible container
At present none of the
stainless steels or Inconel will
satisfactorily contain the fluoride

mixtures under dynamic conditions at

1500°F, In general, the uranium

‘bearlng fluoride (NaF-KF-LiF- UF,)

ls more corrosive ‘than the eutectlc
mixture NaF KF-LiF. Furthermore, with
the above fluoride fuel mixture, no

_ 400-series stalnless steel loop has
~operated more than 15 hr before

plugging, whereas no 300-series stain-

‘less steel loop has operated for more
~than 150 hr before plugging.
‘loops, on the other. hand, generally
‘run to scheduled termination at 500 hr

‘Inconel

without plugging, but the loop material
is usually attackedto 10 mils or more.
Preliminary results of fluoride

corrosion in seesaw tests have sub-
stantiated previous results, which

122

indicated that uranium-free fluorides
were less corrosive than similar
systems containing uranium tetra-
fluoride. In these seesaw tests, as

~well as similar standpipe tests, the

formation of uranium dioxide crystals
in the cold zone was observed.

Corrosion by Fluorides in Thermal
Convection Loops (G. M. Adamson,
K. W. Reber, Metallurgy Division).
It is of particular interest that no
system or mechanical device other
than convection loops has ceased
operatlon because of plugging, parent
metal pipe failure, or liquid leakage
(except at poorly designed welds).
It is equally true, however, that some
of the other systems would not have
endured had the walls and parts been
thin enough to permit full penetration
of 1ntergranular corrosion., All
loops, with one exception, have been
of the same design and have been
fabricated from 1/2-in,-ips, sched-
ule-40 pipe.

Table 32 is a summary of the cor-
rosion data from all loops, including
those still in operation, in which
tests have been made with fluorides.
It is evident that considerable cor-
rosion occurred in all loops examined
so far and that the presence of uranium
in the coolant accelerates plugging.
The two stainless steel loops that
contain fluoride mixtures without
uranium show no signs of plugging
after 350 hr of operation, whereas
all stainless steel loops containing
the uranium-bearing fluorides have
plugged.

The 300-series stainless steels
with uranium-bearing fluorides usually
plugin from 100 to 200 hr in convective
systems, and the life appears to be

"on the order of 10 hr/mil (0.001 in.)

of thickness. The 400-series stainless
steels usually plug in 50 hr or less.
Inconel loops, on the other hand, have
not plugged in any of the 500- and

Chemical analyses of hot- and
cold-leg materials after operation
indicate an increase in concentration
of heavier components in the cold leg
and of lighter components in the hot
leg. The tube walls of the hot and
coldlegs from an Inconel loop (No. 210)
that ran for 500 hr with the fluoride
fuel (NaF-KF-LiF- UF,) are shown in
Fig. 36. The attack shown 1in the
hot leg is more than can be tolerated
if a thin-walled tube is to be used.
Very little, if any, attack is found
in the cold-leg section. The hot and
cold legs of a type-316 stainless

" steel loop (No. 113) that plugged

after 123 hr of circulating the
fluoride fuel are shown in Fig. 37.
The mechanism and nature of the
plugging in the stainless steel loops
have notyet been determined. Metallic
dendrites can be found in these loops,

“but as yet it is not certain that
Kthey are present in sufficient quanti-
~ties to cause the plugging.

Corrosion by Fluorides in a Seesaw
Furnace (A. D. Brasunas and L. S.

Two seesaw tests were made with the

1.1 mole % UF,) contained in Inconel
tubes in which the tubes were "rocked”
for 162,000 cycles (450 hr). The
hot-zone temperature was approximately
800°C and temperature drops of 120 and
180°C were maintained. Manytiny,
metal dendrites were observed em-

‘bedded in the fluoride at the hot and

cold ends of the tubes. They were

 presumably attached to the wall prior
‘to the solidification of the fluoride

centered-cubic metgl with a lattice
parameter of 3.541 A. An analysis of

DYNAMIC CORROSIONBY HYDROXIDES

The dynamic corrosion of sodium
hydroxide in nickel convection loops
and of potassium hydroxide in Inconel
loops has been investigated., Both
these systems have been operated in a
carefully maintained hydrogen atmos-
phere, and comparable runs have been
"obtained with the sodium hydrox-
ide-nickel system in air and in
vacuum. All these loops were carefully
cleaned and hydrogen-fired. The
hydrogen itself was first dehydrated
and then loaded and maintained under
the desired pressure.

Appreciable mass transfer occurred
in the three sodium hydroxide-nickel
thermal convection loops that have
been operated. The presence of oxygen
definitely increased the oxidative
corrosion in the loop; this type of
corrosion can possibly be completely
eliminated if the loop 1s operated
under an atmosphere of hydrogen.

One Inconel-potassium hydroxide
loop operated for 135 hr showed neither
mass transfer nor appreciable cor-
rosion. The maximum hot-leg tempera-
ture was only 715°C.

Preliminary tests in the seesaw
furnace and standpipe have been
conducted with sodium hydroxide.
Standpipe tests under hydrogen atmos-
phere have shown neither mass transfer
nor oxidation with hot-zone tempera-
tures of 740°C., Both seesaw and
standpipe tests under vacuum have
shown the now-familiar crystal for-
mation (predominately nickel oxide)
and mass transfer.

Corrosidh“By'HydrOXides in Thermal

Convection Loeps (G. P. Smith, J. V.

Division). Five Inconel loops con-
taining potassium hydroxide and four
nickel loops containing sodium hy-
droxide have been operated. These

ST R (T g e

G i M

" FOR PERIOD ENDING MARCH 10, 1952

loops areof the second type previously
described under "Thermal Convection
Loops.”™ The care taken in these
experiments is exemplified by the
following procedure:

1. The loop and hydroxide (in the
attached loading pot) were
hydrogen-fired at temperatures

up to 150°C,

2. The hydroxide was dehydrated by
maintaining the system under

vacuum for 48 hr at 500°C.

3. The system was refired with
hydrogen.

4. The hydroxide was loaded into
the loop under hydrogen pressure,

5. The hydroxide in the loop was
maintained under hydrogen, air,
or vacuum, as the case may have
been.

Operation of one of the sodium
hydroxide-nickel systems ended prema-
turely. The remaining three loops
were operated in air, vacuum, or
hydrogen, and in each loop a con-
siderable amount of mass transfer
occurred between the hot and cold
legs. In the loop operated under
vacuum for 317 hr, there were moder-
ately heavy deposits of nickel in the
cold leg both in the form of dendritic
needles and as a dense, compact layer
on the loop walls.

The loop run under an oxygen atmos-
phere for 117 hr (Fig. 38) showed no
polished regions even in the hot leg.
However, the wall surfaces of the

_entire inside of the loop were covered

with a heavy, black powder that was
found to contain nickelous oxide,
metallic nickel, and an unidentified
constituent. Crystals of nickel
could be distinguished in the cold
leg, and there was an extremely heavy
deposit of nickel crystals in the

was no evidence of intergranular

- attack.

The sodium hydroxide-nickel system,
which operated under hydrogen for
296 hr (Fig. 39), showed considerable
mass transfer between the hot and
cold leg. The hot region showed a
high surface polish that extended over
the entire high-temperature region.
It was significant that no oxidation
occurred inside the loop, as evidenced
by a complete absence of black powder.
Metallographic examination of this
loop has not been completed, and
hence no information is available
concerning the extent of removal of
metal from the hot-leg walls,

Operation of four of the five
Inconel loops with potassium hydroxide
ended prematurely, but the fifth loop
was operated for 135 hr with hot- and
cold-leg temperatures of 715 and

440°C, respectively (Fig. 40). The

run had tobe stopped at 135 hr because
a failureof the temperature controller
allowed the cold leg to freeze. No
mass transfer occurred in this loop.
Virtually no change could be noted in
the wall thickness of either the hot
or the cold legs. A slight smoothing
out of the irregularities in the loop

wall was noted in both the hot’ and -
cold legs, but otherwise there was,

little ev1dence of corr031on

An abundance of crystals was formed'
in the cold zones of the tube afterm'
117 hr, and the usual surface polishing

was noted in the hot zones (Fig. 41).
Similar tests with nickel and sodium

the usual metal crystals, appreciable

Both the black, comb-like crystals
and the hexagonal, green platelets

~were positively identified as nickel

Standpipe Tests of Sodium Hydroxide
Corrosien (A. D. Brasunas and L. S.
Richardson, Metallurgy Division). Two
standpipe tests with molten caustic
have been completed. One of the tests
with nickel and sodium hydroxide was
operated under vacuum and the other
under a hydrogen atmosphere. For the
test in vacuum, the maximum hot-zone
temperature was 820°C and a thermal
gradient of 140°C was maintained over
the length of the pipe. A moderate
amount of metal crystal formation
occurred, and some oxidation was
noted. The test under hydrogen, with
a maximum hot-zone temperature of
740°C and a temperature gradient of
140°C, showed neither mass transfer
nor oxidation,

FUNDAMENTAL CORROSION RESEARCH

Several fundamental approaches to
an understandingof corrosion phenomena
are being pursued. It i1s still too
early to say how successful these

studles'will be; however, simple,
free-energy and equilibrium-constant
‘ ~data have confirmed some of the ex-
‘J{perlmental results, for example,
" chromium, iron, andnlckel are attacked
by uranium tetrafluoride. Chromium

was the most severely attacked and
nickel the least. Measurements of the

potential differences between cells of

various fluorides are being undertaken.
Electrode potentials i1n sodium hy-

“droxide will be measured as a means
of ascertalnlng the purity or thermal
history of nickel, nickel oxide, and

sodium hydroxide. Polarographic
studies of the sodium hydroxide-nickel
oxide system will be undertaken if
preliminary tests are promising.

Table 33 lists the values of AF and
K and also approximate estimates of
the activity of the metallic fluoride.

These results indicate: sodium
fluoride is less corrosive than
potassium fluoride and the reaction
increases with temperature; chromium
is the most soluble of the metals
considered, iron is second, and nickel
last; and the trivalent cations are
slightly less reactive than the
divalent (however, from free energy
considerations the trivalent 1ons are
the more stable at the temperatures
considered).

Converting the values of a to parts
per million, a concentration of 10-1
ppm is found for Fe*? at 1000°K. This
figure is much less than the ex-
perimentally determined value (similar
results are found for the others), ‘and
if the activity of AF 1s corrected
(since mixtures of alkali fluorides
 

are used), the metallic fluoride

(MF) concentrations are further de-

creased. Thus;it'seems impossible to

Electrode Potentials in Fused
Sodium Hydroxide (Ambrose R. Nichols,
Jr., Materials Chemistry Division).
The apparatus previously described(®’
has undergone continued modification
over the past three months, It
consists of a nickel vessel within
which 1s placed a porous cup, which
divides the contents into two electrode
compartments. A nickel electrode is
suspended in each compartment., Chromel -
Alumel thermocouples in nickel walls
are located against the outer wall of
the nickel cup and in each of the
compartments. The whole assembly
si1ts at the bottom of a closed stain-
less steel container that rests in a
5-in. pot furnace. Helium purified
by passing over copper turnings at
450°C and through magnesium perchlo -
rate tubes 1s passed through the
container at a pressure slightly in
excess of atmospheric.

When a measurement 1s to be made,
the desired amounts of purified sodium
hydroxide and nickel oxide are weighed
in a dry box and placed in the two
electrode compartments of a nickel
container. The closed container is
then removed to the furnace and the
necessary connections made. Helium
circulation is started before heating
begins. After the chosen temperature
has been reached, the potential between
the two electrodes is determined by
using a type-K potentiometer, although
in some casesa recording potentiometer
has also been used.

The results have thus far not been
reproducible. The measured potentials
have changed with time, even to the
extent of reversal of polarity. It
was observed in each case that the
electrode in the more concentrated
solution developed a deposit of fine
nickel crystals, whereas that in the
more dilute solution appeared to have
undergone polishing. This mass
transfer has so far appeared to be
independent of temperature over the
narrow temperature range used.

Three principal experimental
difficulties exist and each could
account for the poor results: (1) fail-
ure to find a suitable diaphragm
material; (2) lack of knowledge of
the true nickel oxide concentration
in the solutions in whichthe electrodes
are placed; and (3) difficulty of
maintaining a uniform temperature

‘throughout the cell. Until these

problems are overcome, it 1is not
possible to ascertain the effect of
such factors as the purity or the
thermal history of the nickel, nickel

‘oxide, or sodium hydroxide.

Pélarbgraphy of Sodium Hydroxide
in Silver and Platinum (R. A. Bolomey,

Materials Chemistry Division). In
‘previous reports¢{®) it was stated

that anhydrous sodium hydroxide heated
to a temperature of 350 to 600°C in
either a silver or platinum crucible
in vacuum resulted in the production
of ionic species that gave character-
istic polarographic waves. It was
also mentioned that the voltage at
which the peaks occurred was tempera-
ture-dependent. To date, 85 polaro-
grams on sodium hydroxide in silver
crucibles and 88 polarograms on
sodium hydroxide in platinum crucibles
have been obtained. Even though all
the data were not obtained at the
same temperature, enough information
has been obtained to analyze the
reproducibility of the results. Such
an analysis revealed considerable

136

randomness in the waves and that the
curves of a given series show only
qualitative similarity.

The source of randomness in the
position of the polarographic waves
is not understood. It is possible
that it is to be found in the instru-
ment itself as a result of the method
employed to collect the data. At-
tempts to obtain the data by allowing
the readings to come to equilibrium
after each setting proved to be
impractical because of the slow rate
of equilibrium attainment. The present
me thod of collecting the data requires
that the potential on the cell be
varied at a uniform rate, since any
fluctuation in the rate of potential
changes can produce anomalous effects
on a current-voltage curve of the
type obtained with a polarograph and
stationary microelectrodes. It may
be that these anomalous effects are
more apparent when operating the cell
at the high temperatures required in
this work than when operating at room
temperatures in aqueous solutions.

Equipment for differential thermal
analysis has been gathered so that
preliminary tests may be made to study
the feasibility and applicability of
this method to the study of corrosion
mechanisms. It 1s intended first to
apply the method to the system sodium
hydroxide-nickel oxide under an inert
atmosphere.

Magnetic Susceptibility of Stain-
less Steel Exposed to Fluorides (W. C,
Tunnell, ANP Division). It has been
observed repeatedly that the surfaces
of all normally nonmagnetic steels
become magnetic after exposure to
high-temperature fluorides. Surface
layers have been removed and analyzed,
and it appears that the iron-to-
chromium ratio increased. A micro-
spectrographic analysis, under electro-
magnetization using a colloidal
dispersion of iron particles, revealed

the magnetic material to be at the
grain boundaries where intergranular
penetration had occurred.

In one test using a gasket ring of
type-316 stainless steel, the magnetic
surface was submerged in concentrated
nitric acid, and a 1- to 2-mil layer
of stronglymagnetic material separated
that was chemically analyzed as >90%
iron, 2.5% chromium, and 1.5% nickel.
The material under the layer was not
magnetic. In another test the hot

section of an Inconel loop that had

been exposed to Fulinak was examined,
since 1t seemed more magnetic than the
cold section. Immersion in con-
centrated nitric acid left pits and
made the material less magnetic, and
the remaining surface layer appeared
to be pure nickel. Another specimen

FOR PERIOD ENDING MARCH 10, 1952

of type-316 stainless steel that had
been in contact with Flinak became
porous after treatment with concentrated
nitric acid and lost all its magnetic
properties.

It may be concluded that, as 1in
most intergranular corrosion of stain-
less steels, the chromium 1s prefer-
entially leached at the grain bound-
aries, possibly by the usual device of
carbide precipitation, which exposes
excess 1iron and nickel for attack and
gives the magnetic susceptibility,
Photomicrographs appear to bear out a
phenomenon of this type. The attack
on iron always appears greater than on
nickel, as has been shown, for example,
by tests where the rate of penetration
appears to be proportional to the
amount of iron in the metal,

12. METALLURGY AND CERAMICS

W. D. Manly, Metallurgy Division
T. N. McVay, Consultant

The drawing of tubing from the
previously prepared solid fuel plates
has been accomplished, and the results
of the drawing on the bond continuity
and oxide distribution of the solid
fuel elements are discussed. From
this work it was found that the best
core material to use in the uranium
oxide mixture was iron powder. Com-
patibility experiments have shown
boron carbide to react rather ex-
tensively with the 300-series stain-
less steels and Inconel but to be
inert to type-430 stainless steel;
therefore the ARE safety rods will
probably be constructed of type-430
stainless steel. The solid-phase
bonding of metals is always difficult
with materials that are in intimate
contact at elevated temperatures.
Consequently, self-welding experiments
are being conducted on the possible
¢combinations of materials to be used
in the safety rods. '

The use of the cone-arc welding
process for the production of tube-
to-header joints is being investigated
to determine the applications and
limitations of the process, since
there is a need for a reliable auto-
matic or semiautomatic welding method
for the production of the many tube-
to-header joints in ANP core and heat
exchanger designs. A description of
the equipment and operating procedure
and a discussion of the variables
being studied are presented. Because
of the complexity of the ANP type of
heat exchangers, it i1s probable that
extensive brazing will be necessary
in fabrication. Preliminary work for
heat exchanger assemblies indicates
that brazing can produce sound joints
if proper control of the brazing
variables 1s exercised. Nicrobrazing

alloys, Pd-Ni, Mn-Ni, Ag-Pd, Ni-Cr-Sr,

I h
i‘;e‘ '.Mé' §~£:’

i

and Ni-Cr-Si-Mn, are being studied

and their corrosion in hydroxides and
fluorides is being investigated.
Since Inconel has been designated as
the structural material for the ARE
extension, rupture and creep data are
being obtained at the operating tem-
perature of the reactor. Data are
presented to show (1) the time re-
quired to produce deformations of
various percentages and for rupture to
occur as a function of the applied
stress for fine- and coarse-grain
Inconel, and (2) the minimum creep
rate and per cent deformation per
hour for the two types of Inconel

plotted as a function of applied

stress.

The oxide ceramics or combinations
of ceramics and oxides appear most
promising for reactor application be-
cause they offer the best combination
of structural integrity and thermal
properties. Ceramic coatings for
Inconel and stainless steel are being
tested. Of those tested, the NBS
Ceramic-Coating A-418, with its high
temperature and oxidation resistance
characteristics, shows promise as a
coating for the ARE radiator and pos-
sibly other structural parts.

technique may yet yield good, small,

Tests for solid-phase bonding
(self-welding) of the movable parts
of the ARE control rods at reactor
temperatures (1472°F) indicate a fair
amount of reaction between the boron
carbide type-316 stainless steel and
boron carbide Inconel systems in 100
hours. Of the few materials tested

type-430 stainless was the least

‘Cold Drawxng of Tubular SOlld Fuel
Elements. Tubular, solid, fuel ele-
ments fabricated by joining two seml-
circular laminated plates either with
seam welds or by "rubberstatic"(1)
pressing methods have been subjected
to cold-drawing operations at the
Superior Tube Company. All samples,
except the one prepared by rubberstatic
pressing, were given an initial hot
reduction of 62 to 75% to bond-pressed
core, picture frame, and cladding.
This operation was carried out on the
flat stock before forming into tubes.
The cores of the samples were 30 vol %
uranium dioxide and 70 vol % metal
(type-302 stainless steel, iron, or

nickel).

A reductlon schedule based on com- _

mercial practice was set up at values
ranging from 18 to 28% after a test
reduction of 38% caused a tube failure.
"The weld seams were satlsfactorlly
- smoothed in this pass, and the tubes
were subsequently reduced 87.5% in
seven passes, which yielded tubes of
1/4-in. OD by 0.015-in. wall thickness.
Three of these tubes were then further
reduced to yleld tubes 1/8 in.

graphic examination of specimens taken
from the tubes showed that bonding and
uranium dioxide distribution varied
from very poor to fair for tubes pre-
pared from rolled plate and was also
fair for one specimen prepared by
rubberstatic pressing. Sections trans-
verse to the direction of drawing are
shown in Fig. 42 at reductions of
87.5%, that is, for 1/4-in.-0D tubes.
In general, further reductions to
1/8-in.-0D tubing only exaggerated the
defects found in the 1/4-in.-0D stock.

Although plug drawing was not tried
on any of the composite tubes, 1t was
the opinion of some of the technical
staff at Superior Tube Company that
plug drawing would not disturb the
core of a laminated structure so much
as drawing on a mandrel, which was
the technique used in all drawings to
date. Rod drawing produces slip
cracks in the core because of slightly
uneven reduction of the two cladding
layers, but it i1s believed that plug
drawing should give uniform reduction.
Variation in the reduction schedules
used for these tubes will be tried by
using the Metallurgy Division draw-
bench and emphasizing less severe
reductions. Mandrels are now on order
to supplement dies already on hand.

. Equipment for plug drawing 1is not

avallable at present

ARE Control Rod. At the operating
temperature of the ARE, there exists
the possibility of solid-phase bonding
of metallic components that are in
close contact. This phenomenon could
possibly lead to malfunctioning of the
control rods if it occurred between
the control rod cladding and the walls
of the tubes in which they are housed.

ANP core and heat exchanger designs
is evident.

Equipment. The apparatus consists
of a G-E, 200-amp, direct-current
welding generator with the addition of
a resistor circuit that permits the
use of currents as low as 3 amp, 1if
desired. A Miller Electric Company,
high-frequency, spark-gap oscillator
provides the high frequency required
for starting the inert welding arc
without having to touch the 1% thoriated
tungsten electrode to the work. The
apparatus has been provided with a
timer and contactor control circuit
to render the arc timing an automatic
operation.

Principle of Operation. The cone-
arc welding technique is particularly
suited to welding a tube to a header
plate. The nozzle of the welder 1is
a permanent Alnico magnet that sets
up lines of flux to the tube and plate
over which the nozzle 1s held. Since
the welding arc will strike from the
electrode tip to a point on the
periphery of the tube, the arc stream
is cut by the lines of flux at a small
angle. This angle sets up resultant
forces tangential to the tube periphery
in the plane of the header sheet,
and the forces rotate the arc around
the tube at very high speeds. To the
observer the arc appears as a cone;
hence, the name "cone arc." The arc
raises the temperature of the tube
edge and the periphery of complete
header hole in a uniform manner until
the melting point its reached and a
circumferential weld results.

Experimental Procedure. Some of
the variables that may affect the
operation are:

1. Arc current and time,

2. Arc distance, which affects the
arc voltage and the angle between
the arc stream and the magnetic
lines of flux,

~arc was struck.

3. Magnetic nozzle to work distance,

4. Choice of inert gas and rate of
flow, which affect the arc voltage
(higher for helium than argon) and
the turbulence,

5. Work geometry, that is, tubing
' size, header thickness, and heat
transfer uniformity of header hole-
‘to-hole distance, hole-to-header-
edge distance, and centering of
work and electrode.

In the initial experiments header
holes without tubing were used, since
it was assumed that the behavior of
the arc in the formation of a circum-
ferential molten pool would yield
representative information with or
without a tube. The header material

‘used was type-304 stainless steel sheet

The limiting
value of permissible 'hole-to-hole
distance will probably be a function
of the arc current and time for a
given header thickness and hole size.
Experiments will be conducted to de-
termine these limiting values, since
ANP designs may require as small a
hole-to-hole distance as possible in
order to obtain the maximum number of
heat exchanger tubes per unit area of
header sheet.

The results from the few experiments
made were inconclusive, but it 1s ex-
pected that further work during the
coming quarter may yleld sufficient
information for a comprehensive study
of the quality of cone-arc welded,
tube-to-header joints as a function of
the welding variables.

BRAZING

Experiments were made to determine
the feasibility of brazing since 1t
is quite probable that this method may

dry hydrogen atmosphere, ‘with a dew

therefore moisture was ‘apparently the

It was suspected that if the hydrogen
continuously reduced any oxide and
there were subsequently moisture forma-

"tion in the hydrogen atmosphere, the

exit dew point of the hydrogen would
decrease with increasing flow rate.
A series of experiments proved this
hypothesis. Tests with an inlet-gas
dew point of -78°F and high hydrogen

" flow rates showed that exit dew points
‘approximating those at the inlet were

attained. The experiments were sig-
nificant in that they made it obvious

o

with a higher magnification,

that a relatively large hydrogen flow
rate during furnace brazing was de-
sirable. ' “

Corrosion of Brazing Alloys. The
resistance to corrosion of the various
brazing alloys, alone and in combina-
tion with various base metals such as
found in joints, is important in the
selection of suitable joining media;
therefore emphasis has been placed on
the results of corrosion tests of the
brazing alloys in fluorides and hy-
droxides. Extensive tests wereé con-
ducted on Nicrobraz, a boron-containing
alloy, which is an excellent brazing
alloy for use in conventional high-
temperature applications. Samples of
the pure alloy were subjected to
corrosion experiments in fluorides and
hydroxides and the baths were later
analyzed chemically for boron.

A sample of Nicrobraz treated in
sodium hydroxide for 100 hr at 1500°F,
showed the heavy corrosive attack
characteristic of this medium. There
was generally heavy surface attack to
a depth of 60 mils and severe local
attack. The sample tested in the
NaF-KF-LiF-UF, mixture for 100 hr at
1500°F was moderately pitted, par-
ticularly near the intermetallic
components, to a depth of 4 mils.
Other surface areas were relatively
untouched. Results of the chemical
analyses of the contents of both the
fluoride and hydroxide baths 1indicate
that boron is preferentially leached
from the alloy. An attempt will be
made to determine the actual percentage
loss of the boron from the alloy.

.The corrosion resistance of Nicro-
brazed tube-to-header joints with

Inconel as the base-metal has been

studied. A section of a tube-to-
header joint exposed to sodium hy-
droxide exhibited excessive attack
both at the brazed joint and on the
base-metal, as shown in Fig. 43e¢ and,
in Fig.

micrometer microscope having a least
division of 50 pin. was used to evalu-
ate this relative motion.

The time to produce deformations of
0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10% and the
time for rupture to occur, as a func-
tion of the applied stress for fine-
grained Inconel, are shown in Fig. 46.
Also presented is the minimum creep
rate in percentage of deformation per
hour as a function of the applied
stress. The percentages appearing
above the rupture curve are the total
elongations at the several stresses.
The fine-grained material was cold
rolled and bright annealed at 1650°F
to produce a grain size of approxi-
mately 0.105 mm (90 grains/mm?).
Similar data for the coarse-grained
Inconel-sheet specimens are presented
in Fig. 47, but the curve representing
the times to produce deformations of
10% is omitted since it is nearly
coincident with the rupture curve.
This Inconel sheet was annealed for
2 hr at 2050°F in a hydrogen atmos-
phere to produce a grain size of ap-

proximately 0.250 mm (15 grains/mm?).

Two separate creep rates were ob-
tained for the fine-grained specimens
tested at 3000 and 1850 psi; these
rates were observed during three
different tests. Linear sections
were observed on the strain-time
plots at 50 to 150 hr and again at
‘about 300 and 600 hours. The earlier
of the two linear periods exhibited
creep rates of one-third to one-half
of the rate found during the later
linear period.

Tube-Burst Tests. Three tube-burst
tests with tangential stresses of
about 1000, 3000, and 4000 psi, re-
spectively, have been running for ap-
proximately 1300 hr without developing
detectable leaks in the type-316 stain-
less steel tubes. These tubes, with
480 mils OD and 10-mil wall thickness,

148

were loaded internally'with‘argon
under pressure and exposed to an

‘environment of stagnant air. Since

no method exists to gage tubular
specimens during the test, the re-
sults will be based on before and
after measurements, ‘ - T

A second phase of this work is to
obtain data on physical properties of
metals in the fluorides. Apparatus
used for a similar study of sodium has
been modified and calibrated so that
fluorides may be used. Two tube-burst
tests were run in NaF-KF-LiF-UF, (10.9
mole % NaF, 43.5 mole % KF, 44.5 mole
% LiF, 1.1 mole % UF,) by using the
apparatus described in the previous ANP
quarterly report. Type-316 stainless
steel has withstood a hoop stress of
2320 ps1i and the Inconel 2170 psi. Both
these tests have been 1n operation
over 400 hours. Stress-to-rupture
tests in the same environment and
temperature but of 1000-hr duration
were also run on Inconel and type-316
stainless steel tubes. These materials
withstood hoop stresses of 1200 psi
and 1700 psi, respectively, and the

~diameters increased 1.7 and 0.7%,

respectively.

Operation of Creep and Stress-
Rupture Equipment. The center of
gravity of the lever-arm counter weight
on each testing machine was raised
approximately 2 in. above the plane of
the knife edges prior to making a
series of creep and stress-rupture
tests. With the counter weights thus
raised, the tare weight of the lever
arm was 1ncreased by the same amount
that the spring load of the compressed
sealing bellows was decreased, so that
a constant load could be maintained
during test. The 1initial, or tare,
load of each testing machine was
measured with wire strain gages
mounted on a duplicate specimen and
the constancy of the load was also
verified. '

CERAMICS LABORATORY

T. N. McVay, Consultant

Consideration of the possible appli-
cation of ceramics-coated materials

to reactors has indicated several po-

tentialities that require further
development. A ceramic coating has
been applied to a high-temperature
radiator and appears to offer excellent
oxidation resistance. Petrographic
examination of fluoride fuels is being
undertaken and additional equipment -~
mainly high-temperature furnaces -
have been added to the laboratory
facilities.

Ceramic Applications to Reactors.
Some general conclusions can be given
concerning the usefulness of ceramics
in reactors on the basis of an analy-
sis of their physical properties and

other information. ¢

1. Glass and glass-bonded ceramics,
which include nearlyall "conventional”
ceramics, are not useful in high-
temperature reactors as structural
elements because of a tendency to
soften at relatively low temperatures,
brittleness, poor mechanical and thermal
shock properties, and poor thermal
conductivities. However, 1f they can

"be used as liquids, grains, powder,

or coatings they may be considered.

2. Oxide ceramics generally have
most of the above-mentioned disad-
vantages, often to a lesser degree,
but they do not exhibit the tendency
to soften at low temperatures. All
the oxides with the exception of beryl-
lium oxide have thermal conductivities
considerably less than those of most

metals. If the thermal and Strﬁctural_

requirements are not too great and
the coolant corrosion problems can be

met, oxides may be used in reactors,
perhaps even as structural material.
Oxides in combination with other ma-
terials offer the greatest promise.

3. Carbides, nitrides, borides,
hydrides, and sulfides have been
investigated, but most of them need
further study. Beryllium carbide was
intensively investigated and developed
in the NEPA project and will be studied
further under G.E. It has many de-
sirable properties and if successfully
coated to prevent corrosion (particu-
larly oxidation) and loss of fissicn
products, should prove useful in high-
temperature reactors. Although many
of these unusual materials are very
refractory, they are also very re-
active at high temperatures, particu-
larly in the presence of oxygen and
water vapor.

4. Ceramic-metal combinations
(Cermets) have been studied intensively
by groups sponsored by the Air Force.
Both structural materials and coatings
have been developed. A few that have
shown promise are Al,0,-Cr, Al,0,-Fe,
Al,0,-Ni, MgO-Ni, and TiC-Co. The
Cr-Al1,0, Cermets have some interesting
properties such as reasonably high
strength at temperatures up to 2372°F
and very good oxidation resistance at
these temperatures. They are somewhat
brittle, however, and are not too
resistant to thermal shock. This
property depends on the oxide content.
Fabrication techniques have been well
developed for some shapes. Consider-
able further study will be necessary
to determine their usefulness in high-
temperature reactors.

Coatings for the Radiator. A con-
siderable amount of work has been
done this quarter in applying ceramic
coatings tostainless steel and Inconel,
since these may be required in a
liquid-to-air radiator. Much promise
for high-temperature and oxidation
resistance for reactor materials has

151

 

 
 

 

 

been shown by NBS Ceramic-Coating

'A-418. Samples coated to about 2 mils

thickness are currently undergoing
testing. The computed oxide composi-
tion of the frit (glass phase of the
coating) is:

Similar coatings developed for the
Air Force have been shown to protect
stainless steel at 2000°F for over
200 hr, or 1800°F for an almost in-
definite period. Testing procedures

for these coatings are described in

H. F. Poppendiek, Reactor Experimental Engineering Division

Viscosities of NaF-KF-LiF eutectic
have been determined over a wide
temperature range by utilizing three
types of viscometers that range from
about 8 centipoises at 550°C to 3
centipoises at 800°C. The addition of

~up to 30 wt % of uranium tetrafluoride

increased the viscosity of this
fluoride from 5 to 7 centipoises at
700°C but only from 4.0 to 4.3 centi-
poises at 800°C. Some preliminary
thermal conductivity information on
this coolant has also been obtained.
Heat capacity determinations have been
made for two different compositions of
NaF-BeF,-UF, mixtures over wide temper-
ature ranges. A table summarizing
physical properties of materials of
interest to ANP 1s included.

A series of corrosion failures has

made it impossible, for the present,

to obtain fundamental heat transfer
data for fused salts and hydroxides.

‘The heated-tube, lithium system has

been completed and 1s to be used to
determine heat transfer characteristics
for this coolant in the near future.
Some experimental boilingheat transfer

data for a mercury system have been

obtained.

The mathematical analysis of circu-
lating- fuel heat transfer for turbulent
flow has been evaluated for a series
of Reynold’'s and Prandtl’s moduli for
the case of no wall heat transfer.
Mathematical solutions for the natural
convection of liquid fuel elements have
been developed for turbulent flows.

The viscosity of the various fluoride
fuels proposed for the circulating-
fuel reactor is of great importance,
since a low value (less than 10 centi-
poises at 800°C) 1is required. The
mixture NaF-KF-LiF-UF, appears to meet
this requirement, whereas NaF-KF-UF,
does not.

Viscosity of NaF-KF-LiF. The
viscosity of the NaF-KF-LiF eutectic
(11.5 mole % NaF, 42.0 mole % KF,
46.5 mole % LiF) was measured by using
three different viscometers, a modified
Brookfield viscometer, an efflux unit,
and the previously described falling-
ball instrument.(!? The data ob-
tained(2+3) range from about 3 * 1

The thermal conductivity apparatus
was further checked by calibration with
a molten metal. The value of the
thermal conductivity of lead obtained
with this device agreed within 13% of
the value given in the literature.
Experiments to study Flinak (LiF-NaF-
KF eutectic) were initiated; however,
at the end of one run a corrosion
failure (attack on a weld and a stain-
less steel bellows) halted the experi-
mental work. The preliminary results
of this single run indicated that the
thermal conductivity of Flinak was
severalfold greater than that of the
fluoride heavily laden with uranium
(46.5 mole % NaF, 26.0 mole % KF, and
27.5 mole % UF,) that had been studied
previously. Modification of the
system will be attempted so that
corrosion will be minimized, Upon the
completion of this modification,
further thermal conductivity measure-
ments of the fluorides will be made.

A new, longitudinal flow apparatus,
originally developed to investigate
solids, has been erected. This device
will now be used for studing ligquids
with high thermal conductivities. Tt
is believed that the minor free-
convection currents that might occur
in this system will not significantly
influence the heat transfer (conduction
being the important heat transfer mode
in this case).

are in disagreement; therefore new
measurements were made between 1037
(slightly above the melting point)
and 1185°C., The apparatus and pro-
cedure employed were described previ-
ously.¢%*6) The data may be repre-
sented by the equation

log,, P(mm Hg) = (-9130.5/T) + 7.774 ,
which gives a maximum variation from
the measured values of 4.6%. The heat
of vaporization, as calculated from
the equation, is 42.1 kg-cal/mole.

In earlier work Johnson(7) used
a static method for determining
the vapor pressure of solid uranium
tetrafluoride, and Ryon and Twitchell(8)
measured a series of boiling points
at reduced pressures., The highest
vapor pressure obtained with the solaid
was approximately 6.5 mm at 1000°C,
but in the present work this pressure

"was observed at about 1040°C. The

boiling-point method gave a much
higher heat of vaporization than that
calculated from the data in this
report; that is, the pressures ob-
tained at higher temperatures were
considerably higher, and those obtained
at lower temperatures considerably

- lower, than the values reported herein,

The difficulty of obtaining reliable
boiling points in the low pressure
range and the fact that the points
were scattered m1ght account for some
of the differences.

 Wartenberg and Schulze.(®) The data
for sodium fluoride and potassium
fluoride, as well as the data reported
here for uranium tetrafluoride, were
extrapolated to 1267°C, the highest
temperature at which the vapor pressure
of the eutectic mixture was measured.

The ideal partial pressures at 1267°C of

each of the components of the mixture,
as calculated by Raoult’'s law, show
6.4 mm for sodium fluoride, 31 mm for
potassium fluoride, and 19 mm for
uranium tetrafluoride, The ideal
total pressure is therefore approxi-
mately 56 mm, whereas the experimental
vapor'pressure'at 1267°C is 11.6.¢5)

Assoc1at10n in the mixture probably
accounts for the large deviation from
ideal behavior. A 11ke1y poss1b111ty
is the presence of complex ions
formed by association of fluoride ions
and uranium tetrafluoride molecules.

Heat Transfer in Molten Lithium
(H. C. Claiborne and G. M. Winn,
Reactor Experimental Engineering
Division). The apparatus for measuring
heat transfer coefficients with an
electrically heated tube was completed.
Internal cleaning-and degreasing were
accomplished by thorough flushing with
ethanol and trichlorcethylene. The
system was outgassed by heating and
repeated flushing with argon scrubbed
with lithium and eutectic sodium-

"potassium alloy to remove the oxygen

The flush-
ing procedure consisted of raising the
pressure to about 35 psig with scrubbed
argon and bleeding the pressure down
to about 2 psig. After filling with
lithium, the system, when not in
operation, was kept under 35 psig with
scrubbed argon to prevent air con-
tamination,

and nitrogen contaminants,

Sixteen pounds of lithium was
added to the system through the filter
in 4-1b batches. The lithium used was
the low-sodium grade purchased from
To keep
contamination down to a minimum, the
film of nitrides and oxides adhering
to the 1-1b cylinders of solid lithium
was shaved off and the solid metal
soaked 1in trichloroethylene. This
operation was done in a dry box filled
with argon. The lithium was success-
fully pumped around the system (via
the test section by-pass) by the two
electromagnetic pumps in series, The
electromagnetic flow meter was cali-
brated by using the drain tank that
had been previously calibrated with
water,

obtaining heat transfer data, it was

not be passed through the test section,
Examination revealed that the test
section had melted at one point,.
Apparently too much current was passed

transformer circuit. A new test
section is being fabricated and other
minor changes are being made. Another
attempt to get heat transfer data will
be made as soon as this work 1is

caused leaks in several welds and in
one of the mixing pots, and'it was
necessary to replace these parts of
the system., A redesigned mixing pot
consisting of a section of 1-in. nickel
pipe 2% 1in, long and capped at both

at one end of the pot tangentially to

14. RADIATION DAMAGE

D. S. Billington, Solid State Divisien
A, J. Miller, ANP Division

Studies have continued on the
the effect of radiation on the sta-
bility of airplane reactor constitu-
ents. Considerable data have been
obtained from experiments in the X-10
graphite pile, the higher flux LITR,
and the Y-12 éyclotron. In all phases
of the work, preparations are being
"made to carry out additional studies

in the LITR and to utilize the MTR
facility when it becomes available.
This work has been concerned largely
with the stability of fused fluoride
"salt mixtures of the type proposed as
fuel for circulating fuel reactors.
In several of the inpile experiments
with the salts in Inconel capsules,
the rate of attack on the container
material has been considerably higher
than that observed in the out-of-pile
controls, However, the evidence is
not conclusive that the increased

corrosion rate is caused by the radia-

tion field.

Other radiation damage studies have
included inpile liquid metal loop
experiments and creep of metal. So-
dium was circulated in the 1inpile
loop for 165 hr, during which time
radioactive decay curves were taken.
The thermal condictivity of metals
under irradiation has also been
studied. The earlier creepand thermal
conductivity data have been partially
substantiated by recent tests. One
such creep test with nickel indicates
that the inpile creep rate becomes
higher than its bench counterpart after
about 115 hours. Additional details
on radiation damage studies are con-
tained in a quarterly report of the
Physics of Solids Institute. (!’

IRRADIATION OF FUSED MATERIALS

G. W. Keilholtz
Materials Chemistry Division

The effects of radiation on the
stability of fused fluorides in con-
tact with Inconel have been investi-
gated by use of the X-10 graphite
pile, the LITR, and the Y-12 cyclotron.
Reasonably detailed inspection of
materials from experiments carried out
in the X-10 graphite pile and cyclo-
tron at 1500°F showed no positive
evidence of fuel decomposition or
increased corrosion of the Inconel
when compared to out-of-pile control
tests. However, two fused fluoride
fuels irradiated in the LITR at power

densities of 800 and 84 watts/cc in

approximately 1/8-in.-ID tubes have
exhibited increases in the corrosion
rate as indicated by analyses of the
fuel for corrosion products. One of
these has the composition NaF-KF-UF,,
46.5, 26, and 27.5 mole %, respec-
tively, in which the power dissipated
when irradiated in the LITR is about
800 watts/cc of material. The second
fuel has a composition NaF-BeF,-UF,,
47, 51, and 2 mole %, respectively,
and a power dissipation of about 84
watts/cc. This is in the power range
of that occurring in the large-diameter
tubes of the proposed ARE. 1In both
cases there 1s some question as to
whether the inpile tests are being
carried out in a manner sufficiently
isothermal to prevent increased cor-
rosion rates by thermal gradients in
the capsules. In the case of the
low-uranium-concentration fluoride
mixture, irradiated at 84 watts/ce,
analytical results are available from
only one experiment. These results
are 1n sharp contrast to those from

an experiment on a similar beryllium
type of fuel containing a higher per-
centage of uranium, which had a power
dissipation of 554 watts/cc. The
latter experiment showed no evidence
" of increased corrosion, on the basis
" of an impurity analysis of the fuel,
as compared with the control.

Preparations are being made to
carry out studies on the escape of
xenon from the melt in the X-10 graph-
ite pile and on fuel stability in the

in Table 38. The corrosion of the
Inconel in some LITR runs is not only
deeper and more general than that in
the controls, but there are also two
kinds present - the intergranular-type
found in the control runs and a type
of corrosion that is confined within
the grain and shows evidence of being
preferential in the grains attacked.

The capsules are considerably cor-
roded above the point where the liquid
level is assumed to be. There 1is a
small amount of such corrosion in the
capsules irradiated in the X-10 graph-
ite pile but little evidence of cor-
rosion of Inconel in contact with the
vapor phase in control runs. Chemical
analyses in Table 38 indicate that
less chromium is dissolved in the

in 500 hr the creep strain would ex-

The beam deflection was measured with

test exceeded that of the inpile test
by 5%. Since this is contrary to what
would be expected from extrapolation
of the earlier data, the experiment
will be repeated.

RADIATION EFFECTS ON THERMAL
CONDUCTIVITY

A. F. Cohen L. C. Templeton
Solid State Division

In a preliminary relative thermal
conductivity experiment on Inconel,
previously reported,(4) a large de-
crease in thermal conductivity was
observed after three days of irradia-
tion at approximately 1517°F in the
X-10 graphite pile. To check this
result, a carefully annealed Inconel
specimen was irradiated at 482 and
1067°F and showed apparently no effects
from their radiation. When raised to
1517°F there was again some apparent
lowering of thermal conductivity, the
cause of which has not yet been de-
termined. In relative thermal con-
ductivity tests of high-purity cobalt-
free nickel in the X-10 graphite
pile, no lowering has been observed
during long periods at low tempera-
tures and several weeks of testing 1in
the region of 1500°F. An absolute
thermal conductivity test is being
run in the LITR at 1500°F on Inconel
that has been heat-treated to pre-
cipitate all the carbides that can
be precipitated by thermal treatment.

In an absolute thermal conductivity
test on type-316 stainless steel in
the fast flux of the LITR at 212 to
392°F the thermal conductivity was
shown to be unaffected by the irradia-
tion.

SUMMARY AND

The survey of the supercritical-
water reactor by the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory’s subcontractor, Nuclear
Development Associates, Inc.,, is com-
plete. NDA has concluded (sec. 15)
that a reactor of this type may be
developed for supersonic propulsion
but that the reacteor i1s an 1intricate
machine and will present a difficult
design job. Although OBNL will not
pursue this reactor cycle because of
the prevailing belief in the greater
potentialities of low-pressure liquid-
coolant reactors, NDA will continue
its work, together with Pratt and
Whitney, under direct AEC contract,

The large, analytical chemistry
program required in support of the

15. THE SUPERCRITICAL-WATER REACTOR

Nuclear Development Associates, Inc.

The supercritical-water cycle,
first proposed in Report Wash-24,(1)
has been under continuous 1investigation
by the Nuclear Development Associates,
Inc., for over a year.
completed their analysis of the super-
critical-water reactor for ORNL and a
final report has been written. (%)
This report concludes the subcontract
work by NDA for ORNL on the super-
critical-water reactor. NDA will,

‘however, continue its work in this

field in conjunction with Pratt and
Whitney Aircraft Division in a study
of the engine and hardware aspects of
this system. The conclusions and
recommendations in the final NDA report
are quoted in detail below. This
study was concerned only with the
reactor and shield; the power plant
and engine aspects of the proposal
are outside the scope of the present
summary. :

‘DESCRIPTION OF REACTOR
The reactor consists of a structure
of stainless steel plates immersed
in a vessel of water that is above
the critical pressure, so that it can
be heated to high temperatures without

- phase change. The plates contain the

fuel and provide surfaces for trans-
ferring the heat to the water. The
water serves several functions: it

is the coolant that carries away the

heat from the plates; it is the moder-
ator that slows down the neutrons in
the chain reaction; through variations
in its density 1t controls the re-
activity of the machine; it is the
neutron reflector that surrounds the

"reactor core; and it is the innermost

portion of the reactor shield.

CONCLUSIONS OF THE NDA STUDY

It is the conclusion of NDA that
it is possible to develop a reactor
of this type but that it is an intri-
cate machine and will present a dif-
ficult design job. NDA does not be-
lieve that this reactor represents an
easy short cut on the difficult road
to supersonic flight but that it may
offer one not-impossible path to that
goal. It is further stated that this
study represents only an early step
toward evolving such a reactecr and
definitely does not provide a pre-
liminary design ready for detailing.
An attempt is made to display the
potentialities of the machine and to
set forth at least some of the prob-
lems - the study has not solved the
problems. The impressions that have
been gained 1in regard to particular
items are:

1. The heat output (400,000 kw) re-
ported¢!’ appears attainable with
a reactor having a modest size
core (2.5-ft-square cylinder) and
a reasonable fuel inventory (20

kg).

2. The present estimate (85,000 I1b)
for the weight of a divided shield
with a crew compartment of 1in-
termediate size compares favorably
with the allowance (90,000 1b)
made in the report, or with the
somewhat higher weights allowed
for in the preliminary Boeing
studies.

3. This shield, like other divided
shields, does not permit normal
approach to the airplane after it
has landed. Additional awkward
shielding provisions are needed
for ground handling.

4. In view of industrial experience

with high pressures, the pressure

171

ANP DIVISION QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

(5000 psi) called for in this re-.

actor does not 1in 1itself appear
to constitute a major difficulty.
Departure from standard pressure

vessel practice will be neces-

sitated by the low-weight require-
ment in the present application;

“although this will pose important

design problems, it 1is thought
that they can be worked out satis-
factorily.

There is considerable experience
with water and stainless steel,
ahd, at least in the absence of
radiation effects, the use of these
materials appears to be quite
promising.

A type of fuel element ﬁlate under
development at ORNL appears promis-
ing for use in this reactor.

Incorporation of the basic fuel
plates into satisfactorily cooled
assemblies is a complex problem
that will require major effort.
The reactor calls for a very fine-
scale fuel-bearing structure
worked at tremendous heat load.

A particular difficulty is that

of maintaining equal temperatures
in parallel cooling streams be-
cause of their sensitivity (aris-
ing from the large expansion of
the fluid) to differences in heat
load or other quantities. This
tends to increase the amount by
which the maximum wall temperature

" exceeds the exit mixed temperature

172

of the coolant. Thus, the im-
portant temperatures are sensi-
tive to complex details of the
reactor power pattern and to 1im-
perfections in the design and
fabrication of the machine.

Variations in water density pro-
vide a substantial amount of
self-regulation, as well as a
convenient mechanism for slow

10.

11.

external control of the reactor.
The machine appears quite amenable
to control under steady condi-
tions.

A detailed study of startup pro-
cedure, which would also involve
the power plant, has not been
made. However, it appears pos-
sible, with only density controls,
to start up the reactor when it
is attached to a simple external
system, - '

A useful amount of shim control
can, in principle, be obtained by
variation of water density 1in
the reactor. However, the effects
of density change upon the power
pattern (cf. 8 above) have not
vet been investigated, and 1t may
prove desirable to incorporate
mechanical or other slowly acting
controls to assist 1in startup or
in shim control.

RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE NDA STUDY

If the supercritical-water reactor

is deemed sufficiently promising to
be of further interest for aircraft
or other applications, the following
recommendations for further work are
in order: :

16 . ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY

C. D. Susano
Analytical Chemistry Division

The major portion of the effort in
the field of Analytical Chemistry 1is
concerned with the analysis of ternary
and quaternary eutectics composed of
alkali-metal, beryllium, and uranium
fluorides that have been subjected to
corrosion tests 1n stalinless steel
and nickel alloy containers. Studies
made during the past quarter led to
revisions in the methods for the de-
termination of uranium, iron, nickel,
chromium, manganese, and molybdenum.
The revised methods are yielding satis-
factory results. The determinations
of beryllium, total alkali metal,
fluoride, and silicon present more
serious problems, but progress 1is
being made in the modification of
existing methods or the development
of new methods for determining these
constituents. The feasibility of
separating beryllium from uranium by
the use of anion exchange resins is
being studied, with very promising
results. A method has been worked out
for the determination of fluoride,
which, it is believed, will show a
marked improvement in accuracy and
expenditure of time over the presently
used pyrohydrolysis method. Efforts
are being made to adapt the colori-

metric silico-molybdate method for
‘the determination of silicon in fluo-

ride eutectlcs

Several further attempts to remove

‘boron from diatomaceous earth by

washing with hydrochloric acid have
shown that the boron content can be
reduced to 50 ppm or less.

: STUDIES OF DIATGMACEOUS EARTH

J. C. Whlte W, J Boss
Analytical Chemistry Division

Several attempts to remove boron
from one type of diatomaceous earth

(with the trade name "Sil-0-Cel") by
washing with hydrochloric acid in
concentrations from 33 to 67% resulted
in lowering the boron content from
300 ppm to 50 ppm or less. This in-
vestigation has been hampered by the
lack of a more sensitive method for
the determination of boron in quanti-
ties less than 50 ppm; therefore the
ultimately possible reduction of the
boron content is indeterminate at this
time.

A method for the determination of
boron that involves the color complex
between boron and 1,1'-dianthrimide in
sulfuric acid(!’ is more sensitive
than the spectrographic method being
used, but its application to diato-
maceous earth samples has not been
successful,

ANALYTICAL STUDIES OF

J. C. White C. K. Talbott

The major portion of the effort for
the ANP program in the field of Ana-
lytical Chemistry 1s concerned with
the analysis of ternary and quaternary
eutectics composed of alkali-metal,
beryllium, and uranium fluorides that
have been subjected to corrosion tests
in stainless steel and nickel alloy
containers. Determinations of uranium,
beryllium, total alkali metals, and
fluorides are made for the purpose of
following possible changes in compo-
sition of the eutectics, and detérmina-
tions of impurities such as iron,

ANP DIVISION QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

nickel, chromium, manganese, and molyb-
denum are required in order to de-

termine the extent of corrosion of
the metal container. Since the pres-

ence of silicon in these mixtures
has been detected by examination with
. the mass spectrometer, methods of
determining silicon are also being
deve loped. The adaptation of existing
methods of analysis to the fluoride
eutectic type of sample has been the
principal problem of the group.

Uranium. The determination of
uranium in fluoride eutectics is
being satisfactorily accomplished by
the potentiometric method of titrating
uranium(IV) with ferric sulfate. (2’

Béryllium."The separationtxfberyl-
lium from uranium is generally based
on the selective precipitation of one
component, such as the precipitation
of beryllium hydroxide in carbonate
solution. The determination of beryl-
liam is ordinarily completed gravi-
metrically by precipitation of the
hydroxide, but a volumetric procedure
‘would be preferable. The feasibility
of separating beryllium from uranium
by the use of anion exchange resins is
being studied. Both column and batch
tests, with the use of Dowex-1 1in the
chloride and sulfate forms, have in-
dicated that uranium is adsorbed by
such resins and that beryllium is not
adsorbed. Such a separation will
permit the direct titration of beryl-
lium.

Another method for the separation
of uranium and beryllium, recommended
by Fischer (reported by Rodden(?’),
depends upon the extraction of the
uranium salt of l-nitroso-2-naphthol
with amyl alcohol. This method will
be 1nvestigated.

Chemistry of the Manhattan Project, p. 70-71,
. McGraw-Hill, New York (1950).

‘Total Alkali Metals. In the pro-
cedure now in use, all the cations
except the alkali metal ions are pre-
cipitated by NH,OH from a sulfate
solution of the eutectic and evaporated,
and the alkali metals are weighed as
sulfates.

Total Fluoride. The determination
of total fluoride in the eutectics is
accomplished by hydrolysis of the
powdered eutectic in the presence of
U;04 and steam at 1000°C, followed by
the titration of the hydrogen fluoride
contained in the distillate.

The préblem of removing interfering

~ions 1s well on the way to being

solved by a method that involves fusion
of the material with sodium carbonate.
Leaching the carbonate fusion mixture
with water dissolves the fluorides,
which can then be separated from the
insoluble residue by filtration.
Beryllium, uranium dioxide, and all
the metal impurities except molybdenum,
generally a very minor component, are
retained in the residue. Fluoride 1is
precipitated in the filtrate as lead
chlorofluoride, which may be dried and
weighed. Alternatively, a volumetric
determination of chloride, after dis-

solution of the precipitate in nitric’

acid, also yields the fluoride content.
Recovery of fluoride was from 99.3 to
100.6% complete when the chloride
concentration ranged from two to five
times the theoretical amount. The
volumetric method is less satisfactory,
and further work is being done to
correct its deficiencies. =

The carbonate fusion method offers
two main advantages over the hydrolysis
procedure: (1) it is more adaptable
to use on a large scale, 1in that 1t
requires no special equipment and 1is
more rapid, and (2) it permits the
determination of a number of constitu-
ents on the same sample; in fact, when
necessary, all the desired constituents

~

e

 

 
 

 

R i i i

-

can be determined on a single sample
of the fused mixture.

Nickel. The dimethylglyoxime method
being used for the colorimetric de-
termination of nickel employs special
treatment for application to fluoride
eutectics.¢®

Chromium. The use of diphenyl-
carbazide to form a violet complex
with chromium(IV) for the colorimetric
determination of chromium 1is well
established; choice of a suitable
oxidant, unfortunately, is not. Per-
manganate has been used satisfactorily
in this capacity, but sodium bismuthate
has also been extensively studied.

Manganese. The colorimetric method
for the determination of manganese (*’
prescribes the use of sodium bismuthate
as the oxidant to produce permanganate
ions. This method, however, has
proved unsatisfactory for the corro-
sion-test samples currently being
received, because they have been found
to contain high chromium-to-manganese
ratios. As an alternative, the
periodate method has been studied and
found to be more applicable, owing
chiefly to the possibility of re-
tarding the oxidation of chromium
without affecting the oxidation rate
of manganese through the control of
the acidity of the system.

Silicon. In the colorimetric de-
termination of silicon, the complex
molybdosilicic acid is extracted with
either butyl or amyl alcohol, and the
molybdenum blue complex is measured
spectrophotometrically. Although this

‘method yields results that are some-

times difficult to duplicate, it is

widely used for the determination of
soluble silicon in low concentration
ranges.

Dissolution of the fluoride eutectic
to yield all the silicon in the form
of soluble silica is a critical step.
Hoffman and Lundell(®’ made a thorough
study of the determination of silicon
in the presence of fluoride and recom-
mended sodium carbonate fusion of the
solid. Small concentrations of sili-
con can be leached out of the fusion
mixture with water. The use of this
method in preliminary tests 1indicated
the presence of substantial quantities
of silicon 1n certain fluoride eutec-
tics. Aneffort 1s being made to adapt
the method for application to the
fluoride eutectics and to the indi-
vidual components of the eutectics.

SOLUBILITY OF BORIC ACID IN WATER

A. P. Fraas
ANP Division

G. F. Petersen

The solubility in water of the
boric acid, H;BO;, is so low that the
increase in the water density 1is
slight. However, by adding 11.85 g
of lithium hydroxide to 100 ml of
water, 1t was possible to effectively
dissolve 66 g of boric acid per 100
ml of water, with a resulting density

of 1.2 g/cc. This method has been
considered as a device for reducing
shield weight.

CLARITY OF BORATED WATER

Little work was carried out on this
project during the quarter, and no
further work is planned because the
use of borated water is no longer
contemplated in the ARE.

STUDIES OF ALKALI AND ALKALINE
EARTH HYDROXIDE COOLANTS

J. C. White

Analytical Chemistry Division

No work has been done on analytical
methods applicable to alkali and alka-
line earth hydroxide coolants this
quarter because of the increased em-
phasis on the study of fluoride
eutectics. '

: J. W. Robinson

AnélYfidal Chemistry Division

Analytical service work is now
centralized in the ANP analytical
Chemistry Laboratory in Building

9201-2. Over 70% of the samples.

analyzed this quarter were from reactor
chemistry studies of reactor fuels and
coolants, Emphasis shifted from
alkali and alkaline earth hydroxides
to fluorides, uranium, alkali metals,
and corrosion products in various
fluoride salt mixtures. Other determi-
nations, such as the purity of salt
mixtures, oxygen in helium and argon,
and 1ron in beryllium oxide, were also

‘made. A summary of service analyses

performed is shown in Table 39.
