Please find attached a list of reports, papers, and memos
received by the MSRP office during the period January-March 19T7kL.
We will issue lists of this type at monthly intervals.

I am also enclosing copies of previous Reports Received lists
covering the period September 1966 through June 1973. Copies of

the MSR memos and papers can be obtained from the MSRP office
(3-62T4). Copies of the ORNL, TM, and CF reports can be obtained

from Laboratory Records.
