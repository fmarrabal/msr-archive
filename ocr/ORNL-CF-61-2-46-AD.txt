ADDENDUM TO ORNL CF-61-2-46,
MOLTEN-SALT REACTCR EXPERIMENT PRELIMINARY HAZARDS REPORT

Since the "MSRE Preliminary Hazards Report" was written (February
1961), several changes have been made in the MSRE design, and additional
information has been requested by the AEC Division of Reactor Develop-
ment. It is the purpose of this Addendum to up-date and correct the
original report and to provide the additional information.

Each section of this memorandum provides revised or additional in-
formation for a section with the same heading in the original, which
should be referred to for a full understanding of the revisions.
Appendix A lists specific information requested and indicates where the
topics are discussed in the report.
-

2. REACTOR COMPLEX
2.1 General Description

The arrangement of the equipment within the reactor cell has been
modified significantly. The pump has been moved from the top of the
reactor and relocated to the east., This change is considered to be an
improvement because:

(1) The design of the control rods and their mechanisms is greatly
simplified, because the top of the reactor vessel is clear.

(2) The graphite samples located at the center of the reactor may
now be removed without having to remove the pump also.

(3) Remote inspection of the graphite and other parts remaining
within the vessel is much easier.

The sizes and wall thicknesses of INCR pipes used in various portions
of the reactor have been changed so that except for a few special cases
wall thicknesses have been increased to the equivalent of Sch.-40 pipe.

2.2 Fuel and Materials

More recent information about the fuel and coolant salt, INOR-8,
and graphite is shown in the revisions of Tables 1, 2, and 3.

2.3 Reactor Vessel

An access port of 10-in. diameter replaces the fuel outlet shown
in Fig. 3. The new outlet is a branch off this port. A hollow plug fits
into the port, serving as support for control-rod thimbles and graphite-
sampling devices. The core graphite configuration was slightly altered,
as shown on the new Fig. 4. The top core shield has been removed. Its
original purpose was to provide shielding between the reactor and the
pump. A revised table of Design Data is included as Table 4,

2.4 Fuel and Coolant System Pumps
A revised Data Sheet is presented in Table 5,
2.5 Primary Heat Exchanger

A revised Design Data Sheet is included (Table 6).

2.6 Salt-to-Air Radiator

Although the radiator design has not changed, the enclosure has been
modified to provide more protection against freezing of coolant salt in
the radiator. The two sliding doors on the radiator enclosure now operate
individually; thus cooling will be drastically reduced by closure of either
one of the two doors. The heat losses with one door up is only 130 kw
when the fans are off. Furthermore, the closing time of the doors has been
reduced to less than 10 seconds. A revision of Fig. 7 is attached, along
with revisions of Table 7,

2.7 Drain and Storage Tanks

A revised Design Data Sheet and a revision to the Coolant Thimble
Drawing (Fig. 9 R) are presented.

2.8 Cover-Gas System

The charcoal beds are designed to retain the fission gases until all
have decayed except the 10.6-yr Kr-85. A maximum discharge rate of 7 curies/
day Kr-85 is expected. The concentration of the gas in the stack will be
only 10-2 pcuries Kr-85/cc, which is the maximum permissible concentration
for this isotope in air. Dilution in the stack jet will reduce the con-
centration by a factor of at least 100. The stack gases will be moni-
tored for particulate activity by a standard air monitor which filters a
side stream of approximately 1 cfm and counts the activity of the material
collected from the filter paper. The activity level will be recorded and
an alarm will be provided, so that action may be taken in case permissible
concentrations are exceeded.,

According to the available experimental evidence, elemental iodine
will not exist in the salt and therefore will not be present in the gas
phase. However, frequent samples of the off-gas will be analyzed for
composition, and monitors for specific contaminants such as iodine will be
added if necessary.

An instrument application diagram of the cover-gas system is pre-
sented in Fig. 10A. Rupture discs are provided at several stages of
pressure reduction, so that the reactor piping is protected against
pressures above 50 psig.

cient of reactivity, and to provide for fuel penetration into the graphite,
and control of the critical reactor temperature over a 300°F range. Slow
penetration by fuel will be compensated by burnup and poison additions
via the enricher-sampler.

The following sources and amounts of reactivity will require the
use of control rods for shimming.

Three control rods will be used. Each control rod has a maximum
worth, when inserted with all other rods withdrawn, of 0.025-%35 !
Their combined worth is 0.046 % . The maximum rate of withdrawal for
a single rod is 0.0002 E%EEET . With three rods inserting as a group,
the meximm rate of poisoning will be 0.0005 Tii— .

All rods are identical and any one of the_zggée may be used as a
servo-operated shim for automatic control purposes. The operation of
the control rods and the reactor will be subject to restrictions as
follows:

l. The reactor may not be filled or operated routinely unless

two rods are fully withdrawn.
2. Only one rod may be servo-operated at a time.

3. No rod may be switched to servo-operation unless the other

two rods are fully withdrawn.

The rods are centrally located and move vertically. Figure 14-A
is a horizontal section through the core showing rod locations and the
location of the graphite irradiation samples.

Figure 14-B is a vertical section through a control rod. In
essence, the rod is a hollow, contained cylinder of mnatural boron car-
bide, B,C (19% B'®). The outside diameter of the B,C cylinder is 0.990.
The cylinder is formed by stacking a series of small cylindrical sections
(Pec. 1, Fig. 14-B), each clad with INOR and having an overall length of
1.625 in. This construction provides a degree of articulation. The re-
sulting limited flexibility greatly reduces problems associated with
guide-tube tolerances and differential expansions in both tube and rod
which are a consequence of radial flux and temperature gradients. The
flexible Inconel hose (Pc. 9, Fig. 14-B) centers and retains the indi-
vidual cylinders comprising the stack. The slight misalignment between
individual cylinders which can result from the nominal 0.020 in. radial
clearance between the hose and absorbing cylinders will not affect the
operation of the rod.

A flexible cable (Pc. 6), to which has been added a coarse pitch
spiral of larger wire, supports and drives the rod. The wire wrap is
used as gear teeth and the flexible cable becomes, functionally, a
flexible rack. This flexibility allows the drive mechanism to be lo-
cated on top of the thermal shield instead of the area immediately over
the reactor vessel.,

The assembly operates inside a 2-in. outside-diameter INOR-8 thimble
which penetrates the core, The thimbles for the three rods and the
graphite sample are part of a larger assembly, Fig. 14-C, which is cen-
trally mounted on top of the reactor vessel. The three control rods
and the graphite sample assembly are incorporated into a flanged module
which is bolted to the reactor vessel. Containment is effected by a
metal "0" ring and an annular frozen salt seal having an effective length

of over 20 in. The seal is kept frozen by air-cooling on both sides
of the annulus. Two blowers in parallel provide cooling air to this
assembly and to other parts of the reactor.

Heating in the control rod poses no problems.* In fact, without
any external cooling the maximum temperature with éhe reactor at 10 Mw
has been calculated as 1427°F. In adhering to conservative design
practice, cooling air (3.3 cfm per rod) is provided by the same system
used to supply air to the outside of the entire assembly.

In general, this control-rod concept is the same as that success-
fully used in the ARE, - Stressés are conservative, heat generation and
transfer have been calculated and provide no problems; neither does gas
evolution from the ch' A model will be thoroughly tested in salt at
operating temperatures before the final design is accepted.

(f) Reactor Control Operation, The fuel system of the MSRE has a
very large heat capacity, and as a result a relatively large change in
power production is required to raise the temperature of the fuel. For
this reason, at low reactor power, the temperature coefficient of the
fuel does not produce a tight control on reactor power. For maiﬁtaining
a constant power at low-power levels, it is necessary to control the
reactor by an automatic servo, the input signal for which is taken from
a radiation sensor such as an ion chamber. This servo input signal will
have an adjustable setpoint so that the operator may choose the power
level at which the servo system is to hold the reactor.

At power levels near design point, the temperature coefficient does
exercise adequate control and, in order to allow the reactor to respond
to load demands, the flux' must be permitted to change. The servo then
is used to assist in maintaining a constant mean reactor temperature.
For this mode the mean reactor temperature is fed to the servo as an
input signal. This signal also is made adjustable so the operator again
can set the temperature point to which the servo controls the reactor.

 

TR Westsik, Temperature Distribution in Control Rod with No
Cooling, MSR-61-54 (May 17, 1961).
= 0l

If some unforeseen anomalous condition should put the reactor on
a fast period, it would be desirable to have the servo correct for such
a condition, Therefore under the power regime a derivative flux signal
is mixed with the temperature input to the servo,

With the reactor temperature on automatic control, the reactor may
be loaded at will by the operator. He has manual control of the radi-
ator doors, the radiator blowers and the bypass duct damper. There are
however over-riding signals which take corrective action should the
operator manipulate the heat extraction system improperly.

Thermocouple signals on the radiator outlet first alarm in case
the temperature drops to approximately 1020°F, next shut off blowers,
then drop doors and turn on radiator heaters if the temperature reaches
1000°F. This is still approximately 150 degrees above the freezing
point of the fuel. Loss of coolant flow results in similar action.

On the reactor outlet pipe, thermocouples provide an over-ride
signal also. If the reactor outlet temperature exceeds approximately
1230 degrees, the servo is disengaged and locked out, and allvthree
rods are inserted. When the outlet temperature drops below this point,
the rods stop their insertion but the servo does not re-engage until
the operator gives manual permission.

The servo-operated control rod will be kept in range by adding
U-235 in small quantities as described in Section 2.10, This is to
be done by administrative control.

3.2.3 DNuclear Instruments

Since the publication of ORNL CF-61-2-46 (refer to Fig. 14, p 40),
the nuclear instrumentation has been altered by reducing the number of
penetrations from three to one, Fig.l4R. The large southeasterly water-
filled penetration which houses four chambers is retained. The chamber
complement will be two fission chambers and two compensated ion chambers,
These will provide coverage over the full range of reactor operation
and will provide the necessary input signals of reactor level and per-
iod.

This reduction in both the number and location of nuclear input
channels does not compromise ultimate safety which, in the MSRE, is not
vested in the control-rod system.

The arrangement of all chambers in a single penetration is identi-
cal to the arrangement used successfully in the HRE-2,

3.2.9 Process Monitoring System

 

A system is being designed to continuously scan the important in-
strument signals throughout the reactor complex. When predetermined
limits at any sensing element are exceeded, an alarm will be sounded
so that the operator will be informed and can take corrective action.

3.3 Control System Interlocks

Interlocks will be of two types. First, there will be those which
are designed to help maintain system safety and integrity; second, those
which are employed to aid the operators in maintaining other system
parameters at their proper values. Some of those in the second group
will be in force only during start-up; and will be switched out once
routine operation is established. These will be designated as "permissive
to start”. -They will continue to provide an annunciator or other form
of operator notification at all times.

The most important interlocks are listed below. This listing is
preliminary and many limits have not yet been specified. It will be
revised before the final design is complete.

5. THE REACTOR COMPLEMENT
5.2 Containment

As discussed on pages 44 and 46 in ORNL CF-61-2-46, the MSRE has
been designed with three barriers to the escape of fission-product activ-
ity. Fuel is contained in the reactor piping and vessels., The reactor
primary equipment is installed in the reactor and drain-tank cells which
form a completely sealed containment during operation. The third barrier,
zones of controlled leakage, can now be specified in more detail. The
controlled zones are located wherever lines penetrate the containment
cells, They include the high-bay area above the cells, and the auxiliary
equipment rooms on the southeast side, the coolant equipment room on the
south side and the instrument room on the north side of the reactor cell
(see Fig. 18 Rev.). The high-bay area is lined with steel sheets welded
at the joints to limit the leakage to less than 1000 c¢fm at 0.3 in, HEO'
The other rooms have concrete or steel-lined walls, and each of these
rooms is designed for low leakage by gasketing of the doors, sealing of
all service penetrations and by having internal heating and cooling.

Each zone is kept at a negative pressure by the ventilating fan-—
filter system described below. This guarantees that, when the fans are
running, activity leaks will be discharged to the atmosphere after fil-
tration. It also keeps outleakage to a minimum if the fans are off; the
outleakage is first into the standard building and then to the outdoors.

The driving force for the ventilation system is located outside the
reactor building and consists of two 21,000-cfm fans arranged in parallel,
so that in case of failure of one fan the other fan starts automatically
to provide uninterrupted ventilation. Both fans pull through a bank of
chemical -warfare-service filters which are capable of removing parti-
cles down to at least 1 micron in size; in a fission-product spill the
noble gases are the principal activities which escape the filters. This
type of filter system is employed at other reactor installations at the
Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The fans discharge the filtered air to
a 100-ft-high stack.

VEN TILATION

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-[}E_
- 37

The ventilation system is designed for several purposes:

(1) During normel operation when the reactor and drain-tank cells
are sealed off, the ventilation system exhausts from the building at a
rate of 18,000 cfm and maintains a slight negative pressure (~.0.1 in, H20)
on the limited leakage zones outside the containment vessel,

(2) During an accident in which fission gases leak from the con-
tainer into the high bay, the building inlet supply is stopped and the
ventilation fans exhaust only the building inleakage, estimated to be
< 1000 efm at 0.3 in. HEOo

(3) During maintenance when the containment cells are opened, the
ventilation system maintains an air flow of approximately 100 ft/min
through the opening (in the containment cells) through which maintenance
work is performed. This 100-ft/min flow of air is intended to prevent
the transfer of fission-product gases and radiocactive particles from in-
side the container out into the working area of the building.

(4) During normal operation the ventilation system serves to di-
lute the small quantity of fission-product gases which are removed from
the reactor charcoal beds. Since the stack flow is 21,000 cfm, and only
a few cubic centimeters of fission gas are discarded each day, the di-
lution factor is approximately 1011. The stack itself as it discharges
into the atmosphere provides another factor of 100 to 1,000 dilution,
depending on the weather conditions which prevail at the time.

5.2.1 Fuel System Container Design

The drain-tank cell is a reinforced concrete structure with a mini-
mum design pressure of 40 psig. It will be tested at 1.2 times the de-
sign pressure, or at 48 psig in a hydrostatic test. The reactor cell will
also be tested at this pressure, because the two cells are joined by a
large opening.

5.3 Shielding

Originally the top shielding of the reactor vessel consisted of 7 ft

of ordinary concrete, which was sufficient to shield the area directly

above the reactor vessel to levels of approximately 90 mr/hr. The effect-
iveness of this shielding has now been increased by using high-density
- 38 -

concrete for the lower 3-1/2 ft. This is equivalent to adding 1-1/2 ft
of ordinary concrete; it reduces the radiation level to 2.5 mr/hr. This
change has been made even though the area in question will not normally

be an occupied zone.

5.4 Arrangement of Equipment

As has already been mentioned, the equipment within the reactor cell
has been rearranged, and the piping sizes and wall thicknesses increased.
The drain and flush tanks have also been rearranged to give greater ac-
cessibility for maintenance. The new version is shown on Figs. 18, 19,
19-A, and 19-B.

6. CONSTRUCTION, STARTUP, AND OPERATION
6.3 Startup

One of the most important investigations to be made during the
initial critical experiment will be the determination of the tempera-
ture coefficient. It is realized that the safety of the reactor is
determined largely by the value of this coefficient, and for this
reason it is considered extremely important that an indication of the
value of the temperature coefficient be obtained at the earliest possi-
ble stage of the experimental program.

6.6 Reactor Shutdown

The reactor may be made subcritical by raising the fuel salt
temperature, insertion of control rods, injection of nuclear poison
through the sampler-enricher or by draining the salt from the circu-
lating system into the drain tank or a combination of the above methods.
Normal shutdown procedures will call for cessation of power extraction,
heating the salt to make the reactor subcritical, then draining to the
drain tanks.

The control-rod drive may be fed power from any of the two TVA
circuits, the diesel generators, or the emergency instrument power
supply. Insertion of any one of the three rods is sufficient to over-
ride the combined effects of delayed neutrons and xenon plus samarium,
It is not desirable to reduce the critical temperature of the fuel salt
below the freezing point of the salt by either of the poisoning means.

In cases of emergency the fuel salt will be transferred into the
drain tank (see 3.3.1l.k). “Provisions have been made to assure that
draining may be accomplished without the need of electrical power. The
drain tanks and drain line are kept hot by resistance heaters which are
monitored for temperature and electrical continuity. The drain lines
are emptied from salt (after a startup) by venting through a pipe con-
nected to the gas space of the pump bowl and to the drain line just
below the freeze valve, The drain valve is located near the reactor
and inside the insulated furnace space; cooling from an air jet is re-

quired to maintain the freeze plug. Therefore, a loss of power accident
 

B -

will not prevent draining of the system. Experiments indicate that
salt flowing at several feet per second will not freeze in pipes of
the drain-line size (1-1/2 IPS) even if they are cold when flow begins.

Emergency shutdown of the reactor in the event of a plugged drain
line is discussed in section 7.1.6. f.
i) s

7. HAZARDS ANALYSIS
7.1 Damage to the Primary Container
7.1.1 Reactivity Excursions

(a) Startup Accident. The final design of the control circuits
which protect against the startup accident is not yet available, A pre-
liminary list of interlocks is presented in section 3.3 of this Addendum,

(b) Graphite Problems. Changes in reactivity which result from
penetration of fuel salt into the graphite, shrinkage of the graphite
and breakage of the molybdenum bands were discussed previously. Sub-

 

stitution of fuel for graphite as a result of attrition of the graphite
and its removal from the core has been considered also. Calculations
indicate that there would be little or no change in reactivity for an
increase from 22.5 to 27 volume % of fuel salt in the core and that the
reactivity would decrease with further substitution of salt for graphite.
Mixing of graphite with the fuel would not create criticality problems in
other reactor equipment.

The problem of maximum fission-product heating of the graphite was
also discussed, and it was reported that the graphite might reach 2000°F
after 200 hours if it contained 6 volume % of fuel. Precautions are
listed to protect against possible dangers.

The more realistic case of 1 volume % of fuel in the graphite has
been calculated also. After 200 hours the maximum temperature could
reach approximately 1&50°F; There will be many thermocouples on the
reactor vessel, and it is planned to install a thermocouple in one of
the graphite sample pieces near the center of the core so that the
graphite temperature can be observed directly. The graphite will be
cooled with flush salt and will not be exposed to the atmosphere until
the temperatures are satisfactorily low.

7.1.3 Flow Stoppage K2

(a) Fuel-Circulation-Pump Failure, Probably the most serious
aspect of circulation-pump failure is the possibility that a slug of fuel
will be drastically cooled in the heat exchanger. If the pump were
- 45 -

restarted with this situation existing, the "cold slug" would enter the
reactor and immediately increase the reactivity. Simulator studies of
this "cold slug" accident indicate that the power would rise to 17 Mw
within a few seconds, but would return to 10 Mw within 12 seconds if

no corrective action were taken. Actually, the control rods would be
automatically inserted by the high-power (set at 15 Mw) interlock and
the period interlock. Additional protection against this incident will
be provided by interlocks, which (1) close the radiator doors and heat
up the coolant salt whenever the fuel pump fails, (2) cause a lockout
of the fuel pump "start" button until the reactor temperature has re-
turned to normal, and (3) cause an automatic run-down of the motor-
generator-set frequency so that when the pump is restarted it will be
started at reduced speed.

7.1.5 Drain-Tank Hazards

 

In addition to the accidents considered in this section, a question
was raised about whether water could enter the drain tanks and cause a
criticality incident. The present design of the drain-tank cooling
system appears to make this sort of accident impossible, As was des-
cribed on pages 23 and 24, there is an air space between the cooling
tubes and the salt-tank thimbles. This space is vented directly to the
drain-tank cell, so that water which leaks from the cooling tubes will
be evaporated immediately on the hot thimbles and will escape into the
cell., It is not considered credible that a leak will appear simultan-
eously in a cooling tube and a thimble, but if this should happen
water still could not leak into the drain tank until the temperature
of the thimble became less than 100°C.

The cooling system for the drain-tank thimbles has also been
slightly modified. Previously, in an emergency, it was planned to cool
by evaporating a small emergency reservoir and venting the steam to the
stack. In case fission-product activity was present in the normally-
closed convection cooling system, it would have been also vented to
the stack.
bl

In the revised cooling system the condensate-filled closed loop
is kept closed, and a much larger reservoir has been provided on the
closed-cooling-loop condenser. So now in an emergency in which pump
power is lost, the reservoir would drain by gravity through the cooling-
system condenser, providing cooling for about 15 hours even if no addi-
tional water were added to the reservoir. If for some reason the reser-
voir fill line were not available after 15 hours, fire hoses could be
run to provide cooling for an indefinite time.

7.1.6 Other Possibilities for Primary Container Damage

(e) Corrosion. It has been suggested that the high radiation
level in the control-rod thimbles and in the reactor cell might cause
formation of sufficient nitric acid (from the N,, O, and H,0 in the
cell) to create corrosion problems. A calculation for the most pes-
simistic conditions indicates that the concentration of nitrogen oxides
in the cell atmosphere might reach.1% in 4000 hours, the longest anti-
cipated period of continuous operation. The actual concentration
should not be this high,and HRE-2 was operated under similar conditions
without observable damage from HN03

However, it has been planned, for other reasons, to keep the oxygen

» 80 no real problem is expected.

content of the atmosphere in the containment vessel below 5% by adding
nitrogen. Oxygen-removal equipment is being considered for installation
in the cell air system to reduce the 02 content to a very low level to
eliminate potential nitric acid corrosion problems and the need for
purging with nitrogen.

7.1.8 lLast Ditch Shutdown

The possibility has been considered that there might arise a situ-
ation in which the reactor could not be emptied of fuel salt. Although
the circumstances are difficult to imagine, it is assumed that the
reactor is critical at low power and that the drain line is frozen in
spite of the design precautions which appear to make this impossible.
As a last ditch measure, LiGF - BeF, salt would be added to the pump

2
bowl through the sampler. The amount of Li6 required to poison the
o BT -

reactor to suberitical at room temperature is calculated to be only

150 grams, which would be added as approximately 2 kg of salt. The

addition of this much salt through the sampler would require several
hours, but is not a difficult means of poisoning.

If electrical power were not available to run the fuel circu-
lation pump, natural convection would continue to circulate the fuel,
it is difficult to estimate the time required for the poison to be-
come well mixed. It is assumed that a day or longer would not be ob-
jectionable.

7.2 Rupture of the Secondary Container

7.2.2 Excessive Pressure

 

As discussed in section 5.2.1 above, the test pressure of the
drain tank and the reactor cells will be 48 psig. This is less than
the maximum pressure which is now estimated to result from the worst
conceivable accident in which fuel salt and an optimum amount of water
are intimately mixed as they discharge into the cell. This accident
was considered in the "Preliminary Hazards Report," but the estimate
of loss of heat to the cell structure was overly optimistic. Two
possibilities for coping with this accident are being considered.

The first possibility is & water-spray system which would be set off

if the cell pressure should reach 20 psig for any reason. The water
supply would be provided by an elevated tank which would provide ade-
quate discharge against the maximum estimated cell pressure. If this
system is used the cell pressure could be reduced from a maximum of
about 40 psig to nearly atmospheric in about 4 hours. This means that
the leakage of fission products from the reactor cell would be limited
to a total of about 4 hours. This method of coping with the excessive
pressure is the basis for the maximum credible accident discussed under
7.3.2 below.

The other possibility which is being considered to prevent the
cell pressure from exceeding the design pressure is a pressure-suppression
system similar to that adopted for the Humbolt-Bay Reactor. The method
of controlling the excess pressure will be chosen after studies of both
systems are completed,
e e e

7.2.2 (Continued)

(a) Salt Spillage. Another consequence of salt spillage is the
possibility of the mixture of salt and water becoming critical., Suffi-
cient poison will be provided at the bottom of the containment vessel
as protection against this incident.

7.2.5 Corrosion From Salt Spillage

In an accident involving contact of water and fluoride salts in the
containment vessel, fairly rapid generation of hydrofluoric acid is ex-
pected, Part of the HF will be dispersed as vapor in the cell and part
of it will dissolve in the water. Corrosion damage resulting from dis-
solved HF is greatly dependent upon the temperature and the concentration.
Reference (1) reports corrosion penetrations ranging from 0,009 in, per
year to 0.79 in. per year with temperature ranges from 70 to 300°F and
HF concentrations from 10 to 100% by weight. Since the bottom hemi-
spherical section of the containment vessel is l-in.-thick plate, with
a protective paint coating, there is little immediate danger of cor-
rosion-caused weakening of the cell. Provision has been made for the
addition of neutralizing solution in case experiments indicate the cor-
rosion rates might damage the vessel within several months after a
spill.

7.3 Consequences of Radicactivity Release From
the Secondary Container

7.3.2 Maximum Credible Activity Release

Assumptions:
A. Quantity of fission products released from the container into
the building:

1. During operation Xe and Kr are continuously stripped so
that the quantity in the reactor system at any time (in

Alloys, The International Nickel Co., Inc,, 67 Wall St., New York 5, N. Y.
- 49 -

salt and the off-gas system) is only 25% of that produced.
This amounts to 3.75 x 10s C. The noble gases are important
only as an external radiation hazard.

2. Iodine is retained in the salt and not more than 10% can be
released. (There is some experimental basis for only 1%
release,) Of this amount, half will be retained on the con-
tainer walls, making & net release of 5% of the original
quantity into the building. The total released is 1.0 x 105 C.

3. Only 10% of solid fission products is dispersed in the ac-
cident. This amounts to 6.8 x 10° C.

4, The pressure within the container rises to 40 psig as a re-
sult of the MCA; leakage from the container is no greater
than 0,.04%/hr at this pressure. The pressure returns to at-
mospheric in 4 hours® and the leak rate decreases linearly
as the pressure returns to atmospheric. The total leakage
from the container during the 4 hours is then 0.0004 x 4 x
0.5 =8 x 10'“ of the activity dispersed in the container.
Thus, into the building is discharged the following quanti-
ties of fission products:

Quantity Escape Rate
(a) Noble gases = 300 curies 0.0208 c/sec
(b) Iodine = 80 curies 0.0055 c/sec
(¢) Solids = 536 curies 0.0372 c/sec

5. As they escape, the fission products are mixed uniformly
within the building, which has a volume of 13.6 x 10° cubic
meters, Half of the iodine is adsorbed on surfaces within
the building.

The resulting escape times for a person breathing 30 liters/
min within the high bay of this building can be calculated
for each group of activity:

*conservatively based on HRE-2 experience, Times for several MSRE
cases are being determined.

Noble Gas 25 R Ext, 45 min.

After 4 hours the concentrations reach 0,0220 C/M3 for the
noble gases, 0.0029 C/M> for the iodine and 0.039% C/M3 for
the solids. These concentrations are assumed for the gas
leaking from the high-bay liner into the building and to
the countryside.

The direct radiation dose rates which result from the
fission products in the building:

 

 

Location Dose Rate, mr/hr
Road in front (.~ 100 ft) 275
Road at side (.50 ft) 1100
HFIR (..1600 ft) 1

 

B. Release of activity from the high bay of the building:

ll'

Two paths for dispersal are available: 1) seepage from the

building through cracks and 2) discharge through filters and

the stack.

Seepage from the building should be at a rate less than

10%/day, because the building is to be lined with a con-

tinuous steel lining.

(a) For a 10%/day outleakage, neglecting decay which

would greatly reduce the noble gases, concentrations
outside the building are estimated for night-time

release (n = 0.4, ¢ 0.01), 5-MPH wind.

Iodine 3.1 0.12 0,017 24 hr
Solids 41 1.64 0.23 109 min.

 

There appears to be no great hazard in the seepage of the
fission-product mixture from the building walls under night-
time conditions. Day-time conditions result in much lower
doses. Certainly the MSRE exclusion area would have to be
evacuated, and such a release would be very likely to inter-
rupt operations at the HFIR site if the wind direction were
to the south. Based on observations of the QOak Ridge area
over a period of two years, the wind direction is SSW, S, or
SSE a total of 18.4% of the time.* With a ground-level re-
lease, it is very unlikely that the activity would be carried
over the ridge into Bethel Valley, where the main buildings of
the Oak Ridge National Laboratory are located.

At the EGCR site (two miles to the east) the concentration of
bone seekers would be 0,05 p C/M, which would require gas masks
or evacuation.

3. Discharge through the absolute filters and up the MSRE stack
at a rate of 24 Mafmin is the second possibility, if the fans
are running. This would result in less contamination to the
countryside, because the filtered discharge would consist of
little more than the noble gases and 40 curies of iodine,
amounting to a total release of only 340 curies over a period
of about 10 hr, or a rate of 0.0l c¢/sec. Under normal night-
time conditions the maximum ground concentration would occur

Oak Ridge Area, OR0-99 (Nov. 1953).

 
- 52 -

at one mile and would be only 1 p C/M, which is below the MPC
for the noble gases and the iodine,

Thus it is concluded that, in the event of the maximum credible
accident, it is preferable to continue operation of the stack
fans instead of allowing the activity to seep from the building.

7.4 Site

The distance from the MSRE to the HFIR is 1600 ft, and to the EGCR,
two miles. Figure 22A shows the relation of the MSRE to all the other
reactors in the ORNL area. Within the 0,5-mile radius circle is a popu-
lation of approximately 200 people. The population within the one-mile
circle is 4200, A 110-ft-high ridge intervenes between the MSRE and the
X-10 area, where most of the people work. The two-mile-radius circle in-
cludes only about 200 more people, As was shown in the calculation of the
maximum credible accident, there is no danger of overexposure to the pop-
ulation beyond 0.5 miles. The distribution of this personnel and the pop-
ulation of the surrounding towns and counties are shown in Tables 10, 11,
and 12,

It is noted that the MSRE site satisfies the siting requirements
as determined by the Guide Calculation presented in Appendix A of 10 CFR,
Part 100,
