FOREWORD

This quarterly progress report of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Project at ORNL
records the technical progress of the research on circulating-fuel reactors and other ANP
research ot the Laboratory under its Contract W-7405-eng-26.. The report is divided into
five major parts: 1. Aircraft Reactor Engineering, 2. Chemistry, 3. Metallurgy, 4. Heat
Transfer and Physical Properties, Radiation Damage, Fuel Recovery and Reprocessing,
and Critical Experiments, and 5. Reactor Shielding.

The ANP Project is comprised of about 550 technical and scientific personnel
engaged in many phases of research directed toward the achievement of nuclear pro-
pulsion of aircraft. A considerable portion of this research is performed in support of
the work of other organizations participating in the national ANP effort. However, the
bulk of the ANP research at ORNL is directed toward the development of o circulating-
fuel type of reactor.

The design, construction, and operation of the Aircraft Reactor Test (ART), with
the cooperation of the Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Division, are the specific objectives of
the project. The ART is to be a power plant system that will include a 60-Mw circu-
lating-fuel reflector-moderator reactor and adequate means for heat disposal. Operation
of the system will be for the purpose of determining feasibility and for studying the
problems associated with the design, construction, and operation of a high-power circu-

lating-fuel reflector-moderated aircraft reactor system.

ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

| SUMMARY

PART 1. AIRCRAFT REACTOR ENGINEERING

1.1.i Aircraft Reactor Test

Most of the detail drawings of the reactor-core,
heat-exchanger, pump, and pressure-shell assembly

have been completed, and design work on the re-

actor shield and the interior of the reactor cell is
proceeding, A review of the detail drawings indi-
cated that the pressure drop through the reflector-
moderator cooling circuit would probably be higher
than originally estimated, and therefore larger and
higher-speed motors are being ordered for the
sodiumepump drives. A re-examination is being
made of the tolerances and clecrances specified
for the fuel-to-NaK heat exchangers in an effort
to ease the fabrication problems,

Tests of a fuel pump in a high-temperature test
rig have indicated that the cavitation limit is
somewhat lower than anticipated.. However, the
increased cavitation suppression head required for
satisfactory operation can be accommodated by
increasing the fuel expansion tank pressure by

about 10 psi. In tests of a fuel pump and expansion

tank assembly no objectionable aeration or pressure
fluctuations were observed in the system over the
entire speed range when the fuel levetl in the fuel
expansion tank was varied from 1/2 to 3in.

The preliminary design of the fuel-recovery tank

was completed, The tank has been designed so

that no electrical, cooling, or other lines will need -
to be connected to it at the time it is removed from _

the cell. Lo

Studles of the reactor supporf structure were come

pleted The complete reactor and shield assembly

is to be suspended from an overhead bridge-like
structure. The weight of the reactor will be frans-

mitted to the bridge structure through the four pump

barrels. To cllow for displacement of the reactor
as a result of thermal expansion of the NaK lines, -
the lines are to be precut so that their exponsion’
will move the reactor to the desired operating posis

tion. Several bends have been added to the NaK
lines to allow for differential expansion between
the lines.

  

The stresses to be expected in the fill-ond-drain

“tank were also evaluated. The support of the fill-

and-drain tank assembly is to be accomplished by
means of a nitrogen cylinder located beneath the
tank.

A series of low-frequency thermal-cycling tests
of the core shells is under woy., The thermal
cycle being used in the tests simulates that to be
‘expected in the reactor. In the initial test the
model was subjected to 300 cycles, a factor of 10
more than expected in operation of the ART,
Visual and dimensional inspection revealed no
gross failures. Metallurgical examinations are
being made.

Additional core flow studies were made on the
full-scale model of the ART core. Heat transfer
coefficients were calculated for the 0,010-in.-thick
fuel layer odjacent to the outer and inner core
walls for the core flow pattern established by
using a swirl-type header with and without guide
vanes,

1.2, ART Physics

The results of experiments performed to determine
the rate of gamma heating in vorious target ma-
terials near the Bulk Shielding Facility (BSF)
reactor were compared with results calculated by
the method used for determining similar ART gamma
heating rates. The good agreement between the
experimental ond the calculated heat generation

~ values for samples near the BSF indicates that the
“basic gamma-ray data and the Prott & Whitney

gamma-ray deposition code used for the ART cal-
culations should give representative results for
the gomma-ray heat- deposihon in various parts of

the ART,

- Two-dimensional gamma-ray hecfmg calculations

' for the ART have been performed by using a code

developed for the IBM-704 computer by Kneidler
and Wenzel ot Pratt & Whitney. Source strengths

~ for - the calculations were obtained -from two-

dimensional multigroup neutron calculations and
from critical experiments. The total gamma-ray
deposition (excluding that caused by sources in the
heat exchanger region) in the reactor was found to

 
 

 

 

ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

be 3.86 Mw, which amounts to approximately 84%

of the total source. This means that about 16% of
the gamma-ray source energy escapes.

1.3, ART Instruments and Controls

The ART simulator was used for a study of tem-
perature control of the reflector-moderator and the
temperature responses of the reflector-moderator
cooling system. A control system was evolved
which will hold the mean reflector-moderator tem-
perature constant to within +15°F for step changes
between zero, 50, and 100% design power and be-
tween 1200 and 1425°F mecan fuel temperature (of
50% and zero power).

Tests were continved on a helwm-bubbler type
of level indicator for the fuel expansion tank, and
three test systems are being constructed for study-
ing other liquid-level-sensing devices under con-
trolled conditions in flowing liquids. Additional

tests of a high-temperature turbine type of flow- -

meter have indicated that these units can be ex-
pected to operate satisfactorily at 1500°F for
3000 hr. A unit with a 3‘/2-in.-dia housing for oper-
ation in o system with flow rates up to 1400 gpm
is being fabricated,

Evaluation tests of several types of high-
temperature pressure transmitters were continuved.
The effects of out-of-pile aging on the calibration
of thermocouples are being studied, and plans are
being made for in-pile tests, Life tests of two
synchronized high-speed mercury-jet switches for
scanning thermocouple signals are under way.

1.4, Component Development and T_esiiﬁg

Evaluation studies of lubricating and cooling

fluids for pumps were continued. Tests are being

made in order to determine the compatibility of
various lubricants and reactor process fluids and to

evaluate elastomers for seal application.

Preliminary test data were obtained which indi-
cated that fission-gas leakage from the sumps of
the ART fuel pumps would be attenuated by a
factor of at least 104 from the expansion tank to
the shaft seal and by another factor of at least
104 between the seal and the iubricating oil
reservoir, . These data are being analyzed to de-
termine the radiation dose to be expected at the
oil reservoirs,

Developmental test worl: on the. fuel pump im-
peller continued. Modifications were made to the
slinger impeller and to the seal plate over the

centrifuge cup to improve performance. An en-
durance test of a fuel pump was terminated after
approximately 2000 hr of satisfactory operation.
The pump was disassembled, examined, and re-
assembled for further high-temperature testing.
More than 400 additional hours of satisfactory

operation had been accumulated by the end. of the

report period.
Water testing of on ART sodlum pump continued,

Various configurations of the flow passages above

the centrifuge were tested, and a configuration was
found which gave stable operation of the pump in
a performance-acceptance loop.

Water tests were also performed .on lnconel ports
for the NaK pumps. Data for the Inconel parts
were found to be satisfactory when compared with
data obtained previously with a brass impeller.

York NaK-to-air radiator No. 9, the first 500-kw
radiator of the revised design to be tested, was
found to be in satisfactory condition after comple-
tion of a program of 30 thermal cycles.. Endurance
testing of a heat exchanger at ART fuel-to-NaK
heat exchanger design temperature and flow condi-
tions with a heat load of 400 kw was initiated,

Two 4-in.~dia circulating cold traps equipped with
stainless steel cooling coils were placed in opera-
tion with no difficulties from oxide plugging. A
procedure for startup of the ART cold traps was
developed.

Water tests of the aluminum mockup of the ART
fuel system components of the north head were
continved.  Fabrication of a second aluminum
north head is under way in which the sodium sys-
tem components will be mocked up.

Four ART prototype dump valves received from
vendors were fested, but none met performance
specifications for ART operation. Assembly and
and welding procedures ore being analyzed, and
seat materials are being tested in fused salts.

Apparatus and techniques are being developed
for investigating the effect of high-frequency
thermal oscillations and the resultant thermal
fatigue stresses on the ART core. A high-frequency
pulse pump has been demgned for dynamic mixing
of hot and cold fluids to provide a thermal-oscilla-
tion frequency range of 1 to 10 cps and a surface
amplitude of about 100°F.

Various types of cold traps and pluggmg mdn-
cators are being evaluated in test stands. The
test stands are also equipped with Argonne samplers
and Mine Safety Appliances samplers -so that

-}

)

chemical analyses of the NaK being circulated
can be used to calibrate the plugging indicators,

Liquid-metal-vapor condensers are being - de-
veloped for use in helium purge systems in the

ART sodium and NaK circuits and the NaK dump -

tanks, High~temperature chemical absorbents and
thermal-precipitation traps arte being investigated
in the development of a zirconium fluoride vapor

. trap. - The most promising system consists of a
. bed of hot alumina which reacts with gaseous
- ZrF  to form solid ZrO, and AlF,,

1.5, Procurement and Constructren

Work on the building aodditions, building altera-

tions, and cell instaliation for the ART has been -

completed, except for installation of six circvit
breakers and the completion of modifications to the

~ cell floor structure. A rigid leak test of the re-

actor cell was made; a zero leakage rate was ob-
tained with a detector sensitive to 5 micron 3 /hr.,
Since the contract specification allowed 32 micron

" #3/hr, the wvessel satisfactorily met the leak

tightness requirement. The installation of aquxiliary
services piping was completed, except for re-
placement of 15 incorrect valves in- the nitrogen
system, The electrical control centers and the
spectrometer room electrical and air-conditioning
equipment were completed. Work on the diesel
generators was delayed because one of the gen-
erators and three control panels were damaged in
shipment. - Two ‘of the four main blowers were
installed, -
Program and design planning for d:sossembly of

the ART were initiated. Procedures and tools

necessary for removing the reactor are’ belng de-
veloped, and. a new, Iarge hot-cell facnllty is bemg

~planned.. -
s Constructlon work started on the Engineermg

Test  Unit (ETU) facility, Details of the main

"NaK piping were determined and the design of the
air duct for the NaK-ts-air radiators was prepared.’
~The. study of the reactor assembly problem was

continued, -and genera! assembly procedures were

,prepured. ‘Nearly .all the components and spare

parts . needed for three reactors have been ordered.

) '_Fabncotion of the north head for the ETU reactor
‘is 40% complete._ The lower half of the beryllium
reflector-moderator has been contouted, und dnllmg'

of the coolant holes was started.
The York Corp, ond Black, Sivalls & Bryson,
Inc., are developing techniques for fabricating

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1956

the fuel-to-NaK heat exchangers, The sodium-to-
NaK ' heat exchangers are being fabricated and
should be available soon. -The Hydrospin machine
has been enlarged to produce the various shells
required for the reactors, and the outer core shells
for the ETU are being fabricated. '
Acceptable samples of finished boron carbide
tiles were received from the Norfon Company. An

‘order has been placed for forgings for the reactor

1.6. In-Pile Loop Development and Tests
Examination of in-pile loop No. 5, which was
inserted in the MTR but could not be filled with

fuel, revealed that a plug had formed in the fill
line that was a mixture of fuel and zirconium oxide.

~ Inepile loop No. 6, which is to be inserted in the

MTR soon, is to operate at a maximum loop tem-
perature of 1600°F with the fuel mixture NaF-ZrF ,-

(53.5-40-6.5 mole %), o 300°F temperature
differential across the nose coil, and a power
density of about 0.75 kw/cm3, A horizontal-shaft

sump pump, identical to that in in-pile loop No. 6,

is operating satisfactorily in o test loop. It will
have accumulated 1150 hr of operation by the time
in-pile loop No. 6 is inserted in the MTR,

1.7. Advanced Reactor Design

" Reactor designs are being investigated in which
the fuel cools the moderator, in order to eliminate
the sodium circuit used for cooling the moderator
in reactors of the ART type. One of these designs
depends on moderation by beryllium oxide in the
reflector and some additional moderation by graphite
in the core.’ Thermal stresses dictate the use of
the - graphite in the core.  The relatively poor
moderating properties of graphite are not too ob-

~ jectionable ‘becouse of the relatively large core

size (24 in. in digmeter) required by the total
power and the allowable power densities. On the
other hand, the use of a very good moderatfor, such
as zirconium or yHrium hydride, in the core would
make the reactor independent of moderation by the
reflector, and metals could be used in the reflector.
Metals require few cooling holes and are good
gammastay and fast-neutron shields, With presently
assumed materials properties, the hydride-moderated
reactors would be better than the graphite~beryllium
oxide moderated reactors; on the other hand, the
properties of graphite and beryllium oxide are
somewhat better known.

PART 2. CHEMISTRY
2.1, Phase Equilibrium Studies

Phase equilibrium studies of fuel system com=

ponents were continved. A re-examination of the
LiF-RbF system has revealed the compound
LiF-RbF, and a revised equilibrium diagram has
been prepared. Further examination of the LiF-UF,
system has confirmed the identity of the previously
arbitrarily designated compound 3LiF:UF,. There
is evidence that the compound is metastable.

Studies of the RbF-UF 4 System progressed suf-
ficiently for a tentative equilibrium diagram to be
prepared. The boundary curves, compatibility
triangles, peritectic temperatures, and eutectic
temperatures for the NaF-RbF-UF , ternary system
are now well-established. Detailed examination of
the four-component system NaF-RbF-ZrF 4-UF 4 has
established several mixtures which are of possnble
interest as reactor fuels. '

In studies of the RbF-CaF, system it has not
been possible to get reproducible data for compo-
sitions . containing more than 15 mole % CaF..
There is evidence of a compound with a cubic
structure, which is presumed to be RbF-Con
Examinations of the systems LiF-CeF,, NaF-CeF,,
and RbF.CeF 3 were continued, but, as yet, 1here
is insufficient data for the preparation of equilibrium
diagrams. The NaF-CeF, system was shown to
have a binary eutectic, whlch melts at 775 1 10°C,

A study of the CsF-BeF, system was started
in order to complete the study of the alkali fluoride—
beryllium fluoride systems. This study is incom-
plete, but, as in other alkali fluoride~beryllium
fluoride systems, liquidus temperatures diminish
rapidly in this system with increasing BeF, con-
tent in the 33'6 to 50 mole % BeF , region.

Study of the NaF-LiF-BeF, system progressed
sufficiently for a plot of the boundary curves, com-
patibility triangles, and pertinent temperatures to
be prepared, although the composition of one of the
ternary compounds is not completely established.
The ternary system NaF-RbF-BeF, requires addi-
tional study before the analogous diagram con be
constructed.

Lowemelting chloride systems, which are poten-
t_nolly useful as heat transfer mediums, are being
investigated.  The present investigation of the
KCI-ZrF, system covers the composition range of
10 to 75 mole % ZrF,. It will be of interest to
compare phase equnl:brwm behavior in these

MCI-ZrCl, systems with behavior in the analogous
MF-ZrF systems, which have been thoroughly
stuched ot ORNL. :

22. Chemical Reocﬂons in Molien Salts -

: lnveshgatlon of the equnllbrlum reduction of
NlF by H, in NaF-ZrF , was continued. A related
mveshgohon of the stobzllty of NiF, in the solvent
was made that indicated the essential validity of
the equilibration data which have been obtained at
500, 575, and 625°C. The data obtained to _dofe
indicate that the activity coefficient for NiF,
NaF-ZrF, (53-47 mole %) must be about 2750 ot
600°C, The _corresponding value for FeF, in this
solvent was previously found to be 3_28 In the
investigation of the stability of NiF, in the solvent,
a number of peculiar effects were observed that
appear to be important in mechanisms of cotrosion
of nickel by molten salts. Additional study of
these phenomena is to be undertaken,

The study of the activity of chromium in chromium-
nickel alloys was completed, and the values ob-
tained at 750 and 965°C are presented. The
studies of the solubility and stability of the
structural metal fluorides in fluoride mixtures
were extended to include CrF » FeF,, and NiF,
the solvents LiF-ZrF, (52-48 mole %), NoF-ZrF
(59-41 mole %), and KF—ZrF (52-48 mole %). In
addition, the solubility of CrF in the NeF-LiF-KF
eutectic was determined. The solubility of CrF,
in these solvents voried markedly with the solvent
used. In all tests with FeF, at 600°C the solu-
bility increased with excess Eer present and the
zirconium-to-sodium ratios tended to decrease with
increasing excess FeF,, ‘The solubility of NiF,
in NaF-ZrF, and KF-ZrF, was found to be the
same and nearly independent of the amount of NiF
added. However, the solubility in LiF-ZrF, is a
function of the amount of NiF, added at both 600
and 800°C, :

Studies of the reducﬂon of UF by structural
metals were extended to include the reaction media
RbF-ZrF, (60-40 mole %) and L|FQBeF (48-52
mole %). The equilibrium chromium concentrahons
in the RbF-ZrF, mixture at 800°C were found to
be lower than those in any other alkali fluoride—
ZrF, mixture studied, The equilibrium iron con-
centrohons were found to be virtually independent

‘of the reaction medium and in cll cases were

higher at 600 than ot 800°C. This behavior is in
marked contrast to that observed for the Cr -UF

system, which exhibits strong dependence on the
reaction medium,

The solubilities of the structural metal ﬂuor:des
NiF,, FeF,, and CGrF, in molten NaF-ZrF, (53-47
mole %) that were determined by using concentra-
tion cells and an emf method are presented. The
results fall within the range of the results obtamed
by filtration,

- Vapor pressure data were used fo calculute the

| effects of concentration and temperature on activi-

ties in the RbF-ZrF and KF-ZrF, systems.
Activities of KF were very slightly hlgher than the
activities of RbF ot correspondmg compositions
and temperatures, since the larger rubidium ion
has less affinity for the fluoride and RbF is g
better complexmg ‘agent than KF., The ZeF,
activity was found to decrease with mcreasmg

~ ionic radius of the alkali cation.

A systematic invesfigation of the solubilities of
rare-earth fluorides in ART-type fuels was initiated,
In the initial studies, LaF, and CeF, were used in
the solvents NaF-KF-LiF (11.5-42-46.5 mole %)}

and NaF-ZrF (50-50 mole %). The results obtained

thus for show the solubilities to be comfortably
high from the standpoint of reactor operation.

. Apparatus is being assembled for the determination

of the solubility of xenon in fused salts, -
Polarography was utilized for quantitative analy-
ses of structural metal jons in the NaF-KF<LiF
eutectic. Half-wave potentials were identified for
Ni*t Fe***, and Cr**?, and solubility determina-
tions were made by following the plot of wave

2.3. Physical Properties of Molten Materials

Difficulties caused by partial plugging of the
capillary tips in the apparatus for applying the
maximum bubble-pressure method to determinations
of surface tensions of NaF-ZrF, mixtures have
prevented the accumulation of accurate data. The
equipment is belng modified to minimize contamina-
tion,

Density determinations were made on NaF.ZrF,

 (53-47 mole %) ot 600, 700, and 800°C, The values

presented are believed to be accurate to within 2%,

The sessile-drop technique was used for addi-
tional measurements of surface tensions of NaF-.
ZrF, (53-47 mole %) mixtures. . Experiments de-
signed to study the effects on surface tension of
change of composition as a function of temperature,

- pressure of the confining gas, and time of equili-

bration are under way. Experiments are also under
way to determine the wetting properties and surface
tensions of UF, and of UF, with small additions
of UO, on graphite.

_ 274. Production of Purified Fluoride Mixtures

The use of copper-lined stainless steel reactor
vessels has proved to be successful in all but one
instance. It has been found that if NaF-KF-LiF-
UF, mixtures are frozen in the copper-lined vessels,
the copper liner will rupture when the mixture is
remelted. Therefore any large-scale production of
such mixtures would require continuous operation
of the production facility so that the mixture could
be maintained molten at all times.

- - A dust filter is being installed so that the con-
- version of about 2000 Ib of :low-hafnium ZrCl, to
ZrF, can be started. It is hoped that the filter
~will prevent Iurge-scale loss of the product during
" the conversion and permit efficient- -operation,

2.5. Compatibility of Materials at
High Temperatures -

The diffusion of uranium fluoride~containing
mixtures into graphite was studied by obtaining

counts, with an alpha counter, en samples ob-

tained by filing and scraping, in a uniform manner,
the surfaces of the graphite specimens, . After 10 hr
of exposure to NaF-ZrF ‘-UF 4 (53.5-40-6.5 mole %)
at 600°C, there was no evidence of penetration,
and, after 50 and 250 hr, only slight increases in
alpha count were found. A graphite sample ex-
posed at 800°C, however, showed a sufficient
increase in the alpha coynt after 10 hr of exposure
to indicate the presence of the salt |n5:de the
test spec:men.

. An apparatus was developed for measuring the
equilibrium pressure of hydrogen from the reaction
of NaOH and nickel, The new apparatus permits
measurements . of the pressure inside a sealed
quartz envelope containing the NaOH-Ni. system.
The measurements can be made after the apparatus
has cocled to rcom temperature. Results of pre-
liminary experiments are presented,

Equipment has been assembled for testing
elastomers under tension in NaK at 185 to 190°C,
Screening tests are under way.

In the search for a reliable and practical method
for analyzing for oxygen in NaK, a comparison was
made of the amalgam and the butyl bromide methods.
The values obtained by the two methods disagreed
radically, and therefore further studies of these
methods cre under way.

2.6. Analytical Chemistry

Tiron (disodium-1,2-dihydroxybenzene-3,5-disul-
fonate) was applied to the spectrophotometric de-
termination of cerium in NaF-KF-LiF-UF, and
NaF-ZrF -UF ,. A colored complex, with its ab-
sorption ' maximum at 500 my, results from the
redaction between cerium and Tiron in a slightly
basic solution.  Uranium, zirconium, iron, and
fluoride interfere; however, their interference is
readily . eliminated by various means, including
extraction.  Sodium alizarin sulfonate is being
investigated os a possible reagent for the spec-
trophotometric determination of lanthanum in
fluoride salt mixtures. '

The minimum concentration of tantalum that can
be determined by the tannin-pyrogallol method in
NaF-ZrF «UF, was found to be approximately
1000 pg. | '

The buffering action, which was observed when
the aqueous solution from the dissolution of NaK
in butyl bromide was titrated with acid, was found

" to be attributable to the presence of 7 to 20 ppm

of aluminum in the alloy. Although these small
concentrations will produce buffering, they cannot
account for the high oxide concentrations that
have been found in NaK by the butyl bromide

method. A modified metal reactor was constructed

so that the amalgamation procedure for the de-

termination of oxygen in NaK can be used.

An apparatus for sumplmg alkali metals at hlgh
temperatute was modified by substituting a glass-
tosmetal Wilson seal for a packing gland seal to
facilitate complete removal of oxygen from the
apparatus and by replacing the Teflon-packed gate
valve with a Teflon-packed Jamesbury valve. This
valve is a reliable, vacuum-tight, ball-type valve,
which is completely opened or closed by a one-
quarter turn of the handle,

Methods for the determination of oxygen, carbon,
and nitrogen in lithium were studied. The last
two elements were analyzed by dissolving the
sample in water fo convert nitrides and carbides to
emmonia and acetylene, respectively, which were
then determined by conventional methods,

An all-metallic apparatus for the determmahon of
oxygen in lithium by amolgamation was constructed
which will facilitate transfer of samples without
atmospheric contamination. A modification of the
butyl bromide method for oxygen was studied for
application to lithium. The metal is dissolved in
an ethereal solution of n<buty| iodide in the presence
of iodine. |t is postulated that the lithium forms
the neutral iodide salt, that lithium carbide and
nitride are oxidized, and that the oxide remains
unchanged by the dissolution of the metal,

The experimental investigation of means for the
introduction of reproducible concentrations of
sodium into air was continved with limited success,
Stable aerosols were not formed when helium which
had been equilibrated with 20 to 100 ug of sodium
per liter of gas was mixed with 10 times its volume
of air. Therefore, a test facility, which is essen-
tially a mockup of the ART radiators, is being
fabricated to test the instruments which have
been developed for the detecﬂon of traces of NaK
in air,

A device was constructed which will permit
visual observation of compatibility tests of molten

mixture for 3000 hr with maximum and minimum

.was to a depth of 14 mils, and no deposits were

found in the cold zones that could be attributed to

_mass transfer.

It was found that i mcreasmg ‘the temperafure drop

from 300 to 400°F in Inconel loops circulating
. sodl_um at the same maximum fluid temperature
_appreciably increased the amount of mass transfer,

The mass transfer was also appreciably increased
by increasing the maximum fluid temperature from

1350 to 1500°F. For type 316 stainless steel

loops circulating sodium, the effect of increasing

the maximum fluid temperatures from 1500 to 1650°F

~ was  slight. A type 310 stainless steel loop

3.2. Genercl Corrosion Studies

The recrystallized portion of resistance-welded
Inconel . tube-to-header joints fabricated by the
**flange-during-welding method’’
The Glenn L. Martin Co. was found to have gocd
corrosion resistance to NaF-ZrF UF, (50-46-4
mole %) and to NaK {56-44 wt %) ot 1500°F dwing
a 100«hr test, The maximum attack on the joints
tested in NoK was 0.5 mil, and those tested in the
fuel showed 1.5 mil of attack on the header portion
and less than 0.5 mil of attack on the recrystallized
portion of the worked tube,

Seesaw corrosion tests of Coast Metals brazing
alloy No. 53 (81% Ni~8% Cr—4% B—-4% Si-3% Fe)
in NaF-ZrF -UF  (53.5-40-6.5 mole %) and in NaK
(56-44 wt %) showed the same type of boron deple-
tion as that found previcusly with Coast Metals
brazing alloy No. 52. Boron was depleted from
the specimen tested in NaK for 100 hr at 1500°F
to a depth of 2.5 mils and from the specimen tested
in the fuel mixture to a depth of 1.5 mils,

Haynes brazing alloy No. 40 (nominal compo-
sition, in wt %: Cr, 13.5; Fe, 4.5; Si, 3.9; B, 3.2;
Co, 1.0; C, 0.42; Mn, 0.25; Ni, balance) showed
good corrosion resistance to NaK (56-44 wt %) but
only fair resistance (3 mils of heavy attack) to
NaF-ZrF ,-UF (50-46~4 mole %) during 100-hr
tests at 1500"1:

No mass transfer and very little corrosion occurred
in tests of niobium in sodium and in lithium in

seesaw apparatus. In these tests for 100-hr periods -

the hot-zone temperature was 1535°F and the cold-
zone temperature was 995°F.

Long-duration tests of static NaF-ZrF -UF,
(56-40-4 mole %) in Inconel in which temperature
gradient was used to make the more volatile ZrF
crystallize above the fused-salt bath revealed that
no attack occurred in the vapor zone and that the

and supplied by

attack- in the bath region was less than' that nor-

~ mally observed in fused-salt Inconel tests.

Of the four alloys subjected to carburization by

‘exposure for 100 hr ot 1500°F to static sodium

containing various amounts of added graphite, the
alloys that experienced the greatest amount of
carbon pickup were, in descending order, type 430
stainless steel, type 316 stdainless steel, type 310
stainless steel, and Hastelloy B. The alloys that
suffered the greatest amount of carbon penetration
were, in descending order, type 430 stainless steel,
type 316 stainless steel, Hastelloy B and type

- 310 stainless steel.

It was demonsirated that chromiume-plating Inconel
specimens prior to testing them in contact with
beryllium while immersed in sodium at 1300°F was
effective in reducing the extent of alloying. A
minimum of 5 mils of chromium plate will be neces-
sary to ensure that all the chromium is not con-
sumed by an alloying reaction with beryllium,

Two Inconel thermal-convection loops were
operated ‘with sodium in fests conducted to de-
termine the effect of a diffusion cold trap on the
amount of mass transfer into the cold leg of the
loop. Corrosion and mass transfer were found to be
less in the loop with the diffusion cold trap than
in a standard loop with no trap.

Seventeen thermal-convection loops constructed
of various grades of the stainless steels ond
Inconel were operated with lithium. None of the
stainless steels had satisfactory resistance to
mass transfer at hot-zone temperatures of 1500°F
and Inconel was not satlsfactory at a temperature
of 1300°F.

- The intermetallic compounds NiAi NiAl + 5% Ni,
NiAl + 4% Zr, and MoAl were corrosion tested in
static sodium and in NaF.ZrF +UF, (53.5-40-6.5
mole %) for 100 hr at 1500°F The compounds
were not attacked by the sodium, but they were
severely attacked by the fused sait.- '

"Encouraging results were obtained in the fobrl-
cation of tubular contrel rods by co-extrusion, The

Simulated fuel element tubing redrawn from three-

~ ply tube blanks extruded previously was received

oxide particles in the core, The study of fiow
patterns in three-ply extrusions was continued,
with the effects of sectional cores and cores with
tapered ends being investigated, A 29-deg taper
in the ends of the core reduced the lengths of the

has been built in which a production rate of 8000
rings per hour has been attained. [t is felt that
production of this magnitude will definitely estab-
lish a satisfactory cost for ring production,

Experiments were conducted to determine the
most satisfactory method for preplacing an adequate
supply of braze metal at each joint in the assembly
of multitube heat exchangers, The most successful
method of initiating capillary flow was found to be
the metalespray primer technique.

Hardness values were determined for cold-rolled
Hastelloy B sheet after aging freatments for various
times at 1200°F., A microstructure correlation is
being made to study the effect of aging on the
physical properties of Hastelloy B.

3.5, Mei:ﬁnnicnl Properties Studies

" Equipment has been designed and constructed
with which it is possible to determine the relaxa-
tion behavior of metals at high temperatures. Infor-
mation of this type is required in order to analyze
the -residual plastic strain induced by cyclic
thermal stresses. Data on the reloxation charac-
teristics of Inconel at 1300 and 1500°F are pre-
sented,

Tests were run to determine the effect of the
fuel mixture NaF-ZrF +UF (50-46-4 mole %) on
the creep strength of Hastelloy X. The results in-
dicate that Hastelioy X is subject to such severe
corrosive attack by the fuel that o drastic reduc-
tion of its creep strength occurs at temperatures
above 1500°F,

Creep-rupture testing of an 80% Mg-20% L.i ailoy
at 200°F is under way. The data obtained to date
are presented in the form of design curves, with
stress as the ordinate and times to various elonga-
tions and rupture as the abscissa,

3.6. ‘Ceramic Research

A study of the fabrication and physical properties
of europium oxide was initiated, Numerous shapes
of nickel—trare earth oxide cermets, Al O, and
CaF, were produced for use in a high-temperature
critical experiment. Test pieces were produced
of high-density, high-purity beryllium oxide and of
zirconium carbide, . A hydriding furnace is being
built for producing zirconium end yttrium hydrides.
A die is being designed for fabricating a l/4-in.-OD
beryllium oxide rod with five longitudinal holes.

A high-temperature x-ray diffraction study of
Hastelloy B ot 500, 600, and 700°C showed only

10

a slight shift to larger d values with increasing
temperature. No inversions were found, and a
face-centered cubic pattern was obtamed at all
temperatures, ' o

7. Nondesﬁucfiv_e Testing Sfudié_s,

* Much time was devoted during the quarter to the

routine inspection of approximately 17,000 ft of -

pipe and tubing for the reactor construction pro-
gram, Both encircling-coil eddy-current and
immersed-ultrasound methods of inspection were
used. Metallographic examinations were made of
regions that showed defects in order to correlate
the defect types and sizes with the data presenfed
by the inspection instruments. .

An inspection method for the . detection of small
laminar defects in sheet material was developed.
After consideration and rejection of such tech-
niques as ultrasonic resonance, conventional

pulse-echo vltrasound, and tfransmission attenua- -
tion of ultrasound by using transducers on opposite
sides of the sheet, a new vultrasonic method was

conceived and is presently being investigated.
This method requires a pulse of ultrasound of 5 to
20 psec duration tuned to such a frequency that
the sheet thickness is an exact multiple of the
half wavelength, Under these conditions a rever-
beration, or ringing, of the ultrasound between
the two sheet surfaces is obtained, and the presence
of laminations is detected by a decrease in the
ringing. The reflectoscope is being modified for
application to this sheet inspection technique,

3.8. Inspection of Materials and Components

Inspection of 3183 critical welds resulted in an
11% rejection rate for porosity, cracks, misalign-

ment, lack of fusion, and lack of penetration.
Inspections by radiographic, dye-penetrant, ultra-

sonic, and visual techniques were completed on
over 13,000 ft of tubing, and various emounts of
pipe,. plate, sheet, rod, and other Inconel material
were inspected. The rejection rate for pipe and
tubing has averaged approximately 10%, except
for two lots which were completely rejected, one
for oxidation of the inner surface and the other for
defects. Rejection rates for other shapes were not
greater than 5% and averaged much less.

Sixty feet of Inconel W and 208 ft. of Hastelloy . B ”

tubing were also inspected. The Inconel W tubing

was found to be acceptable, but over 65% of the

Hastelloy B tubing was rejected. However, be-
cause of the immediate need for the Hastelloy B

Dlsassembly and examination of MTR in-pile
Ioop No. 3 has been completed, except for metal-

lographic examination of the pump impeller. Cor-

rosion of the nose coil varied from 1 mil near the
mlet to @ maximum of 3 mils near the outlet. No
mass-transferred crystalllne deposits were found.

- Diassembly of in-pile loop No. 4 has been started,

but as yet no results are available. In-pile loop
No. 5, which was inserted in the MTR but could

not be filled, was received for disassembly, Ex-
amination of the fill line revealed the probable

location of the plug which prevented filling. Fuel

ANP PROJECT PkOGRESS REPORT

ART NaK-to-air radiators has been obtained for
further burst tests in helium and in fuel mixtures.

Irradiation of static corrosion capsules in the
MTR has been continued, Two Inconel capsules
containing the fuel mixture NaF.-ZrF -UF, (53.5-
40-6.5 mole %) were irradiated ot 6 kw/cm3 for
over nine weeks. One capsule released fission-
product ‘activity after a temperature excursion re-
sulting from the failure of a thermocouple, but
contemination control by freezing the fuel made it

unnecessary to interrupt MTR operation. Two-

other capsules are being irradiated at 6 kw /m3,
Five Inconel capsules have been opened, ond
samples have been submitted for chemical analysis
and metallographic examination. Hastelloy B
capsules have been filled with the fuel mixture
NaF-KF-LiF-UF and are being prepared for bench
tests and MTR irradiations.

‘A series of charcoal traps of different geometries
but with the same amount of charcoal are being
tested in radiokrypton holdup experiments. The
results of the tests will provide information needed
for the evaluation of the effects of the shape of the
trap on the holdup efficiency.

The cause of failure of the pump in the LITR
vertical in-pile loop was found to be o loose shear
pin which lodged in the impeller, threw it out of
balance, and bent the shaft until it rubbed against
the impeller housing. [n the future, internal loop
parts are to be joined by welding. Thermal mockup
and bearing tests have been run on a modified
shaft which is shorter and stiffer and which has
improved bearings, Pump performance tests were
run with water to optimize impeller clearances, and
the results were interpreted in terms of fuel
Reynolds number in a loop with the optimized
pump. A full-scale bench-test pump is being as-
sembled, and in-pile loop parts are being modified
to conform with the improved pump design.

A new electronic analog circuit has been de-
veloped for simulation of the thermal behavior of
the LITR vertical in-pile loop. A series of calcu-
letions has been made which illustrates the be-
havior of the loop when circulating the fuel mixture
NaF-ZrF ,-UF , (63-25-12-mole %) in position C-46
of the LITR. -

Electronic analog simulation was used to inves-
tigate the possibility that fluctuations in the
efficiency of removal of xenon from the fuel by the
pumps might cause troublesome reactivity tran-
sients in the ART. It was found that no transient

12

exists which has a period that is short enough to

cause concern for the controllability of the ART.

The fission yield of 65-day Zr?5 was determined
in enriched U,04 and in the fuel mixture (No. 44)
NaF-ZrF ,-UF (53.5-40-6.5 mole %). For use in
fission momtormg, the yield found for Ze95 s
0.0664 +0.0013 atom/fission.

Characteristic curves have been obtained for a
Philco surface-barrier transistor before and after a
series of “irradiations in hole 5IN of the ORNL
Graphite Reactor. Although the coflector charac-
teristic showed considerable change, the grounded-
base characteristic. family of curves remained
practically unchanged after irradiation to an inte-
grated dose of about 1072 nvt,, A model is pro-
posed to explain why transistors of different con-
struction show various sensmvmes to surfoce
conditions,

Metallographic examination of a scmple of stain-~

less-steel-clad CaB _ .Fe that had been irradiated
in the LITR showeg that the clad-core interface
had retained its continuity.” There was on evidence
of gross cracking in the core or of deformation of
the specimen. Additional somples are being irra-
diated. Irradiation tests were started in the LITR
on stainless-steel-clad boron nitride~nickel cermet
specimens at room temperature -and at 1600°F.
Experimental equipment was developed and shipped
to the MTR for the irradiation of neutron shield
materials at elevated temperatures. The first
material to be tested will be a stainlessisteel-clad
copper—boron carbide cermet. The temperature of
irradiation will be 1600°F. Boron nitride powder
samples were obtained and analyzed, and irradic-
tions of pressed bodies of this materna[ are
planned.

Creep and compression tests on copper—boron
carbide compacts have been [made at - elevated
temperatures.  High-temperature deformation was
found to strengthen the material. = Equipment for
testing stressed material during |rrad|ahon in the

was designed which allows the tempercture of the
piping to be above 525°C while the temperature of
the connector to the copper cable is below 85°C.
In order to maintain the electrical -insulating gus-

kets in the freeze valve vent lines at or below

140°C, copper cooling fins were installed on the
vent lines, A molten-salt sampler was tested and
found to be satisfactory for pilot plant use,

‘The decomposition of the complex UF ¢*3NaF to
a nonvolatile product was studied over the temper-

ature range 245 to 355°C in order to evaluate the
effect of the decomposition on operation of the NaF

absorption-desorption step of the volatility process.

- At temperatures above 250°C the decomposition

rate was of sufficient magnitude to seriously in-

 crease the uranium retention on the NaF bed if the

temperature and sweep gas.flow rate specified by
the process flowsheet were not precnsely con-
trolled.

Data obtained on the temperature dependence of

where r is the decomposition rate and T the abso-

lute temperature. The activation energy for the

the ART high-temperature critical assembly which

. PART 5. REACTQ‘R SHIELD‘NG
5.1, Shielding Theory

The results of calculations of gamma-ray energy
flux, dose rate, and buildup factors in a lead-water
shield of finite thickness are presented. A Monte
Carlo method was used for the calculations, which
included 1., 3+, and 6-Mev photons incident along a
normal ond at on angle of 60 deg. Comparisons
are made with data from the results of the moments-
method solution and from an earlier Monte Carlo
calculation for 3-Mev photons normally incident
upon a one-region finite lead shield.

The results of the calculations for radiation
incident at 60 deg indicate that the practice of
using only normal incidence data for shield designs
can lead to a poor approximation. This problem
becomes most acute when the number of mean free
paths across the shield is small or when the angular
distribution is such that a large portion of the
radiation is not normal or nearly normal to the
slab. _
5.2. Lid Tank Shielding Focility

The ‘,;tudies of udvcmced shielding materials
were continued with mockups consisting of a beryl-

- livm moderator region, a lead or depleted~uranium
‘gamma-ay shield, and a lithium hydride and oil
~ neutron shield. In some mockups a boral sheet was

inserted outside the beryllium layer to prevent
thermal neutrens from ‘entering - the gamma-ray
shield material. :

Data obtained thus for indicate a strong influence
of the placement of the various materials on.the
gamma-ray dose rate, The thermal-neutron traverses
for the various configurations, however, show the
flux to be independent of the order of the lithium
hydride and lead, except for the difference at the
beginning of each traverse caused by variations
in the amount of oil trapped between the various

13

 
 

 

 

slabs. For a similar crrangement containing de-

depleted uranium, moving the uranium out of the.

intense neutron field redyced the thermal-neutron
flux. The results of fast-neutron dose rate traverses
are being analyzed, and studies of similar cone
figurations are being continued,

53, Bulk Shielding Facility
The gamma-ray energy spectrum and time decay
characteristics of the fission products of U235
as related to circulating-fuel reactors are being
investigated, Based on the preliminary energy-
spectrum dota obtained thus far, an integration of

the spectra between 0.28 and 5.0 Mev and between
1.25 ond 1600 sec gave a total of 2.81 photons

emitted per fission with a total energy of 3.22 Mev .
. per fission, These values are to be compured with

data obtained from experiments on time decay
characteristics which gave 2,92 photons per
fission and 3.23 Mev per fission, All these values
carry an estimated error of about $25%.
Experiments are under way in an investigation of
the effect on the dose rate outside the ART lead

filled pipes. Measurements made beyond a duct

ments made beyond straight-through penetrations

being studied. Measurements are now being made
in order to determine the effects of various com-
ponents in the mockups and of adding patches to
the shietding, o L

STATUS OF ART DESIGN
Reactor Assembly

Most of the detail drawings of the reactor-core,

heat-exchanger, pump, and pressure-shell assembly -

have been completed, and the drawings have been

‘approved for procurement. Design work on the

reactor shield and the cell interior is proceeding
concurrenfly with the construction of a one-half-
scale model of the reactor- pressure-shell, NaK-

~ manifold, and lead-shield assembly, and a one-

sixth-scale model of the reactor and cell, These
models are proving most helpful in visualizing
interference problems in both assembly and in

cedures for assembly, operation, and servicing is

- continuing, with major attention being given to

vnusual contingencies.

Reflector-Moderator Cooling Circyit

A careful review of the detail drawings indicated
that the pressure drop through the reflector-modera-
tor cooling, circuit was likely to be substantially
higher than that originally estimated. In order to
provide for this probable increase in pressure drop,
larger and higher-speed motors are being ordered
for the sodium-pump drives. Equipment is being
assembled for water flow tests on the crucial ele-
ments of the sodium circuit, in porticular, the
beryllium cooling holes and annuli and the mani-

fold ‘at the inlet. to the beryllium. - ‘Preliminary .

Fuel Pumps ond Expansion Tank

Further test work on the fuel pump prepared for
the high-temperature test performance rigs has
indicated that the cavitation limit is somewhat
lower than had been anticipated from the early
water tests. This condition could be improved
substantially, as indicated by the early water
tests, through the use of a modified impeller vane,
which would be somewhat more, but not unreason-
ably, difficult to fabricate. Indications are, how-
ever, that the increased cavitation suppression
head required to obtain satisfactory operation with
the present impellers is not excessive and can be
accommodated readily by increasing the fuel ex-
pansion tank pressuwe by about 10 psi. This
problem is still being investigated (see Chap. 1.4,
**Component Development and Testing’’).

Tests on the north-head fuel pump and expansion
tank assembly have shown that satisfactory op-
eration can be obtained with fuel levels in the fuel
expansion tank running from ]/2 to 3 in. with no
objectionable aeration or pressure fluctuations in
the system over the entire speed range. Test work
is being continued with this setup in an effort to
reduce the pressure difference between the fuel
pump inlet and the expansion tank, and to improve
its performance with one pump out or with one
pump at a substantially different speed from the
other. Reduction of the pressure differential be-
tween the pump inlet and the expansion tank is

important - because this pressure differential will

largely determine the stresses in the upper and
lower decks of the north head. It is believed that

 rather- snioll modifications in the details of the

bleed passages coupling the pump inlet with the

" exponslon tank will permit a very marked reduction
in this _pressure dlfferentral

Fuel Recovery Tonk

The prehmmory desrgn of the fuel recovery tonk

" has been completed. The ‘tank has been designed
“on the premise that no electrical, cooling, or other
lines need be connected to ithe tonk at the time
~that it is removed from the cell. . This means that
" the - afterheat being generated in the fuel must

balance the heat losses to convection and radi-

ation to hold the temperature in the fuel between

17

 
 

 

 

ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

its melting point and 1600°F. Because of the
sharp increase in radiation heat losses with tem-
perature this provides a fairly wide latitude. In
addition, the tank has been designed so that the
amount of air circulating up between the four 8-in.-
dia fuel tanks and the lead shield will be con-
trollable, and hence the air flow through this
stack-type of thermal-convection cooling system
can be varied. It is believed that in this way it

~.will be possible to hold the fuel temperature in the

tank within the desired limits throughout a period
of approximately 30 days, starting about 10 days
after shutdown. Removal of the fuel from the cell
to the reprocessing facility within 10 days of time
‘of shutdown has been considered to be very im-
portant as a demonstration of the practicality of
such an operation and, hence, the possibilities for

operating with a low fuel inventory in a complete

operational system.

APPLIED MECHANICS AND STRESS ANALYSIS

R. V. Meghreblian
Reactor Support

The complete reactor and shield assembly is to
be suspended from an overhead bridgelike struc-
ture, as shown in Fig. 1.1.1. Although the shield
components will be in close contact with the outer
shell of the reactor, the weight of these members
will not be carried by the reactor. A separate
system of tension members is to be provided for
this purpose, and these members will transmit the
shield loads directly to the bridge structure. The
weight of the reactor will be transmitted to the
bridge structure through the four pump barrels.
The attachment of the individual barrels to the
bridge will allow horizontal motion of the barrels
in order to accommodate the relative thermal
growth between the reactor {at operating tempera-
ture) and the bridge (ot room temperature).  Verti-
cal motlon of the barrels will be restrained through
Fabreeka! pads, which are sufficiently resilient to
distribute the load fairly uniformly between the
four barrels. The bridge will be fixed ot each end

to a flexible column consisting of 1.0-in.-thick
steel plates, 28 in. wide and 123 in. long. The
load carried by each column will be approximately

fourth and one-half the load required to cripple the
column. A precise figure cannot be given since
the "‘end condition’ of the top of the column is
not well-defined.

The principal function of the flemble co!umns is
to allow the NaK lines, which remove the heat
from the reactor, complete freedom when expanding

from room temperature to the operating temperature -

of the reactor (Fig. 1.1.2). During full-power op-
eration, the upper row of NaK lines will be at
1070°F and the lower row at 1500°F. This will
result in horizontal growth of 0.75 in. in the upper
lines and 1.125 in. in the lower. If the reactor
were mounted in the cold condition precisely over
the center line of the column bases, these expan-
sions would translate and rotate the reactor out of
the neutral position and thereby cause bending
stresses in the columns (Fig. 1.1.22). The present
plan is to precut the NoK lines short by the
amounts mentioned above so that at room tempera-
twe the reactor will be located 1.0 in. off the
neutral position. This displacement will be toward
the cell wall through which the NaK lines enter
(Fig. 1.1.2¢c). As the reactor heats up, the NaK
tines will expand and move the reactor back to the
neutral position and thus remove the bending loads
on the columns and the axial loads in the pipes

(Fig. 1.1.25).

NaK Piping Inside Reactor Cell

The flexible columns described above will allow
for gross expansions of the NaK lines, but they
do not provide for differential expansion between
the lines of any one row. In order to provide some
margin for operational incidents and accidents?

and greater freedom in controlling NaK tempera-

tures, some additional flexibility has been intro-
duced into the piping inside the cell. This has
been accomplished by the addition of several
bends in each line. The bends will accommodate
300 to 400°F temperature differences between

adjacent lines. A horizontal view of the NaK

 

2For example, the failure of the pump in any given
NaK circuit would cause o change in the temperature
of the pipes, and this in turn would produce thermal
deformations in the piping relative to the plpmg in the
other NaK circuits.

piping inside the test cell is presented in Fig.
1.1.3. This layout was selected on the basis of a
hand calculation for which the method of Spielvogel3
was used. A more exacting analysis, which in-
cludes a careful study of the manifolding system,
is now under way at the M. W. Kellogg Co. These
calculations are being carried out with the aid of
fast computing machines.

A general schematic diagram of a complete NaK
circuit is shown in Fig. 1.1.4. The essential
feature of this system is that the. NaK lines are
rigidly attached at only one point, the reactor cell

wall. The ends of each circuit, which terminate

at the reactor and at the pump-radiator assembly,
have considerable freedom to expand. The only

constraints imposed on individual lines of a given -

circuit arise from the differential thermal growth
between the various lines as a result of differences
in length and irregularities in temperature control.
The NaK piping external to the reactor cell was
- described previously.4 ‘

The principal stresses in the NaK lines will be
due to the therma!l effects described above. Each
time the reactor system passes from one operating
condition to another, there will be a redistribution
of the thermal stresses in the various lines. The
stresses produced by relative thermal growths do

not persist for all time, however. Relaxation tests

(see Chap. 3.5, ‘“Mechanical Properties Studies'’)
indicate that stresses due to a fixed strain, such
as that present here, decay rapidly. This decay
takes place as more and more of the initial strain
on the member is transformed to plastic deformo-

tion. The decay is sufficiently rapid that the

plastic strain developed in a matter of minutes
after loading is a significant fraction of that which
would be developed in several hours. Thus with
each change in operating conditions, the thermally
loaded members will be subjected to some plastic

deformation. An important criterion for design,

then, is the strain-cycle life to which a given
member can be subjected.

The strain-cycle criterion was used as a basis’

for the design of the NaK lines. The objective of

various analyses now under way, therefore, is the

determination of the plastic strain that will be
 

 

 

o

developed with each chonge in operating condi-
tions. The results will then be compared with
strain-cycling data by using a Coffin® type of cor-
relation. Some data for Inconel are presently
available,® and additional information is now being
collected ot the University of Alabama and at

ORNL.

Fill-and-Drain Tank and Support

- On the basis of the present design and the op-
erational philosophy of the ART system, there is
some reason to believe that the safest position for
the fuel during the normal progress of the experi-
ment will be in the reactor proper, because in the
event of trouble it will be easier to dump the fuel
into the fill-and-drain tank than to pressurize the
fuel back into the reactor. It has been suggested
that this may also be the safest place for the fuel
during certain off-design situations, such as the
one-pump-out condition, partly for the same reason

and partly because of the increased probability of
a failure duwring the switching operations associ-
ated with an emergency condition. A study is now
under way to determine the validity of these
premises. In addition, there are several off-design
conditions and accidents in which it will be
clearly unsafe to leave the fuel in the reactor; for
example, if there is an internal leak between the
fuel and sodium (or NaK) systems, a chemical
reaction might occur which could produce metallic
vranium.” Under certain operating conditions, the
vranivm could be deposited throughout the hot
portions of the fuel circuit. In order to control
these reactions and to minimize their effects, it
would be necessary to remove the fuel from the
reactor. '

A fuel fill-and-drain tank for receiving the fuel
is incorporated in the ART system design (Fig.
1.1.5). The tank will be an Inconel cylinder 38 in.

in diameter and 38 in. in length, which will be

kept at a steady-state temperature of 1100°F by

means of a continuous flow of NaK from two in-
dependent external circuits. These circuits have

several functions. First, they will remove the
decay afterheat from the fuel following a dump;
second, they will keep the fuel above its freezing
point at long times after the dump has occurred
and the decay heat has been dissipated; and, third,
they will maintain the tank at a sufficiently high
temperature to minimize thermal shock effects
when a dump takes place.

The design heat load for the tank is ]75 Mw

even though it is estimated that the decay heat

at the instant of shutdown after operation at 60

~ Mw for one month would be 3.6 Mw. This reduced

operational requirement is based. on the premise

" that the fuel will be cooled,in th:e‘ Vreoctor"to
1200°F before a dump and that @ minimum of 8 sec -
‘will elapse after the coolant rod ‘has been fully

inserted and before the dump valves are opened.

~ Each of the two NaK cooling circuits will be

capable of extracting the 1.75 Mw of decay heat
under these conditions; however, it is expected
that under one-circuit operation, the fuel and metal
temperatures at certain locations within the tank

. may be as high-as 2000°F. Such short-time effects

will ‘not be encountered during o normal dump.
During normal operation, both circuits will be in
use, and the maximum metal temperature is not

~expected to exceed 1600°F.

The primary structural loads within the tonk will
be due to the NaK pumping pressure of 40 psi.

- Since the tank is to serve as an ever-safe deposi-
tory for the fuel, it is necessary that it be capable .

of surviving some 2000 hr of continuous operation

at temperature and possibly several fast dumps.

The principal structural requirements of the tank,

then, - are based on. creep-rupture ond thermol-:_____};

Analyses show thot the most sensmve areas in -
this design are at the - joints’ between the tube_,f-

~of tube-burst tests. Fmolly, because -of ‘the im-~ *
'portunce of thls component to the over—o“ sofety,
of the experiment, it'is planned to test the entire

tank assembly by using one of the NaK circuits.
The test should demonstrate the adequacy of the

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1956

design in withstanding the creep and thermal shock
effects mentioned above.

The support of the fill-and-drain tank assembly
will be accomplished by means of a nitrogen
cylinder located beneath the tank (Fig. 1.1.6).
Although the tank will be attached rigidly to the
reactor pressure shell through the fuel drain lines,
the major portion of the tank weight will not be
allowed to bear on the shell. The total weight of

~the tank, including the fuel, will be 6000 Ib, of

which 5000 b will be carried by the nitrogen
cylinder. The weight of the tank without the fuel

" will be 4000 Ib. This support arrangement intro-

duces some complication in the stability aspects

~ of the system, but calculations show that the

proposed distribution of lever arms, structural
stiffness of the drain lines, and the weights are
‘well within the stability limits of the system.

In the event of the failure of the nitrogen cylin-
der, all the tank weight will be exerted upon the
drain line and reactor pressure shell, This situa-
tion will produce high local stresses in the shell
at the points where the two drain lines will be
attached and will add an additional 1000 Ib to the
load in each pump barrel. Although this will re-
duce the design safety margin in these com-
ponents, the system can support the tank in this
manner. The purpose of the nitrogen cylinder,

- then, is to reduce the operating loads in the

barrels and in the pressure shell.

Core-Shell Low-Frequency Thermal-Cycling Test

A one-fourth-scale model of the core shells is

. presently being subjected to the long-time tempera-
ture variations expected in the reactor as a result
- “of chonges in power level (see Chap. 1.4, ‘‘Com-
"f'_-ponent Development and Testing’’). Such tempera-
~ ture ‘variations: produce thermal . distortions in the:

shells, “and - these effects. are among the most
severe condntlons ‘imposed on the shells.” The

that ‘the reacfor will be Cycled from the idle condi-

equator it plcked up a pattern of rotation centered
around the core axis and was, in general, typical
of the flow obtained in this region with other inlet
configurations.

A lack of circumferential symmetry was noted in
the flow pattern produced by these guide vanes.

Previous configurations have not been perfectly -

symmetrical in this respect, but this system ap-
pears to be worse than the others. It is possible

that the vanes themselves were not symmetrical.

They are complex in shape and have no suitable
reference surface to use in effecting their align-
ment.  This analysis of the flow is based on
observations of injected dye, and there are no

quantitative data on this system. The decidedly

three-dimensional character of the flow made the
use of claw-probe traverses impractical.

Complete probe traverses were made of the same
core-header combination without inlet guide vanes.
Circumferential  asymmetry of the axial velocity
profiles, as indicated by the maximum deviation of
the reading of either. of two probes at each station
from the average, was as follows:

- The profiles given by the two probes at each sta-
‘tion were, in general, similar in shape.

In an effort to obtain information on the heat
conduction to be expected through the core shells,
local heat transfer coefficients were calculated by

Reynolds number analogy from the probe survey

data extrapolated to the walls by means of uni-
versal velocity distribution equations.'®  The
local coefficients thus obtained were then inte-
grated from the wall out into the stream to obtain
the film conductivity. The integration was carried
out for an arbitrary distance of 0.010 in. from the
wall. This dimension was chosen because further
depth did not result in an appreciable change in
the film conductivity. The fuel assumed for these
caleculations was the mixture (No. 30) NaF- ZrF -

COMPARISON OF BASIC GAMMA-RAY DATA WITH
BULK SHIELDING REACTOR GAMMA
HEATING MEASUREMENTS

H. W. Bertini C. M. Copenhaver

The series of experiments performed to determine
the rate of gamma heating in various target mate-
rials near the Bulk Shielding Facility (BSF) re-
actor ! afforded an opportunity for a direct verifica-
tion of the basic gamma-ray data and the method
used for the ART heat-deposition calculations.?

Such a comparison is of considerable interest,

since the agreement between the calculated results

and the results for the BSF experiments tends to

confirm the methods and data used in the ART
calculations, :
Experimental heat-generahon rates were measured

in aluminum, iron, ‘and lead samples at several

distances along the center line of the reactor, as
illustrated by Fig. 1.2.1. In the experiments,
measurements were made of the transient tempera-
tures of the samples during heating in the gamma-
ray field and during cooling after removal from the
gamma-ray field,

The calculated heat-generation rates indicate
that the energy deposition in the target metals is
due to the following principal radiation components:
1. core gamma rays,

2. reflector gamma rays (water capture gamma
rays),
3. target gamma and beta rays.
Since on Oracle code for the calcuiahon of

gomma heating in reactors of rectangular geom-

etry3+4 was available, the heat generation rate in
the target samples caused by gamma rays emanating
from the core was determined. The heat generation

Appropriate B, data were then calculated by
using an equivalent atomic number and interpo-
lating the available buildup factor datas for point
isotropic sources in homogeneous mixtures, Since
the effective Z of the core is 9.9 and the effective
Z of the reflector is 7.5, the homogeneous mixture
approximation is valid, ond an equivalent Z of 9

The BSF reactor is a thermal reactor, and there-
fore the significant gamma radiation results from
thermal neutron fission or capture. Thus, the
spectrum of prompt gamma rays plus U235 capture
gamma rays is 8.8 e~ 1-01E photons/Mev-fission.2
For 5500 kw/hr of reactor operation per day,$ the
average ~daily fission-product decay gamma-ray
energy would be about 85% of the saturation value

ray energies per thermal neutron capture in alumi-
num for the various intervals from 3 to 10 Mev were
obtained by summing up the individual contributions

1.80 Mev was added to the third group (1.5 to
3.0 Mev) to account for the decay gamma-ray energy
resulting from Al28 (half life, 2.3 min). Thermal-
neutron capture by water gives rise to a single
gamma ray, 2,23 Mev, per capture by hydrogen,

The heating in the target sample by capture
gamma rays emanating from the water reflector was
obtained by using disk sources 2 in. thick and
40 ¢m in radius. An average flux in the disk was
obtained from the qverage flux along the disk
center line, determined experimentally, ® as a func-
tion of distance from the reactor north fece, multi-
plied by 0.8 to account for the decrease in flux in
the disk radially. -

In computing the heating in the target sample
from self-absorption of gamma and beta rays re-
sulting from thermal-neutron capture in the targets,
local perturbations in flux caused by the presence
of the target sample were not considered. The only
significant beta-ray source in the target samples
was the 2,87-Mev beta ray resulting from the decay
of Al?8, This beta-ray source was assumed to be
entirely obsorbed in the aluminum somple. The
fraction of gamma rays absorbed in the target
sample was obtained from an expression by Storm
et al.® based on the straight-ahead scattering ap-
proximation for an infinite cylinder containing a
vniform source distribution. Since the expression
neglects multiple scattering effects, the energy
absorbed in each cylinder was taken as the mean
of the values calculated by using the energy-
absorption and the total-absorption cross sections.

A comparison of the experimental and calculated
results is shown in Fig. 1.2.1. The rounding of the
calculated curves close to the reactor surface
results from the peaking of the thermal fiux curve
in the reflector region. The magnitudes of the ex-
perimental and calculated values agree quite well
where the Z of the target metal is close to the Z of
the surrounding mixture, Z = 9, but the agreement
becomes worse as the difference in the atomic
numbers increases. For materials having similar
Z's, the equivalent Z method should yield good
results, as confirmed by the aluminum sample.
However, for a heavy Z material following a light
Z material, the large, low-energy spectrum built up
in the light Z material is highly absorbed in the
first mean free path of the heavy Z material, ond o

buildup factor based upon @ homogeneous mixture
will yield a low result that becomes less and less
accurate as the depth of penetration in the light
material increases. This light-heavy sequence
phenomenon has also been indicated by Monte
Carlo calculations of gomma-ray energy deposition
for water-lead slabs. ?

In view of the good agreement between the exper-

imental ond calculated heat-generation values for

- samples near the BSF reactor, it seems reasonable

to conclude that the basic gamma-ray data given
elsewhere,? ysed in conjunction with the Pratt &
Whitney gamma-ray deposition code, should give
representative results for the gamma-ray heat de-

_position in various parts of the ART.

GAMMA-RAY HEATING IN ART

R. B. Stevenson

Gamma-Ray Source Strength

The gamma-ray source strengths of the island,
core shells, fuel, and reflector-moderator of the
ART were determined so that a calculation of the
heating due to these gamma rays could be carried
out. The prompt, decay, and nonfission capture
gamma rays in the fuel, the gamma rays caused by
inelastic neutron scattering in the fuel, and the

caopture gamma rays in the Inconel core shells,

beryllium, and the sodium coolant were taken into
account in the calculation of the gamma-ray source
strengths., |

The capture gamma rays and the gamma rays
caused by inelastic scattering were computed by
using neutron fluxes determined by a Curtiss-Wright
two-dimensional neutron calculation for the ART.

The gomma rays resulting from inelastic scattering

were assumed to be emitted with an energy of
1 Mev. The distribution of the prompt and decay
gamma rays in the fuel was calculated from the
fission power distribution determined from. the

Curtiss-Wright two-dimensional neutron calculation -

and from an analysis of the hlgh- emperature criti-
cal experiment, 10 '

In both the Curﬂss-erght two-dnmens:onol cal-
culation and the determination of the gamma-ray
source strength, the ART was divided intc a large
number - of regions, the materials in each region
being conmdered to be homogeneous for ease of

computation. The basic data for the calculation of
the gamma-ray sources were taken from a report by
H. W. Bertini et al. 11

The results of these calculations are shown in
Figs. 1.2.2, 1.2.3, and 1.2.4. The distribution of
the gamma-ray sources in the island, fuel, and
reflector-moderator is shown in Fig. 1.2.2. The
values given, in w/em3, are the sums over the
seven energy groups actually used. The distribu-
tion of the gamma-ray source strengthin the Inconel
core shells as a function of the distance from the
equatorial plane is given in Fig. 1.2.3, while
Fig. 1.2.4 gives the source strength in the region
adjacent to the control rod (a combination of sedium
and Inconel) as a function of distance from the
equatorial plane. The values given in these plots
are felt to be fairly accurate, although there may
be some discrepancies near the Inconel core shells
due to the approximations in geometry used in the
neutron flux calculations.

There is some ambiguity in the source strength
values assigned to the Inconel core shells, and the
values may be in error by as much as 20%. This
ambiguity arises from the fact that use was made
of two different two-dimensional neutron calcula-
tions in determining the core shell neutron absorp-
tions. One neutron calculation was for the high-
temperature critical experiment, which contained
no sodium, while the second was for the ART with
four times more sodium than will be present, The
resulting neutron absorptions in the core shells are
quite different for these two cases, so an appropri-
ate average was used in calculating the values
given in Fig. 1.2.3.

The gamma-ray source strength in the core shells
represents the absorption of approximately. 3.1% of

_the total number of neutrons. This is substantially

lower than the figure of 7.5% which was obtained
for o spherical mockup of the ART, However, re-
cent calculations!? of the Pratt & Whitney reactor,
with both spherical and cylindrical geometry, have
shown that for a cylindrical mockup the percentage
of neutrons absorbed in the core shells is less
than that for a spherical mockup by about a factor
of 2. Thus the figure of 3.1% obtained from the

two-dimensional neutron calculations does not

seem to be inconsistent with figures obtained for a
spherical mockup of the ART.

The total gamma-ray source strength in the ART
was found to be 4.6 Mw, of which approximately
4.1 Mw comes from the core, and 0.28 Mw comes
from the Inconel core shells. The remainder comes
from the copture gamma rays in the island and the
reflector-moderator.

Gamma-Ray Heating

The heating resulting from the gamma-ray sources
described above has been obtained by using a two-
dimensional gamma-ray heating calculation. The
calculation, which was carried out on an IBM-704
computer, utilized a program developed by Kniedler
and Wenzel of Pratt & Whitney Aircraft. The

program uses a buildup factor approach to account

32

for the scattered gamma-ray photons. In the case
described here, the buildup factor for water was
used throughout the reactor. -
The sources were computed at a number of points
in the reactor, the volume associated with each
source point being approximately a cube 4 ¢cm on @
side, Each source was divided into seven energy
groups. The heating was determined at @ large
number of points for each energy group for _all
source points within a specified distance from the
heating point. This distance was taken as 40 cm.
Thus, a point at the outside of the reflector on the
equatorial plane ‘‘sees’’ the entire fuel system
source on the equator. | '
The results are shown in Figs. 1.2,5, 1.2.6, and
1.2.7. The heating in the island, core, and re-
flector-moderator are shown in Fig. 1.2,5. The

The uncertainty in the source strength of the
Inconel core shells does not have much of an effect
on the heating values, since the source of gamma
rays in the core is so much greater than that in the
core shells, A test calculation has shown that a
50% change in the source strength of the core
shells will change the heating values at a point
close to the core shells by less than 5%.

The total gamma-ray energy deposition (excluding
that caused by sources in- the heat exchanger
region) in the reactor was found to be 3.86 Mw,
which amounts to approximotely 84% of the total

“source. This means that about 16% of the gamma-

ray source energy escapes,

REFLECTOR-MODERATOR TEMPERATURE
CONTROL SIMULATION

J. M. Eastman! F. P. Green
E. R. Mann

The ART simulator was used for a study of a

_reflectorfmoderator temperature control. system and

the temperature responses of the cooling system

~ which will circulate sodium through the reflector-

moderator and through sodium-to-NaK heat ex-

-changers. The NaK is cooled in external NaK-to-
. air radiators. With the reactor held at design-point

conditions, abrupt closure of the louvers of one of

the two NaK-to-air radiators caused an increase of

approximately 100°F in the maximum sodium tem-
perature (ot the core outlet) and in the mean
beryllium temperature. The response was essen-
tially first order, with a time constant of approxi-
mately 2‘/3 min. A 50% reduction in power from
design-point conditions caused o decrease of
about 150°F in the maximum sodium temperature
ond in the mean beryllium temperature, with a time
constant of approximately 3 min. For operation at
50% power, an abrupt change of the mean fuel
temperature from 1425 to 1250°F caused a de-
crease of about 160°F in the maximum sodium and
the mean beryllium temperatures, with, again,
about @ 3-min time constant.

The mean reflector-moderator temperature was
computed in the process of simulation and was
used as the main criterion for evaluating the tem-
perature control system. ‘A control system was
evolved which performed satisfactorily and will be
used for the ART. The control method consisted
in (1) holding constant a signal composed of the

‘maximum  sodium temperature biased with the

temperature differential in the NaK across the
radiators and (2) causing the louvers to open when

‘this signal exceeded its set value by more than

2°F and to close when the signal became less
than the set value by more than 2°F.  This ar-
rangement provided a proportionality characteristic
adjusted to cause the maximum sodium tempera-
ture to be held at 1200°F for zero reactor power
and 1250°F for design-point power. These are

the values calculated (ond built into the simula-
tor) for holding the mean beryllium temperature
constant at 1200°F. The louver actuating speed
was adjusted to give full stroke in 30 sec.

This control system was operated on the simu-
lator with.step changes between 0, 50, and 100%
design power and between 1200 and 1425°F mean
fuel temperature (at 50% and at zero power). For
these disturbances the mean moderator tempera-
ture was held constant to within £15°F. The
system was not stable in the sense that the
louvers remained fixed for steady-state conditions.
In order to maintain the desired temperatures, the
control system caused the louvers to shift posi-
tions at 30- to 60-sec intervals. When the tem-
perature control system hardware has been as-
sembled, it will be checked on the simulator,

Fuel-Expansion-Tank Level Indicator
R. F. Hyland

Tests were continued on a helium-bubbler type
of level indicator, described previously,? for the
ART fuel expansion tank. In these preliminary
tests made to check the operation of the bubbler,
two bubbler tubes are used and the fuel is static.
One test rig was shut down after 3000 hr of opera-
tion at a fuel temperature of 1150°F; neither
bubbler tube had clogged. Another rig has com-
pleted 2686 hr at 1500°F, and another has com-

pleted 2352 hr at 1500°F. In both these rigs one

of the two bubbler tubes has become clogged.
Examination of a bubbler tube from the rig that
was terminated showed that o thin film had de-
posited on the inner surface. A chemical analysis
of a 10-mg sample of the film showed it to contain
7 mg ZrO, and about 1.8 mg O,. - Since the helium
supply of the building contains an average of
1.5. ppm O,, sufficient oxygen was present in
1000 liters of helium (the approximate flow for a
75-hr period) to account for the entire 1.8 mg of
O,, if complete reaction is assumed. Analyses

of the contents of two bubbler tubes that plugged
in a previous test at 1500°F, during which the
system was accidentally contaminated with oxy-
gen, also showed high ZrO2 contents. It is ap-
parent therefore that the cause of bubbler-tube
clogging is oxygen contamination and the subse-
quent formation of Z0,, a high-melting-point
(3000°C) solid, rather than ZrF ,-vapor deposits
or fuel, as anticipated. It is planned to use either
a NaK ‘scrubber or the incandescent-titanium-
sponge method to purify the helium used in further
tests.

Systems for Testing Liquid-Level-Sensing
Devices in Flowing Liquids

“H. J. Metz

Three test systems are being constructed for
studying the operational characteristics of various
liquid-level-sensing devices under controlled con-
ditions in flowing liquids. The test system con-
sists of pressure vessels at both ends of a motor-
driven teeter-totter. Liquid will flow from the
rising vessel to the vessel going down and the
liquid levels in the vessels will remain constant.
A gear-motor drive is provided which can rock the
vessels at a rate of 0 to 10 cpm. A helium atmos-
phere at a pressure of about 1 to 3 psig is pro-
vided in a closed circuit over the vessels to pre-
vent contamination of the fluid., The desired
temperatures are obtained and maintained with
heaters and variable autotransformers,

Each vessel has six spark-plug probes con-
nected to level-indicating lamps, and the liquid
levels in the vessels can be adjusted from 1 to
10 in. Two level-sensing devices can be tested
in each vessel at various levels. The tests will
be of long duration to assure that the level-sensing
devices will work for 2000 to 3000 hr with the

surface of the fluid in constant motion.

High-Temperature Turbine-Type Flowmeter
G. H. Burger

The first turbine-type flowmeter was designed
and built in October 1955 for measuring flow in
l-in.-ID tubing. Since then numerous tests have
been made in order to determine the operating

characteristics and the life of the units. The
initial design has been modified as test data have
indicated the need for changes and three succes-
sive models have been built.?

The test results obtained thus far have been
disappointing, particularly the life test results.
As stated above, four flowmeters have been tested,
but none has even approached the required 3000 hr
of operation. The brevity of the test, however, in
all cases except the first, has been due to system
failures, such as pipe leaks and pump difficulties.

Performance tests of the ‘vnits have been quite

satisfactory. The units have ‘been tested in both
NaK and fused-salt fuel mixtures with excellent
results. The accuracy of the measurements in the
NaK system have been well within 1%, as checked
against a magnetic flowmeter and venturi. . The
accuracy of the units in the fused-salt mixtures
could not be precisely determined because of the
absence of a venturi in the system. The salt sys-
tem also had a very low maximum flow rate which
was out of the design range of the flowmeter. The
bearing material and the bearing design of the unit
tested in the fused salt appeared to be satis-
factory, since no evidence of bearing-sticking or
self-welding was evident from the operation of the
units or from metallurgical examination of the
units after removal from the system. The turbine
blades and the turbine bedy appeared to be un-
marked by the fuel or the NaK, Even though the
tests in fuel and in NaK have been.relatively
short, in the neighborhood of 300 hr, the units
have operated at temperatures up to 1500°F, and
the indications are that the units can be expected
to operate satisfactorily for 3000 hr.
- A fifth model of the flowmeter has been fabri-
cated which incorporates improved bearings. - The
water test and calibration of the unit have been
completed, and it appears to be quite satisfactory.
A similar turbine-type flowmeter with a 3}§-in.-dic
housing has been designed for operation in a sys-
tem with flow rates up to 1400 gpm and is now
being fabricated. This unit will be evaluated in
a loop for testing NaK pumps. It will be cali-
brated against a venturi installed in the system.

Thermocouple Data Reduction

Life tests were begun on two 5ynchron|zed h:gh-
speed mercury-jet switches, described prev;ously,

- which operate at 1800 rpm and scan 80 thermo-
' couple signals per revolution.

The input signal
to the transmitter switch consists of a voltage-

'dlwder network with 79 one-millivolt increments
i and one 0.5-v tap, which triggers the sweep of a

17-in. oscilloscope. The ‘oscilloscope monitors
the common line between the switches. The input
signal produces o stair-stepped trace that ranges

Testing of elastomers for seal application has

test samples of recommended materials. A test
was conducted, however, in which Cellulube 150
and Buna-N base elastomers were used. Since

Cellulube 150 requires the use of butyl rubber

elastomers, the results, as expected, were poor
with respect to strength and hardness of the seal
The Buna-N O-rings did, however, main-
tain a satisfactory seal throughout the 800 hr of

tor cell. Attenuation of the fission-gas concentra-..

tion by a factor of 10'® from the fuel expansion
tank to the lubricant reservoir was considered to
be necessary to eliminate biological shielding of
the lubricant systems. Preliminary test data in-
dicate attenuation by a factor of at least 104 from
the expansion tank to the pump shaft seal and by
another factor of at least 104 between the seal and
the reservoir. These data are being analyzed to
determine the | upper limit to be expected for the
radiation dose from the lubrlcahng-orl tank.

Fuel Pump Development Tests

S AW Simon !
M. E. Lackey "~ G. Samuels

Developmental test work on the fuel pump im-
peller’ continued, with water belng used as the
pumped fluid. Efforts are under way to reduce the
maognitude of the system pressure fluctuations, to
produce the desired gas pressure gradient down
the shaft annulus in the direction of the purge gas
fiow, to determine the fuel flow through the centri-
fuge, to reduce the pressure level of the system to
meet the stress limitations of the north-head deck
plate, and to obtain cavitation data. Some of
these problems are, as yet, only partly solved.

Part of the work on the reduction of the magni-
tude of the pressure fluctuations has been carried
on in conjunction with the efforts to obtain the
desired gas pressure gradient down the pump shaft
into the expansion tank and out into the off-gas
line. These two problems are interrelated -be-
cause both are affected by the upper seal face of
the slinger impeller, area 1 in Fig. 1.4.1. The
increase in the pressure fluctuations that was
experienced  duwing operation with high liquid
levels in the expansion tank can be attributed to
the priming and unpriming of the slinger impeller
or perhaps to a hunting of the liquid level on the
face of this impeller. As changes were made to
the slinger impeller in attempts to remove the
pressure fluctuations, the changes .in the gas pres-
‘sure gradient were noted. With the original slinger
impeller design, complete with 12 blades on the
upper. surface, both the fluctuations and the re-
verse pressure gradient were at their maximums.
The reverse pressure gradient indicated that the
upper seal face of the slinger impeller could act
as an effective gas pump and cause gas pressure
in the expansion tank to build up to greater than

40

~ the gas sipply pressure, with the gas pressure in

the oil-leakage catch basin in the rotary element
being the lowest pressure in the system. This
condition would be especially undesirable if the
pump stopped abruptly or even if there were a
sudden reduction in the pump speed, beccuse the
gas pressures would be such that fuel might be
forced into the seal region of the rotary element.

The upper seal face of the slinger impelier has
been modified so that it is a smooth disk, and the
axial clearance, as well as the radlal clearance,
of the impeller is kept as small as possrble This
configuration keeps the amount of liquid in and
around the impeller face to a minimum, regardless
of the liquid level in the expansion tank. Opero-
tion with this modlfied impeller produced a normal
gas pressure drop in the direction of flow, with the
oil-catch-basin gas pressure being ot an lnter-
mediate level and acbove the expansion tank gas
pressure. Further modlflcahons of this region are
being tested in an attempt to provide a pressure
equalizing volume that may be necessary for
alieviating any possible unequal liquid level dis-
tribution around the pump shaft. These tests will
provide a basic shape for further development
tests in the twin-pump aluminum-north-head water
tests, where the effects of unequal pump speeds
can be noted. ‘

A ‘second trouble area with respect to pressure
fluctuations was found to exist at the lower face
of the slinger, that is, the degassing. face of the
slinger impeller, which is area 2 of Fig. 1.4.1.
The first mocllﬁcahon for correchng thls situation
consisted in simply rémoving the vanes, or blades,
from the impeller face. The resulting large clear-

ance rendered the degassing feature of the centri-

fuge ineffective. The shape that appears to
function acceptably consists of a smooth dlsk that
maintains the previous clearances. ‘

Mcdifications were also made to the seal plate
over the centrifuge cup, area 3 of Fig. 1.4.1, in an
effort to reduce the centrifuge leakage flow. A
lip was added that extended vertically downward
from the inner surface of the seal plate to the top
of the centrifuge cup. This resulted in operation
that was, in general, poorer than before. The
pressure fluctuations were greater and the degas-
sing time was longer ‘because the greatly in-
creased velocity of the liquid discharging into the
already restricted flow area only further restricted
the centrifuge cup inlet flow. When this. lip was

removed and a similar one placed on the outer
surface of the seal plate, the operation of the pump
was improved. In locating this lip on the outer
surface, the axial clearance from the lower edge
of the lip to the top of the centrifuge cup was
made identical to that existing between the top of
the centrifuge seal vanes and the lower side of the
seal plate. While this modification increased the
resistance of the flow passage from the centrifuge
discharge holes, area 4 of Fig. 1.4.1, to the
centrifuge inlet, it did not reduce the available
head of the seal vanes on the top of the centrifuge
cup and thus did not affect the discharge pressure
of the centrifuge in any way. This reduced flow
has less effect upon the character of the flow at
the centrifuge inlet, and pressure fluctuations are
therefore less.

Another series of tests was performed to deter-
mine the amount of flow that passes through the
shaft feed holes, area 5 of Fig. 1.4.1, the ex-
pansion tank, and the centrifuge. An indirect
method was used to measure the flow, since it is
virtually impossible to measure it directly. The
internal xenon-removal feed flow up the shaft was
blocked, and data were token while known xenon-
removal feed flows were added to the expansion
tank through on external circuit. The pressure
difference between the expansion tank and the
pump suction was plotted vs the external circuit
flow for a constant main loop flow and a constant
pump speed. This pressure difference was equated
to the difference determined with the unblocked
shaft. The shaft flow was computed from this
pressure difference and was found to be approxi-
mately 11.5 gpm.

The reduction of the fuel system pressure level
will be attempted by two methods. The first will
involve reducing the size of the centrifuge dis-
charge holes in an attempt to reduce the head de-
veloped by the centrifuge. The second will in-
volve increasing the internal diameter of the
centrifuge cup to reduce the centrifuge head.
Results of incomplete tests performed on each of
these modifications indicated that each will allow
a reduction of the pressure level to obtain an
acceptable stress in the north-head upper and
lower decks. The final selection of one of these
modifications will be determined by future tests
concerning the stability of the pressure level as
a function of the liquid level in the expansion tank.

The results from some initial test runs indicated
that a potential problem of cavitation exists with
the present impeller blade desngn Values of
Thoma's cavitation parameter,® o, are about 0.71
for 2400 rpm and 0.51 for 2700 rpm. An impeller
with new blades having an improved entrance
angle was tested for cavitation, and o was found
to be about 0.54 for 2400 rpm and 0.41 for 2700
rpm. Investigations of the cavitation characteris-
tics of the present impeller design will be con-
tinved.

Fuel Pump Endurance Tests
S. M. DeCamp, Jr.

An endurance test of an ART fuel (MF-2) pump'
was started’ on April 10, 1956, and was terminated
on July 2, 1956, after 1964 hr of operation. Op-
eration during this period was satisfactory.
Troubles experienced earlier® with gas flow down
the pump shaft and with removal of oil from the
lower catch basin drain did not recur. Removal
of the pump from the pump barrel was relatively
easy, and disassembly of the pump was accom-
plished by heating the pump impeller and as-
sociated equipment and removing the parts while
they were still hot.

The test was terminated when the operating
sounds of the pump changed and the source of the
sounds could not be definitely located. Examina-
tion of the components after disassemb|y gave no
indication of trouble in the pump. It was reas-
sembled and installed in the cold mechanical
shakedown stand, where it was run for 100 hr. At
the end of this period the pump was operating

“satisfactorily, with no leakage detectable at the

lower seal.

The pump and a new hydraulic motor were then
reinstalled in the high-temperature endurance stand
for further testing. At the end of 400 hr, the pump
was still operating satisfactorily, with no sign of
lower seal leakage. Operation of this pump'is
continuing.

Sodium Pump Development Tests
S. M. DeCamp, Jr.

Water testing of an ART sodium pump in a per-
formance-acceptance loop, initiated previously,?
was continved. The tests conducted previously
were aimed at solving the problems of bypass flow
around the main impeller and ingassing of the main
fluid circuit. The bypass flow was from pump
discharge through a pressure breakdown labyrinth
to the expansion tank, and it was returned to pump
suction. Bypass flows as high as 10 gpm were
possible without ingassing with this bypass flow
circuit. Examination of the reactor north-head
geometry and thermal stress conditions, however,
indicated that bypass flow of this type was un-
desirable because of the low sodium temperature
(1050°F) in the expansion tank. A preferred solu-
tion is to bring hot sodium (1250°F) from directly

below the lower deck of the sodium expansion

tank to cool the top lid of the sodium tank and then
to return this flow to pump discharge by means of
a centrifuge. ,

Various conflgurcﬂons of the flow passages

above the centrifuge have been tested.  The most

recently tested configuration is shown in Fig.
1.4.2, and performance curves obtained for the
configuration are presented in Fig. 1.4.3.

It became apparent in earlier tests that the size
of the slot in the side of the pump barrel was in-
adequate to handle the return flow of liquid to the
centrifuge. In order to handle the required flow, a
second slot was cut into the barrel below the
original slot. The addition of this slot increased
the maximum obtainable flow into the centrifuge

tion of the loop

loop made up of approximately 60 ft of 3}’2- and
4-in. IPS Inconel pipe. A heat exchanger and the
necessary instrumentation were added to the loop,
and water tests were conducted.

Initial tests indicated that the pump would not
prime because of excessive quantities of gas
having been trapped in the discharge pipe during
the loop filling operation. A ¥ .-in.-dia hole was
therefore drilled through the top of the discharge
pipe inside the pump tank to permit the trapped
gas to be vented during filling. After the pump
was primed, a continuous leckage of 2 to 3 gpm
flowed through this vent to the pump tank. A
baffle and a deflector were developed and in-
stalled to control the splashing caused by this
high-velocity leakage. The pump primed satis-
factorily after the vent was installed, and such a
vent will be mcorporuted into all future PK-P
pumps. .

- The water test performance data obtained on
these Inconel pump parts agree very well with

“initial data obtained with the original brass im-

peller and aluminum volute;!! however, a slightly
higher efficiency was obtained in these tests. The
cavitation performance of the Inconel impeller was
not so good as that of the brass impeller; however,
the cavitation characteristics are still considered
to be satisfactory.

Weld shrinkage tests of pump volute halves have
shown that the shrinkage can be controlled to

exception of the degree of increase in NaK pres-
suwre drop, the performance data obtained on these
radiators and heat exchangers were in substantial
agreement with data obtained from units previously
tested. The NaK pressure drop in Black, Sivalls
& Bryson heat exchanger No. 2, where heat was
transferred from fuel to NaK, did not increase

‘throughout the test, whereas, in heat exchanger

No. 1, where the heat was transferred from NaK to
fuel, there was a total NaK pressure-drop increase
of approximately 240%. This pressure-drop in-
crease is attributed to mass-transfer deposits and
has been observed as a function of time in all test
units in which NaK has been cooled.

have been installed in test stand B, and tests will
start as soon as Black, Sivalls & Bryson heat

thereafter. This latter period of operation has

been at a maximum NaK temperature of 1500°F, -

with a radiator NaK temperature drop of 100°F for

Cold-Trap Evaluation in Heat Exchanger
"~ Test Loops

F. A. Anderson 13 J. C. Amos
Two 4-in.-dia circulating cold traps equipped

with stainless steel cooling coils have been

placed in operation with no difficulties from oxide

‘plugging. The procedure listed below, which has

been proposed for - ART cold—trap startup, was
followed in each case: -
‘1. Operate with maximum cold-trap Nak ﬂow und

no cooling until main NaK system reaches 1200°F.

2. Turn qir cooling to maximum and maintain the
cold-trap inlet temperature above 1he pluggmg in-
dicator break temperature.

3. Reduce the cold-trap outlet temperature by'

reducing the cold-trap NaK flow as the break tem-
perature drops.

4. When cold-trap outlet temperature reaches '

300°F or less, transfer to water cooling and in-

 

YSConsultant from the University of Mississippi.

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1956

crease the cold-trap NaK flow to design rate. Ad-
just water flow ‘to obtain desired cold-trap tem-
peratures.

During ART operation it may be necessary, for
maintenance purposes, to cool the reactor to ap-

- proximately 300°F and subsequently reheat it. A

test was therefore run on the NaK loop of SHE
test stand C to determine whether such operation
would seriously upset the oxide balance or other-
wise cause cold-trap operating difficulties. With
a system temperature of 1100°F and the cold trap
operating at approximately 0.75 gpm at a NaK out-
let temperature of 300°F and an oxide saturation
temperature of 270°F, the main loop was cooled to
300°F and reheated without disturbing the cold-
trap NaK or coolant flows. No adverse effect on
the cold trap was noted, and at no time during the
course of the test did the oxide saturation tem-
perature rise above its initial level. The results
of this test are plotted in Fig. 1.4.7.

In order to obtain a comparison of actual and
predicted over-all heat transfer coefficients for the
cold-trap circuit, a series of tests were run on the
40-in. economizer and on the 4-in. circulating cold
trap on test stand C with water as the coolant
passing through the slightly flattened, copper
cooling coil wound around the cold trap. Experi-
mental over-all heat transfer coefficients were ob-
tained that ranged from 9.9 to 20.9, in comparison

with predicted values of ~20 Btu/hr-ft2.°F. The
coefficients increased significantly with increased
NaK flow (range, 0.45 to 1.5 gpm), but they were
essentially unaffected by a 30% variation in the
water flow rate. A plot of the over-all coefficient,
U, vs the logarithm of the NaK flow rate, x (in
gpm), yields a straight line, which can be repre-
sented by the following equation:

log x = 0.049U - 0.855 .

The over-all coefficients obtained with air used
as the coolant ranged from 7.2 to 10.7, in compari-
son to a predicted value of ~ 10 Btu/hr-ft2.°F, and
appeared to be, within experimental error, almost
independent of NaK flow rates in the range from
0.50 to 1.0 gpm. For both air and water cooling,
the over-all coefficients were based on the inside
circumferential area of the packed section of the
cold trap.

In the economizer unit the over-all coefficients
(based on the outside area of the inner pipe)
ranged from 458 to 664, in comparison with an
average calculated valve of 656 Btu/hr-ft2.°F, and
increased as the NaK flow rate increased from
0.50 to 1.5 gpm.

Since the ART cold traps will be equipped with
%-in. stainless steel cooling coils, the tests re-
ported above were repeated for an identical 4-in.
cold trap wound with the ART type of coil. With
water as the coolant, the over-all coefficients
ranged from 17.9 to 29.0 Btu/hr-f12.°F as the NaK
flow rate was increased from 0.43 to 1.25 gpm.
These values for the coefficient are approximately
50% greater than the values obtained for the trap
wound with the copper coil. |t is thought that the
higher values are a result of better contact of the
stainless steel cooling coil with the cold-trap
shell. With air as the coolant, the effect of the
better contact was again noticeable, the over-all
coefficients for the new trap being somewhat better
than those obtained for the original copper coil
trap.

WATER FLOW TESTS OF ALUMINUM
NORTH-HEAD MOCKUP

E. R. Dytko
R. E. MacPherson R. Curry!
~D. R. Ward

It was originally planned that the ART fuel sys-
tem components of the north head would be fabri-

52

cated and water-tested and then that the sodium
system components would be added for testing.
The desire to extend the fuel circuit testing and
the urgent need for starting the sodium circuit
testing have led, however, to the decision to build

a second oluminum north-head mockup for water

tests of the sodium system components. The

aluminum parts for the sodium-circuit water tests.

are about 75% completed.

Water tests that simulated reactor .fuel system
filling revealed that the addition of water into the
bottom of the system at a rate of 1 gpm with both
pumps running at 200 rpm or less caused only
minor ingassing. Most of the gas in the system
apparently vented upward into the surge tank
during filling. At pump speeds of 400 rpm, how-

-ever, the trapped gas was mixed thoroughly into

the liquid being pumped, and extensive ingassing
was observed.

In another set of experiments, water was drained
from the simulated fuel system while both pumps
were running at various matched speeds from 800
to 3000 rpm. It was found, in all cases, that the
liquid level dropped to the floor of the fuel surge
tank before ingassing could be observed. During
this drop in liquid level the pump discharge and
suction pressures dropped in unison, and the
pumping heads remained essentially constant,
When the ingassing occurred, the pump suction
pressure was within 1 psi of the surge tank pres-
sure. Final confirmation of satisfactory perform-
ance, with water, of the twin fuel pumps in the

north-head configuration will be sought when a

final impeller design has been established, based
on single pump tests.

Work has progressed on solving the problem of
pressure and flow surging in the test system. As

reported previously, 16 these pressure fluctuations

were believed to be due partly to the hydraulic
characteristics of the pump centrifuge section and
partly to the unfavorable pump inlet configuration.
In an attempt to separate these two effects, the
external circuit was rebuilt to provide a 10-dia
straight inlet to the pump suction. To further
idealize the pump inlet, straightening vanes were
provided in the inlet section. Subsequent opera-
tions demonstrated a 75% reduction in pressure
and flow fluctuations, and it is felt that some

portion of the remaining instability will be re-
lieved by the final impeller design.

The sensitivity of the loop to pump inlet geome-
try has demonstrated the desirability of mocking
up, as a later step in the fuel circuit mockup test
program, the actual reactor fuel pump inlet region.
As a further refinement to the test unit, provisions
are being made for the later addition of a full-
scale aluminum core mockup that is to be tested
in conjunction with the mockup of the reactqr pump
inlet region. T

Four ART prototype dump valves have been re-
ceived from vendors, but none have met the per-
formance specifications for ART operation. . _In
all cases the seat leakage rate was excessive, 17
Other difficulties encountered have included oxida-
tion of the flame-plated stem in air and fcnlure of
the seat-ring braze joint. The cause of the braze
joint failure has been corrected, but a satisfcéfery
oxidation-resistant flame-plated stem has nqt yet
been tested. 18

The seat materials of the valves tested thus far
were Kennametals 152B, 151A, and 162B (see
Chap. 3.4, ‘'Welding and Brazing Investigations,"’
for compositions of these cermets). These Kenna-
metals showed the greatest- resistance to solid-
phase bonding in screening tests. '

The exterior of the valve body ‘will operate in
air at a high tempe_rafure for an-extended period of
time. Therefore a ‘stem plohng which will not
oxidize is required. A Stellite:6 weld overlay on
the stem at the stem guides and an aluminum oxide
flame plate. are ‘to-be’ performance fested.

The excess;ve seat Ieakoge of the first four
prototype duinp’ ‘valves was caused by welding
distortion and. mlsahgnmen'r of the assembly prior
to final welding. - The assembly and welding pro-
cedures have’ therefore been altered in an attempt
to attain satlsfactory alignment. The seat ma-
terials were satisfactorily tested for leakage, with
water and air, ‘prior to assembly in the valves. In

In addition ‘to the Kennametals that are being
tested, tests will be made on"molybdenum, copper,

which passes through an O-ring seal to a hydraulic

operator. The seat ring and plug are shown in
Fig. 1.4.8. Salt from a sump is forced through a

dip line and against the seat and plug by helium
pressure. The leakage collects in the valve body
and drains through an overflow line into a tared
receiver. To ensure the removal of gas pockets
from the dip line, the plug is not seated in the
ring until after the salt flows through the over-
flow line. The stem thrust, the pressure dif-
ferential across the seat, and the leakage are
accurately measured. ,
The results of seat materials test No. 1, in
which the seat ring was Kennametal 162B and the
plug was Kennametal 152B, are summarized in

 

Fig. 1.4.9. The valve had been cycled 15 times
as of August 15, with the maximum leakage being
2.0 cm3/hr. The stem force is 750 Ib; the seat
pressure differential, 80 psi; and the test tempera-

‘ture, 1200°F. After 1000 hr in test, the valve will

be left closed for 500 hr to test for long-range
self-welding. , ,

Seat materials test No. 2 was terminated 24 hr
after its start because of excessive leakage.” The
seat ring material was Kennametal 152B and the

plug material was Kennametal 151A. The leak

rate was 38 em3/hr at 25-psi differential pressure
across the seat and a 750-Ib stem thrust. The
high leakage was caused by misalignment of the
stem. '

OUTER CORE SHELL THERMAL
STABILITY TEST

E. R. Dytko

R. E. MacPherson J. C. Amos
L. H. Devlin

The 300 thermal cycles scheduled for the outer
core shell thermal stability test were completed.
The model was disassembled, and the core shell
was removed for examination. Dye-penetrant and
x-ray inspections revealed no surface cracks or
internal flaws. '

Measurements were carefully made of the inside

surface of the shell by using the same procedure
as that used for obtaining measurements after
57 cycles.!? The previous measurements showed
the shell to be slightly elliptical, and after com-
pletion of 300 cycles the elliptical deformation
was even more pronounced.

 

5. Curry and A. M, Smith, ANP Quar. Prog. Rep.
June 10, 1956, ORNL-2106, p 65.

The core shell was subjected to sodium tempera-
tures of 1200°F or higher for 1050 hr. A thermal
cycle comprised 1 hr with a temperature dif-
ferential and 1 hr of isothermal operation at
1250°F. The transient time was 10 min. Bursting
pressures of 24 and 16 psi existed across the
shell at the bottom and top, respectively.

The temperatures of the sodium flowing inside
and outside the shell were measured by thermo-
couples located on the pipe walls at their respec-
tive entrances and exits to the model assembly.
During the temperature differential phase of a
‘cycle these temperatures were approximately as
follows:

Inner sodium entrance 1600°F
Inner sodium exit 1235°F
Outer sodium exit ' 1085°F
Outer sodium entrance 980°F

The temperature differential fromr the inner stream
to the outer stream, which were flowing counter-

current to one another, was 515°F at the bottom
and 255°F at the top.

The core shell will now be subjected to a creep-
buckling test at o temperature of 1500°F ond an
external pressure of 52 psi. The time to buckle
and the type of failure will be observed. A new
shell will be installed in the thermal stability test
apparatus, and a second test program, which will
be identical to the one just completed, will be
initiated. '

to test the plugging indicator and cold trap planned
for use in the 70-gal NaK systems of the ART.
These units are shown in Figs. 1.4.12 and 1.4.13.
The plugging indicator is cooled by air in the
outer jacket, and the cold trap is cooled by air or
water flowing through the stainless steel tubing
wound tightly around the packed length of the

trap. The stand will have instruments to measure

the air and water flows under various operating
conditions in order to determine utility require-
ments for the ART. The stand also has provisions
for connecting both Argonne samplers and Mine
Safety Appliances samplers in order to calibrate
the plugging indicator against chemical analysis

615°F (equivalent to 135 ppm O,), while chemical
analysis of the NaK gave only 82 ppm O,. This
type of plugging indicator was considered un-
satisfactory, because the characteristic break in
NaK flow was not obtained for oxide saturation
temperctures below 400°F. This made interpreta-
tion of low oxide contents virtually impossible.

The second type. of plugging indicator used o
plugging disk with 18 holes 0.31 in. in diameter

and one hole 0.049 in. in diameter. The stand

operated for 25 days, during which time the plug-
ging indicator was run 68 times and 47 samples
were taken for chemical analysis with two Argonne

constant conditions showed that, with the cold-
trap outlet temperatwre at 900°F (equivalent to

perature was 640°F (equivalent to 160 ppm O,),
while the chemical analysis of the NaK showed

LIQUID-METAL-VAPOR CONDENSERS

M. H. Cooper

The specification of bleed gas purges through
ART sodium and NaK pumps requires that con-
densers be provided for removing liquid metal
vapor from the exit helium streams. in addition,
the NaK dump tanks must be provided with similar
condensers capable of removing the NaK vapor
from the helium exhausted by an emergency NaK
dump.

Development work on such condensers is under
way, and the dimensions and design parameters of
the units currently being investigated are given
below:

Condenser length 60 in. 36 in.
 Helium flow rate 500 liters/day 1.7 cfm

Inlet temperature 1200°F 1200°F

Outlet temperature 200°F 600°F

Schematic test layouts are shown in Figs. 1.4.14
and 1.4.15. For the NaoK test, helium at 1200°F,
saturated with NaK vapor, was periodically vented
from the 15-ft3 sump at a flow of 1.7 c¢fm and
exhausted to the atmosphere through the con-
denser. Two condensers were tested, the second
of which was refined by adding external fins
(2}’2-in.-dia Inconel, eight per inch) and internal
Demister packing. -

The first test, for which the conditions were
those tabulated above except that the outlet tem-
perature was 300°F, was terminated after the
second cycle because of entrained NaK in the
control panel. The second test, for which fins
were added to the condenser and the outlet tem-
perature was 100°F, was terminated after 70
cycles because of entrained NaK in the control
panel. A larger trap downstream of the condenser
was used in the second test and may have been
responsible for the improved performance.

The test results obtained to date indicate that
the NaK condenser design is inadequate for ART

ZIRCONIUM FLUORIDE VAPOR TRAP
F. A. Anderson M. H. Cooper

High-temperature chemical absorbents and ther-
mal-precipitation traps are being investigated in

the program for the development of a zirconium

fluoride vapor trap. The most promising system
consists of a bed of hot aluming which reacts with

gaseous ZrF , to form solid ZrO, and AIF,. All

ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

the thermal-precipitation traps tested have formed
ZrF , plugs at the initial cold section.

The second test with an alumina bed, initicted
previously,24 was terminated after 450 hr of opero-
tion because of flow stoppage. X-ray diffraction
analysis of the packing showed that the Al,O,
had reacted with the ZrF , according to the follow-
ing equation:

3ZeF, + 2A1,0, —> 3210, + 4AIF,

Wet analysis of the packing showed that the reac-

tion was about 90% complete. The wet analysis

also showed that the plug was caused by thermal

precipitation of ZrF ,, in the cooled outlet section
of the test piece, ofter the Al,0, had been

depleted.

A shell-and-tube prototype trap2® was packed
with 4- to 8-mesh Al,O, pellets. The schematic
flowsheet for the test is shown in Fig. 1.4.16. -

Helium was bubbled through the sump containing
the fuel mixture (No. 30) NaF-ZrF -UF , (50-46-4
mole %) at 1500°F at o rate of 5000 liters/day and
exhausted through the trap, which was heated to
1350°F. This test, in which the fuel temperature
was 100°F higher than the temperature anticipated
in the ART, operated for 690 hr before ﬁig pres-
sure required to maintain the ART design flow
rate started to increase. Examination of the pack-
ing after termination of the test indicated that
the flow stoppage had been caused by thermal
precipitation of ZrF, after the Al O, had been
consumed.

The test of UF, pellets as a high-temperature
absorbent for ZrF, was unsuccessful. The ZrF,
was. not removed from the helium, and plugs of
thermally precipitated ZrF, were formed in the
outlet of the test piece. |

A thermal trap was modified by the addition of
four water-cooled baffles, as shown in Fig. 1.4.17.
Helium, ot the ART design flow rate of 5000
liters/day, was bubbled through the fuel (No. 30)
at 1400°F and passed through the trap. This test
was terminated after 231 hr as a resvit of a ZrF
plug, shown in Fig. 1.4.18, at the first baffle.

1.5. PROCUREMENT AND CONSTRUCTION
W. F. Boudreau

ART FACILITY
F. R. McQuilkin

Construction work on the contract portion of the
ART facility in Building 7503 is in the final
stages. Work on the building edditions, building
alterations, and cell installation (package 1) has
been completed, with the exception of installation
of the last six circuit breakers (which were delayed
by the Westinghouse strike) and completion of two
modifications to the cell floor structure (which
were ordered late in the contract period).

Work performed during the quarter included com-
pletion and testing of the cell; installation of
mechanical items, such as the penthouse coolers,
a 3-ton hoist, the air duct liner and insulation;
electrical testing; painting; grading and paving;
and miscellaneous cleanup jobs. The contractor
vacated his site office on July 20, 1936.

In order to ascertain the leck tightness of the
reactor cell, the 24-ft-dia tank was completely
assembled (with temporary test plates over all
nozzles) and subjected to a rigid leak test. Fol-
lowing a satisfactory pressure rise test of 50-hr
duration, the annulus between the two vessels was
flooded with 21,000 13 of circulating helium for
the leak-rate measurement, By using standerd
leaks of 14.7 and 28.24 micron ft3/hr on the sys-
tem, it was established that the two Model 24-102
Consolidated Engineering Company leak detectors
could detect a system leakage rate of 5 micren
f13/hr or larger. Inasmuch as a zero leak rate
was measured and the contract specification
allowed 32 micron f3/hr, the vessel satisfoctorily
met the leak tighiness requirements.

Work on the installation of auxiliary services
piping (package A) has been completed, with the

exception of replacement of 15 valves in the nitro-

gen system. Erroneous vendor information led to
the installation of incorrect vaives for the service.

They were rejected when pressure and leck testing -

revealed the error and their inadequacy. Other-
wise, work performed during the quarter included
completion and testing of the contractorsestablished

portions of the lube oil, hydraulic drive oif, cooling

water, gir, nitrogen, helium, ond vent piping
systems,

The work which includes the installation of the
diesel generators and facility, electrical control

64

centers, and spectrometer room electrical air con-
ditioning equipment (package 2) was at the 91.8%
completion point on September 1, 1956. All work
has been completed on this contract, with the ex-
ception of the installation and testing of the diesel
generators.  This work has been delayed because
one of the deisel-generator units and three control
panels were damaged in shipment, The damaged
components were returned to the manufacturer for
repair and are scheduled for reshipment early in
October 1956, Special vibration testing of the
units will be performed during the field tests to
ascertain that all damage has been accounted for.
Two other items of work were negotiated with the
package 2 contractor for execution while he com-
pletes his other work. The contractor was given
an order to remove the shield blocks now occupying
three sides of the ARE pit to nearby outside
storage so that this building space can be used.
To provide compliete access into the high bay
through the north door and to provide greater flexi-
bility in the use of the building cranes in unloading,
the contractor was also given an order to remove
the parapet wall above the floor level at an-eleva-
tion of 852 ft around the ARE pits. The roof plugs
for the pits will provide the floor surface over
them,

Design work continued and installation work was
started on package 3, which concerns the installa-
tion of process piping, process equipment, etc.
Completion of the design is currently scheduled for
October 1, 1956. During the quorter two of the

four main blowers were installed.

Some of the construction work may be seen in

Figs. 1.5.1 through 1.5.13.

Program and design planning for disassembly of
the ART were initiated. The problem is being
handled in two basic parts; the first being that of
removal of the reactor from the cell, and the second
that of transporting and disassembling it in hot-
cell facilities. Procedures and tools necessary
for removing the reactor are being developed. A
new, large hot-cell facility is being planned. It is
proposed that the new facility be constructed in
conjunction with the construction of a group of
smaller examination cells. The tentative location
of these cells is on the north side of the ORNL
Area adjacent to the Bethel Valley Road. Transfer

Construction work has started on the ETU facility.
Structural steel is being fobricated, and erection of
the stand from which the NaK pumps and piping
are to be supported has begun. The H. K. Furgerson

Company is procuring steel which will be installed
under the track floor to support the weight of the
stand. Designs for this work are complete. Design

of the control room enclosure is complete except
for minor details. -

The ‘details of the main NaK piping have been
determined, and piping layouts are being reviewed.
The economizers and the plug indicators for the
NaK cold-trap loops are being fabricated.

The design of the ait duct for the NaK-to-air
radiators is being reviewed. The air duct is to be
supported from the stand which supports the NaK
system. A variable-speed blower will send air
through the duct and across the radiators. The
air will be discharged outside the building.

A second layout of the piping for auxiliary
services has been completed. The auxiliary

services include instrument air, plant air, water, .

helium, lube oil, and hydraulic oil. Changes in
the system requirements have caused delays in

the start of construction of these systems. Neces-

sary changes have been made in the existing gas
pipingto the furnaces which will be used to provide
the heat load for the ETU.

The basic electrical system has been de.fugned |

A normal-supply substation of 1500-kva capacity
will be used, This power will be distributed by
means - of a 450-v switchgear unit, Individual
circuit breakers in this switchgear unit will supply

ART-ETU Reactor Fabrication and Assembly

R. Cordova C.K. McGlothlan

The study of the reactor assembly problem has

continued, and general assembly procedures have

been prepared and reviewed. A sequence of opera-
tions has been outlined which covers the assembly
of the reflector-moderator, nérth head, heat ex-
changers, island, and the various shells into a
complete reactor. Detailed instruction sheets are
being prepared from this general outline,. which
will serve as the assembly manual for the craftsmen
who will assemble the reactor. - 7

The more detailed review of the reactor assembly
problem has indicated the need for many jigs and
assembly fixtures, and design of such tools is
proceeding. A device for checking the concen-
tricity of the reflector-moderator components about
the polar axis during assembly has been designed.

“Weld ‘shrinkage tests on geometries pecuhor to
the reactor design are continuing (see Chap. 3.4,
“Welding ond Brazing - Investigations® ). It is

‘necessary that the weld shrinkage be predictable

to within a few thousandths of an inch if the close
tolerances designed into the reactor are to be held.

‘In-pile loop No. 5 was inserted in the MTR on
June 11, 1956, but it could not be filled. It was
therefore returned to ORNL for disassembly and
inspection. The fill system consisted of a fill
tank, a vent line, and a fill line to the pump sump.
In this system the fluid flows by gravity into the
preheated loop when a plug of frozen fuel mixture
is melted out of the fill line. Upon disassembly

‘and analysis a section of the fill line was found

to have ¢ plug formed of a 50-50 mixture of fuel
and zirconium oxide. Subsequent examination of
the initial batch of fuel showed it to contain 0.5%
zirconium oxide. It was also determined that
repeated melting and freezing of the fuel salt could
cause the zirconium oxide to separate out and
settle in the bottom of the fill tank; however, it

has not been possible to positively establish that

this was the mechanism of formation of the oxide
plug in the fill lines. Another consideration was
the possibility of accidental exposure of the
molten salt to moisture. However, the evacuation
and purging of the system with inert gas, which
were done prior to filling the tank, plus the evacu-

300°F temperature daf?erenhal across the nose

These conditions are to be maintained over two
MTR operating cycles to give approximately 700 hr
of operation with the reactor at full power.

ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

1.7. ADVANCED REACTOR DESIGN

W. K. Ergen

GRAPHITE AND BERYLLIUM OXIDE
MODERATED CIRCULATING-FLUORIDE-FUEL
REACTOR

W. K. Ergen

The complexities involved in the use of sodium

to cool the beryllium reflector-moderator of the

ART have directed thinking toward a reactor design
in which the moderator is cooled by the circulating
fuel. A new design now being studied is based

~ on a multitubular core, similar to that used for the
ARE,. in which fuel passages would penetrate o

moderator block or, altematively, moderator rods

‘would be immersed in the circulating fuel.

If the fuel is to accept heat from the moderator,

~ the moderator must be at o higher temperature than

the fuel. This eliminates  beryllium metal, as
used in the ART, from consideration! because of
its poor mechanical properties at temperatures
above the fuel temperature of interest, that is,
1600°F. Therefore graphite, beryllium oxide, and
the hydrides of zirconium and yttrium are being
considered as possible moderators.

The required volume of the multitubular reactor
core will, of course, depend largely on the desired
total reactor power and the permissible power
density in the fuel. A 24-in.-dia sphere has a
volume of 1.2 x 105 em3, and, if it is assumed,

optimistically, that 80% of this volume could be

occupied by fuel, about 105 cm? of fuel volume
would be available, Thus, in a 24-in.-dia multi-
tubular core, 100 Mw of power could be generated
with a power density of 1 kw/cm3, which is
approximately twice the average power density of
the ART, and 300 Mw would require 3 kw/cm3.
It is clear that in many cases of interest, therefore,
larger, rather than smaller, core volumes may be
necessary. Thus far, this study has been limited
to an evaluation of 24-in.-dia spherical cores, but
the general conclusions are applicable to larger
cores.

The rate of heat generation in the moderator and
the resulting thermal stresses would be of prime

 

Vit would, conceivably, be possible to use beryllium
in some reglons of the reactor, such as the cutside of
the reflector, and to cool these regions with the rela-
tively cold fuel coming from the heat exchanger.

importance. The gamma-ray heat sources? have
been shown to be prompt gamma rays plus U235
capture gamma rays (9 Mev), fission-frogment-decay
gamma rays (1 Mev, based on 20% of the fuel being
inside the core), gamma rays resulting from cap-
tures in material other than U235 (5 Mev, depending
strongly on the *‘thermal utilization” of the
reactor), and gamma rays resulting from inelastic
scatfering (1 Mev). This adds up to about 8% of

the fission energy. The density of the fuel was

considered to be 3.2 g/cm3, which is approximately
the density of the fuel mixture (No. 30) NaF-
ZrF -UF, (50-46-4 mole %), Hence, the radius
ussumed for the core would correspond to 2 or 3
reloxation lengths of the gamma rays, even if
aliowance were made for the moderator, which
would occupy some of the core and would have a
somewhat lower density than that of the fuel ‘Most
of the gamma rays generated at the center of the
core would be absorbed in the core. At points
closer to the surface, the power generotion by
gamma-ray absorption would be less.

The gamma-ray absorption would be distributed
between the fuel and the moderator approximately
according to the densities. In a volume filled to
80% by fuel of density 3.2 and to 20% by graphite
of density 1.8, the graphite would contribute about
'/ to the density. Beryllium oxide, of density
2 8, if it occupied the same volume fraction in
the saome fuel, would contribute about ¥ to the
density. With a heat generation rate in the fuel
of 1 kw/cm3 and a fuel volume fraction of 80%,
0.8 kw/cm® would be generated, on the average,
over the core; 8% of this, or 64 w/cm3, would be
gamma-ray energy, of which ‘é or 1’1'5 would be
absorbed in the moderator, depending on whether
the moderator is graphite or beryllium oxide. Since
the moderator would occupy Y% of the volume, the
power density in the graphite would be 40 w/cm?,
and, in the bery!lium oxide, 60 w/ecm3.

The heating as a result of neutron moderafion
should, of course, be added to the gamma-ray
heating. However, the neutron heating in the core
would depend strongly on the design of the reactor,
and, therefore, for the purpose of this discussion,
it has been assumed. that it is compensated by
the loss of gamma rays from the core. _

The permissible stress for graphite has been

assumed to -be 2000 psi, and, for beryllium oxide,4
1000 psi.

The stress data® and the power density
data given above were used to obtain the following
maximum dimensions for berylllum oxide and

graphite bodtes in the proposed mulhtubular core:

As may be seen, if beryllium oxide were used,
the structures in the core would have to be rather

. delicate. - Graphlte, on the other hand, would allow
rather rugged construction, in spite -of nuclear

considerations, such as self-shielding, which
would require o somewhat finer structure than that
indicated by the stress limitations. -Furthermore,
the cladding that would be required around be-

cross section of 10% of the macroscopic absorption
cross section of the fuel, both absorption cross
sections being averaged over the core. This
amount of poisoning is far in excess of that which
could be caused by the cladding of the graphite.
The results of the calculation indicated that there
would be no need from the criticality viewpoint
to use beryllium oxide in the core and that graphite
would be an acceptable moderator. Since the
reactor power and the permissible power density
prescribe a relatively large core volume, the

~ somewhat poorer moderating properties of the

graphite appear to be adequate.

~An_essentially infinite graphite reflector was
Because of
the relatively poor moderating properties of the

‘graphite, such a reflector would have to be rather

thick. Also, graphite has a relatively small macro-

‘scopic removal cross section for fast neutrons,

that is, 0.073 cm=1 compared with 0.14 cm=! for
beryllium oxide, 0.17 cm=1! for nicke! and copper,

~ and 0.096 cm~ for zirconium metal.® The small

removal cross section would result in large neutron
leakage and intense sodium activation in the heat
exchanger. On the other hand, the power density
in the reflector would be smaller than that in the
core, and there would be no need to use graphite.
An *‘essentially infinite'® beryllium oxide reflector
would be thinner than an ‘‘essentially infinite"’
graphite reflector, because of the lower age in
beryllium oxide, and in any geometry, except plane
geometry, the beryllium oxide reflector would give
greater reactivity because of the larger solid angle

~which the core would subtend, as viewed from the

their way back to the core and increase the re-

activity, but which, on the other hand, would also

leak out and increase the shielding requirements
and the sodium activation. Therefore it would
probably be advantageous to poison some of the
outer fuel passages, but the radius at which the
poisoning should start also has not yet been
- established. -

Both graphite and beryllium oxide are poor
gamma-ray shields. 1t may therefore be.advan-
tageous to introduce some heavy material into the
moderator, at the expense of reducing the moder-
ating effectiveness. The heavy material would
protect the outer layer from gamma-ray heating and

would make it possible to use beryllium oxide
rather than graphite farther into the core and thus

gain back the lost moderation.

 HYDRIDE-MODERATED CIRCULATING-FUEL
' "REACTOR '

A. M, Perry

An alternative design now being studied includes
the use of a somewhat more effective moderator
in the core, such as the hydrides of zirconium or
ytirium, than the graphite and beryllium oxide
moderators discussed above. The hydride moder-
ators would reduce the dependence of the reactor

on its reflector for moderation and would introduce
the possibility of using a heavy material, such
as nickel or .copper, for the reflector. These
materials have unusually large removal cross

sections for fast neutrons, as given above, and

are far more effective as gamma-ray absorbers
than the moderating materials usually used as
reflectors. Thus a significant portion of the
gamma-ray shield might be placed immediately
around the core, where its volume would be greatly

reduced. While the density of radiation heating’
in a metal reflector would be greater than in a

beryllium oxide reflector, the allowable stress
would be much greater also, so that fewer cooling
holes would be required for a nickel than for a
beryllium oxide reflector, In the case of copper,
the conductivity is so high that cooling might be
required only at the inner and outer surfaces of
an 8-in.-thick reflector.

Preliminary calculations indicate that a few

thousand pounds in shield weight might be saved

by using a dense metal reflector. The effect of
capture gamma rays in the reflector, as well as
the activation of NaK in the heat exchanger,
remain to be determined. Further calculations of
fuel concentrations in reactors with metal re-
flectors are also required.

2.1. PHASE EQUILIBRIUM STUDIES!

C. J. Barton

R. E. Moore

R. E. Thoma

H. Insley, Consultant

Phase equilibrium studies with a variety of
binary, ternary, and quaternary systems have been
continved. Each of the several methods described
in previous reports of this series has been applied
to several of the systems, Although earlier studies
in this laboratory and elsewhere did not disclose
its existence, careful examination of the LiF-RbF
system has revealed the compound LiF:RbF.
Careful re-examination of the LiF-UF , system has
yielded evidence which strongly indicates that the
compound 3LiF:UF, is metastable.

Study of the RbF-UF , system has progressed to
a point such that o tentative diagram for this
complex system can be presented. The boundary
curves, compatibility triangles, peritectic temper-
atures, and eutectic temperatures for the NaF-RbF-
UF, ternary system are now well established.
The four-component system NaF-RbF-ZrF +UF,
has been examined in some detail. Several mixtures
which are of possible interest for reactor fuels
have been established.

Study of the NaF-LiF-BeF , system has progressed
sufficiently for a plot of the boundary curves,
compatibility triangles, and pertinent temperatures
to be presented, although the composition of one
of the ternary compounds is not completely es-
tablished.  The ternary system NaF-RbF-BeF,
requires additional study before the analogous
diagram can be constructed.,

THE SYSTEM LiF-RbF
L. M. Bratcher

A recently published? equilibrium diagram for the
system LiF-CsF showed the existence of an
incongruently melting compound LiF.CsF that
was analogous to the binary compound previously
observed3 on petrographic examination of mixtures
containing LiF and RbF. Earlier thermal analysis

performed - by G. D. White, Metallurgy Division, and

examinations were performed by R. E. Thoma and

studies43 failed to reveal the existence of the
LiF-RbF compound. The system was re-examined
recently by the thermal analysis technique, and
selected compositions were examined petro-
graphically and by x-ray diffraction. A revised
equilibrium diagram for the system, based on the
results of these examinations, is shown in

‘Fig. 2.1.1. The shape of the liquidus curves gives

evidence of complex formation. However, the
difference between the melting point of the LiF-
LiF.RbF eutectic and the incongruent melting point
of the LiF-RbF compound (about 5°C) is less than
the uncertainty of the temperature measurements.
Petrographic examination of a mixture containing
50 mole % LiF showed that the birefringent
complex was the predominant phase present;
excess LiF and the complex were found in a
mixture containing 70 mole % LiF.

THE SYSTEM LiF-UF,

B. A. Soderberg R. E. Moore
H. Davis®

The discussion of the system LiF-UF which
was given previously,”’ mentioned a phase con-
taining 20 to 25 mole % UF, whose formula and
stability characteristics were unknown., Recently,
thermal gradient quenching studies were made in
an attempt to completely characterize this com-
pound,

The evidence from these and other quenched
samples from this system indicates that there is a
metastable compound in the LiF-UF, system
whose formula is 3LiF-UF,. In the quenched
samples the compound has the appearance of
quench growth. The crystals are sufficiently well
formed to give a good uniaxial-negative inter-
ference figure and a refractive index of approxi-
mately 1.514, but they have the characteristic
mottled texture and wavy extinction of quench

THE SYSTEM RbF-UF4

H. A. Friedman R. E. Moore

Quenching studies on the system RbF-UF, are
not complete, but considerable progress has
made. A tentative phase diagram, based on thermal
analysis studies and petrographic and x-ray dif-
fraction examinations of quenched and slowly
cooled samples, is presented in Fig. 2.1.2. The
formulas of RbF-UF4,' 2RbF-3UF‘, RbF-3UF4,
and RbF.6UF, were established on the basis of
nearly single-phase material that was found in
quenched samples of the corresponding compo-
sitions which had been equilibrated just below
the solidus temperatures. The recently obtained
thermal analysis data are given in Table 2.1.1,
and the results of quenching studies are presented

in Table 2.1.2.

An intensive study of the phase-equilibrium
characteristics of the system NaF-RbF-UF  has
been made. Equilibrium dota were derived from
petrographic and x-ray diffraction examination of

quenched ond slowly cooled melts. The boundary

| curves, compatibility triangles, and the peritectic
5 and eutectic temperatures characteristic of the

system are shown in Figs. 2.1.3 and 2.1 4. It
is noteworthy thot there is extensive solid so-
lution along the join 7NaF. 6UF4-7RbF-6UF
The extent of the miscibility gap is not yet de-
termined. This solid solution effecr is general
among the compounds 7MF-6UF ,, where MF is an
alkali fluoride. There is one ternary compound in
the system, with the formula NaFRbF-. UF ,. The
compound has a subsolidus existence at its compo-
sition below 530°C. The system contains the

The system NaF-RbF-ZrF +UF, offers several
mixtures which may be sohsfcctory fuels for a
cuculohng-fuel reactor.? Quenching studies of
this system were continued in order to establish
the primary phase fields of the uranium-containing
compounds.  Primary phase determinations were
also made on slowly cooled melts. These studies
provide a basis for indicating the potential fuel
mixtures from which the high-uranium-content
compounds might segregate.

The results shown in Figs. 2.1.5 and 2.1.6 are
for the ternary compositions NaF-RbF-ZrF, re-
calculated from the quaternary data. Where both
the primary and secondary phases contain uranium,

mixture is extremely corrosive; this may be due to
the presence of some sulfate in the CaF .. '
Examinations of slowly cooled melts by x-ray
diffraction and by the petrographic microscope
reveal a compound with a cubic structure, which is
presumably RbF.CaF, (ref 10). Since free CaF,
has been observed in mixtures containing 40 to
45 mole % CaF,, it seems likely that RbF -CoF,

melts incongruently.

L. M. Bratcher

Examinations of the systems LiF-CeF,, NaF-
CeF,, and RbF-CeF , were continued; however, the
data do not yet perrmt construction of satisfactory
equilibrium diagrams for these systems. Com-
parisons of data obtained with CeF; prepared at

ORNL with dats obtained - with commercially

prepared CeF , strongly suggest that the commercial
material contums a small amount of water. It

appears that treatment of the MF-CeF , mixture .

with NH HF, will suffice to eliminate difficulty
from this source. The NaF-CeF, system has been
shown to have a binary eutectic, which melts at
775 £ 10°C, between CeF, and a binary compound
believed to have the composition. NaF-CeF_s.

Study of the system CsF-BeF, was started .

recently in order to complete the study of the
alkali fluoride—beryllium fluoride systems and
to obtain additional data on the effect of varying
ion size on phase relationships. Thermal analysis
data have been obtained with mixtures at § mole %
intervals in the range 5 to 50 mole % BeF,, but
study of the slowly cooled melts is mcornpfefe.
There is a eutectic, presumably between CsF and
3CstBeF2, which melts at 605 + 5°C and con-
tains about 14 mole % Ber. Melting point re-
lationships of the compound 3CsF:BeF ., have not
been definitely established. The compound
2CsF-BeF , undoubtedly melts congruently, proba-

bly at a femperoture befow that of the analogous
compound 2RbF. BeF (800°C). As in the other
“alkali fluorlde-berylhum fluoride systems, liquidus

temperatures diminish rapidly in this system with
increasing BeF, content in the 33',5 to 50 mole %
BeF, region. The solidus temperature for mixtures
containing 35 to 45 mole % BeF, appears to be

about 450°C, which is very close to the repc;rfet:!I P

mcongruent meltmg point of RbF.BeF,,.

THE SYSTEM NaF-LiF-BeF,

R. E. Meadows

A dmgrom of the half of the system NaF-LiF-
BeF2 represented by the traungle NaF-LiF-
NaF.BeF_ was published recently.12 The quench-
ing study of the LiF-NaF.BeF,-BeF, triangle is
now sufficiently complete to permtt construchon of
a tentative diagram for the entire system, as shown
in Fig. 2.1.7. Binary eutectics, ternary eutectics,
and -peritectic points are indicated in the diagram,

along with the corresponding temperatures. Sub-

solidus compounds are shown in parentheses. The
temperatures following all the compound formulas
are the liquidus temperatures for congruently

'melhng compounds or the upper sfob|||ty limits

for other compounds. :

Difficulties in the petrographic identification of
the phases in the system, as mentioned previously,
are also present in the work on the LiF-NaF.BeF .-
BeF, portion of the system. Consequently it has
been necessary, in some cases, to prepare and
examine petrographically and by x-ray diffraction o
great many samples in order to obtain a single
result, _

Examination of slowly cooled samples, as well
as quenched ternary samples, shows that a ternary
compound containing more than 50 mole % BeF
exists in this system. Its identity has not been
completely established, but it is indicated on the

it may be an unreported binary compound has been
eliminated by x-ray diffraction examination of
equilibrated and quenched samples containing
66.7 mole % BeF,-33.3 mole % NaF and 66.7
mole % BeF2—33 3 mole % LiF.

The join 2LiF.-BeF o"2NaF.LiF.2BeF, was
established as a quasu-bmary system f:y the
examination of equilibrated and quenched samples
at 38 mole % BeF2—35 mole % LiF-27 mole %
NaF. The liquidus is 334°C and the primary
phase is 2LiF.BeF,. The phasesbelow the solidus
(315°C) are 2LiF- BeF ‘and 2NaF.LiF. 2BeF2 An

extrapolation places t 2he binary eutectic at 38.5

‘mole % BeF 2~30.5 mole % LiF-31 mole % NaF.
The join is not a true binary system because the
primary phase field of LiF overhangs the compound
2LiF-BeF, very slightly.13  The triangle LiF-
2LiF.BeF -2NaF «L.iF:2BeF, is a compatibility
triangle; no phases other than the three mentioned
have been found in samples within the triangle.

. Examinations of quenches of a composition con-

taining 50 mole % BeF2-38 mole % LiF-12 mole %
NaF, which is on the join 2LiF.BeF,-TC, show
that the liquidus is above 354°C ond that the
primary phase is 2LiF.BeF The solidus is
280°C, and the secondary ilase is the ternary
compound TC. The absence of a third phase
indicates that the composition is on or near the
binary system 2LiF.BeF -TC, At the composition
50 mole % BeF ,~12 mofe % LiF~38 mole % NaF
the liquidus is 344°C, and the primary phase is
NaF.BeF,. Below the solidus (280°C) the three
phases NaF-Ber,'ZLiF-Ber, and the ternary
phase TC coexist. At the composition 50 mole %
BeF ,~25 mole % LiF-25 mole % NaF the liquidus-
was found to be 276°C, with 2LiF. BeF, as the
primary phase.” The same three phases, NaF BeF2
2LiF.BeF,, and the ternary phase TC, were found
to be present below the solidus (271°C). The
results of these experiments show that _2LiF-_BeF2,'
NaF.BeF,, and the ternary phase TC form a com-
patibility triangle. However, the join 2LiF-BeF2-

" NaF.BeF is not a true binary system, even if the
~slight overhang of 2LiF.BeF, by the primary

phase field of LiF is disregarded. Quenching

 experiments with the composition 45 mole %

BeF2-20,mole % LiF~35 mole % NaF, which is on
the join, show that, down fo 300°C, 2LiF-BeF,

and 2NaoF.LiF 2BeF, are present.  Thus the
primary  phase fueld of 2NaF-.LiF 2Bef, cuts
across the join, There must be a pentecﬂc point
below 300°C in the triangle 2LiF. Ber-NaF Ber-
TC, where 2LiF. BeF,, 2NaF.LiF. 2Be|:2 NaF.BeF,
are in equilibrium, Locahons of the phase bounda-
ries, the peritectic point, and the ternary eutectic
were deduced from the evidence given above and

_are considered to be tentative.

THE SYSTEM No F-RbF-Ber

L. M. Bratcher

Study of the ternory system NaF-RbF- BeF, by
thermal analysis supplemented by petrographic and
x-ray examination of the slowly cooled melts was
continued. Cooling curves obtained with compo-
sitions within the triongle NaF-RbF-3RbF. BeF,,
prevuously reported to comprise a compahblllty
trlangle, indicated the existence of a ternary
eutectic having a melting point of approximately
625°C. Additional data will be required in order
to determine the eutectic composition, but the
available data show that it will be close to the
NaF-RbF eutectic (74 mole % RbF, melting point
675°C). An unidentified crystalline phase, believed
to be a ternary compound, has been observed in a
number of siowly cooled melts containing 45 to
60 mole % BeF,; this phase is usually associated
with an isotropic phase believed to be glass. The
cooling curves for the mixture NaF-RbF-BeF
(35-15-50 mole %)} showed only one thermal effect

‘at about 240°C, and the cooled melt was found to

be predominantly glass. The occurrence of glass
in ternary mixtures having BeF, concentrations
that produce only crystalline compounds in the
corresponding binary alkali fluoride—beryllium
fluoride systems was noted previously in the
NaF-KF-BeF, system.'5  This interesting phe-
nomenon may be due either to the difference in
ion sizes of the alkali ions involved or to the
lowering of solidus temperatures in the ternary
system to the point where the high viscosity of the
melt inhibits crystallization. Recent petrographic
and x-ray diffraction studies of slowly cooled
melts have confirmed the existence of the ternary
compound 2NaF-RbF-_BeF2; it also appears that

THE SYSTEM ‘KC'I-ZrCI‘
R. J. Sheil

Interest in zirconium chloride—~alkali chloride
systems stems from several sources. Low-melting-
point chloride systems are potentially useful
as heat transfer media. It is possible that fused-
salt systems containing Z:Cl, will be of interest
in the ZrCl, volatility method proposed for
processing o? metallic zirconium-uranium fuel
elements.'® [n addition it is of interest to com-
pare phase equilibrium behavior in these MCl-ZrCl
systems with behavior in the analogous MF-ZrF
systems, which have been thoroughly siudied at
ORNL.

The alkali chloride—zirconium chloride systems
have received relatively little attention. A
Russian investigation of the NaCl-ZrCl, system is
on record.'? Preliminary data obtained at ORNL
indicate serious errors in the published data; the
study being made here is not, however, sufficiently
complete to permit a diagram to be drawn.

Some data on the KCI-ZrCl, and NaCl- ZCl,
systems in the ZrC|4-r|ch parts of the systems
were obtained by investigators at Columbia Uni-
versity.18 The present investigation of the KCl-
ZrCl, system covers the composition range 10 to
75 mole % ZrCl4. The data obtained are in
reasonably good agreement with the Columbia data
in the limited area where the two investigations
overlap. The thermal analysis data obtained
from cooling curves with mixtures contained in
sealed glass, quartz, or nickel tubes fitted with
thermocouple wells ore shown in Fig. 2.1.8. In
addition to the use of the thermal analysis tech-
nique, visual observation and quenching techniques
were applied to the study of several mixtures in the

system, and most of the slowly cooled melts used
for thermal analysis were examined petrographi-
cally. As shown by Fig. 2.1.8, there is a eutectic
between KC! and the compound 2KCl.Z:Cl & which
melts congruently ot 790 + 5°C. The eutechc
melts at 600 1 5°C and contains about 23 mole %
ZrCl,. There is also another compound, tentatively
ass:gned the formula 7KCl.6ZrCl 4+ Which appears
to melt incongruently to give 2KCI.ZrCl . and
liquid at 565 + 5°C. The choice of the compound
formula was based partly upon thermal analysis
dota, which indicate thot the compound contains
less than 50 mole % ZrCl 4+ and partly upon the

“results of petrographic excmmahon of slowly

cooled and quenched samples in this region.
More careful study, particularly of quenched
samples, will be required to eliminate uncertainty
in regard to the compound composition. Thermal
effects on cooling curves at temperatures ranging
from about 218 to 225°C were noted with compo-
sitions containing more than 33'6 mole % ZrCl,.

Since this is reasonably close to the reportedi8
“melting point of the eutectic at 65 mole % ZrCl
(234.5°C), the appearance of the thermal effect
ot a temperature close to this value with compo-
sitions containing less than 50 mole % ZrCl
‘might be taken as an indication of incomplete
reaction of liquid with solid 2KC|-ZrC|4 at the
peritectic point. However, the magnitude of the
thermal effect on cooling curves, coupled with
the fact that no liquid was visible in mixtures
containing less than 50 mole % ZrCl, ot temper-
atures below 250°C, indicates the likelihood that
a solid phase transition occurs at a temperature so
close to the solidus temperature that the two
effects cannot be differentiated either by thermal
analysis or differential thermal anclysis. Petro-
graphic examination of a quenched sample con-
taining 55 mole % ZrCl, showed that, above 237°C,
well-crystallized phoses were present but that at
219°C and lower temperatures the samples con-
tained only microcrystalline aggregates.

It seems clear that uncertainties in analyses for

. to the surprising observations.

It has been observed thot NiF, dissolved in
NaF-ZrF, mixtures is stable in containers of
A-nicke! under continuous sparging with helium

- up to temperatures of 625°C. At temperatures

of 700°C ond above, .however, the concentration

The disappearance of NiF, from solution at the

‘higher temperatures is not well understood. The

presence of significant concentrations of reducing
impurities, such as hydrogen, methane, or oil
vapor on the helium, can apparently be eliminated
from consideration. The influent helium stream

can occur, it may be possible to explain the
phenomenon observed. No concrete evidence for
existence of this compound has been found..

A large number of equilibration measurements
have been ‘performed by using copper filtering
tubes. During the course of the sampling procedure
the copper filter tube becomes plated with nickel.
It has, accordingly, been necessary to determine
whether the concentration of nickel in solution is
changed by the introduction of the copper tube.
The results listed in Table 2.2.2, for samples

taken in the interval of 48 to 50 hr indicate that

nickel plating of the copper tubes does not change
the nickel concentration in solution. In addition,
a copper tube was immersed in the solution for
24 hr lmmedlately following the 48- to 50-hr period,
and a massive nickel deposit, which contained
large dendritic nickel crystals, was obtained
(Fig. '2.2.1). The weight of the deposit was
determined to be approximately 15 g; the weight
of nickel in solution just before immersion of the
copper tube was only about 0.4 g. The nickel
concentration of the solution immediately after
the heavy nickel plating occurred was determined
to be 960 ppm, as compared with a value of 1030
ppm obtained by averaging the results for all the
'samples taken during the 48- to 50-hr period.

The formation of a nickel plate on the copper |

tubing could be explained by simple concentration
cell action; however, such a mechanism would

98

cease to function after a very thin film of nickel .

was laid down unless a copper-nickel alloy were
formed.  Careful examination of the massive
deposit- shown in Fig. 2.2.1 revealed essentially

force for this plating process were the temperature
difference between the nickel reactor wall and
copper tube, which was cooled by influent helium
gas, similar deposits of nickel should have ap-
peared on the nickel sampling tubes, but no such
deposits have ever been observed. In all these
experiments the copper tubing was inserted through
a stainless steel Swagelok fitting at the top of
the reactor, where the temperature was about
200°C.  Accordingly a low-temperature copper-
steel-nickel junction was in electrical contact in
series with a high-temperature copper-nickel
junction through the molten salt. It appears
likely that the resulting thermoelectric potential
may have been the driving force for the plating
process. Although experiments are planned to
supply explanations for some of these phenomena,
it can be concluded that the use of copper filters
introduces no significant error into the results
presented.

In an effort to obtain concrete evidence for the
formation of ‘a volatile nickel subfluoride, two
platinum crucibles were loaded with known weights
of nickel fluoride and three nickel crucibles were
charged with mixtuwes of metallic nickel powder

ACTIVITY OF CHROMIUM
‘IN CHROMIUM-NICKEL ALLOYS

M. B. Panish

The determlnatnon of the activity of chromium
in chromium-nickel alloys has been completed
with the use of the electrode concentration cells
and the techniques previously described.34 The
values obtained for the activity of chromium in
various chromium-nickel alloys at 750 and 965°C
during this investigation are shown in Fig., 2.2.2.
The curve obtained by Grube and Flad> at 1100°C
is shown for comparison. From these data it
appears that at concentrations below about 25 at. %

the activity of chromium is somewhat lower than

its atomic fraction in the alloy.

The curve obtained at 750°C in this investigation
is consistent with the expected behavior of a
system which has an immiscibility gap. However,
both the Grube and Flad curve and the data ob-
tained at 965°C in this investigation seem to yield
implausibly fow chromium activities for the
chromium-rich solid sclutions.

SOLUBILITY AND STABILITY OF STRUCTURAL ,

METAL FLUORIDES IN VARIOUS
FLUORIDE MIXTURES

J. D. Redman

Data gathered from studies on the stability and
solubility of CrF,, FeF,, and NiF, in NoF-ZrF
(53-47 mole %) at 600 and 800°C were reported
previously.®  The results obtained at 600°C
demonstrated that the solubility of the structural
metal fluoride was a function of the excess of
structural metal fluoride present. It is believed
that the change in solubility is caused by the
presence of a solid phase, probably MF2-ZrF4, and
the resulting change of the NaF concentration in
the melt. The studies have been extended to
include the solvents LlF-ZrF (52-48 mole %),
NaF-ZrF (59-41 mole %), ond KF-ZrF (52-48
mole %), anci additional studies have been mcde on
the solubility of C!'l"'3 in the NaF-LiF<KF eutectic.

Data for the solubility of CrF, at 600°C in the
three additional solvents mentloned above, as
presented in Tables 2.2.4, 2.2.5, and 2.2.6, show
that the solubility varies markedly with the solvent

employed. The solubility in NaF-ZrF, (59-41
mole %), as shown in Table 2.2.5, is higher than
that previously found for NaF-ZrF 4 (53-47 mole %)
and substantiates the belief that the solubility
increases with increasing NaF concentrations.
Only in the case of LiF-ZrF, was a sufficient
excess of CrF2 present to affect the zirconium-to-
alkali ratio. An examination of Table 2.2.4 reveals
a decrease. in this ratio os the excess of CrF

present increases. The solute is too soluble at
800°C in all the solvents studied to show any
similar effect, if indeed it does exist. Divalent
chromium appears to be the stable valence state
in these solvents, although there is some indication
that a smaller fraction of the chromium is present
as Ce** in the LiF-ZrF , mixture than in the other
two solvents.

Comparable data for the solubility of FeF
in these solvents are presented in Tables 2.2.7
and 2.2.8. It may be seen that in all tests at
600°C the solubility increased with excess FeF,
present and that the zirconium-to-sodium ratios
tended to decrease with increasing excess FeF‘.2
The solubility of FeF, at 600°C is higher in the
NaF-ZrF , mixture than in either the LiF-ZrF,
mixture or the KF-ZrF, mixture. However, if the
solubility in these two solvents is compared with
the solubility in NaF-ZrF (53-47 mole %), it will
be found that with 1 wt% FeF added the solubility
in the NaF-ZrF , mixture is |ower than in any of the

102

others and that for a 5 wt % addition all three give
essentially the same values. The increase of the
NaF content in the NaF-ZrF, mixtures causes an
increase in the solubility of FeF, which is most
pronounced at the lower iron concenfrat:ons. The
data indicate that divalency is the stable form of
iron in these solvents, There is a slight indication
that Fe** is not so stable in NaF-ZtF, (59-41
mole %) as in the other solvents studied, mcludmg
NaF-ZrF , (53-47 mole %).

Comparable data on the solubility of NiF,
these solvents are presented in Tables 2 2 9,
2.2.10, and 2.2.11. From the data it is apparent
that the solubility of NiF, in NaF-Z:F, and
KF-ZrF, is nearly the same and independent of
the amount of NiF, added. However, the solubility
of NiF, in the LiF-ZrF, mixture is a function of
the amount of NiF, added at both 600 and 800°C.
Values found previously - in NaF-ZrF,  (53-47
mole %) are quite similar to those found for the
LiF-ZrF, mixture and smaller than those given
for NaFZZeF, (59-41 mole %) at 600°C with 1.5
wt % NiF, additions, but they are essentially
equal with 5 wt % NiF, present.

LiF-BeF, (48-52 mole %) have been studied as the
reaction media.

Preliminary data for the reaction of UF, with
Cr® at 600 and 800°C in the solvent Rblé-ZrF 4
(60-40 mole %) are given in Table 2.2.13. Ap-
proximately 2 g of Cr% was reacted with UF,
(9.2 wt %, 4.0 mole %) dissolved in apprommateiy
40 g of the RbF-ZrF , mixture contained in nickel
in these tests, Slm:1ar studies with Fe? in place
of Cr® yielded the results reported in Table 2.2.14.

The 800°C data shown in Table 2.2.13 are not

satisfactorily precise. However, .it appears that

- the ‘equilibrium chromium concentrations existing
. in the RbF-ZrF, mixture are lower than those
- i,noted in any of the other alkali ﬂuorlde—ZrF‘

mixtures studied. The lowest values found previ-
: ously were those measured in the KF-ZrF 4 (52-48

mole %) mixture, where roughly- 1000 ppm of

" chromium was found at both 600 and 800°C. Valuves
for other mixtures are: Li F-ZrF (52-48 mole %),
12900 and 3900 ppm at 600 and 800°C respechvely,
NaF-ZrF 4
600 and 800°C, respectively.:

(53-47 mole %), 1700 and 2100 ppm at .
Thus it appears
that the fluoride ion activity, as measured by the
equilibrium chromium concentration, decreased,

mixtures containing Rb, K, Na, and Li.

The data presented in Table 2.2.14 suggest that
equnhbnurﬁ for the Fe%-UF, system is attained
rather slowly in RbF-ZrF 4+ and, although it is
believed that equilibrium was attained after 5 hr
of heating, longer periods will be studied to
establish this point. If it is assumed that the
values for the 5-hr heating period are equilibrium
values, a comparison of these with the iron values
obtained for the other alkali fluoride—ZrF , mixtures
shows that the iron concentrations at both temper-
atures studied are virtually independent of the
reaction medium used and in all cases are higher

contrast to that observed for the Cr%UF 4 System,
which exhibits a marked dependence on the re-
action medium employed No satisfactory expla-
nation can be offered for this indifference of the
Fe -UF system toward changing fluoride ion
actsvmes.

Studies were also made of the reaction of Cr?
with UF, in molten LiF- BeF, (48-52 mole %).
The data are reported in Table 2.2.15. 1In these
tests approximately 2 g of Cr® was reacted with
UF, (1.5 wt %, 1.5 mole %) dissolved in approxi-
mately 30 g of the LiF-BeF, mixture contained in
nickel. The data presented in Table 2.2.15 show
that the Cr -UF system is strongly temperature
dependent over 1he range studied, and consequently
the attack by UF, on chromium-containing alloys
in this system might be expected to be serious.
The only solvent previously studied with which a
comparison can be made is LlF-ZrF (52-48
mole %). This mixture yielded chromwm values

of 2900 and 3900 ppm at 600 and 800°C, values

which are considerably higher than those reported

for the LiF-BeF, mixture.

. Several experlments were performed in which

800°C. In the case of the CrF, addition, all the

chromium was soluble and at least 80% of it was

all the chromium was soluble, but only about 20%
was reduced to Cr** by interaction with the nickel
container. A fair balance was observed between
the quantities of Cr** and Ni** formed. It appears
that Cr** is the stable valence state for chromium
in the LiF-BeF, mixture and that Cr*** is reduced
to Cr** by nickel in this solvent. This behavior
is in agreement with that noted for chromium in the
various aikali fluoride-ZrF4 mixtures studied.

The solubilities of FeF’2 CrF,, and NiF,, as
well as those of the corresponding fluorozrrconate
complexes (MF ,-ZrF ), were determined in an
effort to find a quasi binary. As can be seen in
Fig. 2.2.3, there is no detectable difference in
solubility between each metal fluoride and its
cotrresponding fluorozirconate, except for chromium,
and even for chromium the difference is small and
may be due to experimental error. This means that
the liquidus temperatures along the two joins
(MF ,-7NaF-6ZrF, ond MF,.-ZrF 7NaF.6Z¢F )
in tﬁ ternary phase diagram are almost the same.
The most recent evidence from quenched prepa-
rations suggests that only in the case of FeF
is FeF,-ZrF, the saturating phase and that a
solid ternary phase is precipitated in the other
systems.

Similar concentration cefls containing CuF,
(with copper crucibles and electrodes) have
frequently yielded indeterminate results. Although
CuF, in the presence of metallic copper in NaF-
ZrF melts might be expected to reduce com-
pletely to CuF, the cells have behaved as though

108

both CuF and Cqu were present, with the mono-
valent salt predominating at higher temperatures.

A vessel fabricated of boron nitride (obtained
from the Carborundum Co.) was charged with an
NaF«KF-LiF (eutectic) mixture and heated for
three days at temperatures from 550 to 770°C in a
helium atmosphere. The resistance between a
nickel wire immersed in the melt and the metal
platform supporting the crucible remained high
(107 ohms at 650°C, 4 x 10# ochms at 770°C) and
was reproducible during the run. Examination of a
cross section of the cooled container revealed
penetration by the melt of about l/ in.,- but no
petrographic evidence of contammaﬂon of the
melt wos found. Further tests will be made to
study the stability of this ceramic to fused
fluorides.

ACTIVITIES IN THE RI.':I"'-ZI'F4 SYSTEM
S. Cantor S. D. Christian

The vapor pressure data previously reported?!?
for the RbF-ZrF, and the KF-ZrF, systems have
been processed to yield some information on how
the activities change with the concentration and
temperature. Since ZrF , was found to be the only
volatile constituent, the activities of ZrF, based
on liquid standard states were obtained from the
appropriate log p vs 1/T equation, presented
previously,'2 by calculating the pressure at a
given temperature and dividing by the pressure of
pure, liquid ZrF .

The only value available for the vapor pressure
of pure, liquid ZrF, was obtained at the melting
point, 912°C. To obtain vapor pressures for pure,
liquid ZrF at lower temperatures the following
relation was used:

P, AH, /1
log — = —_ -1,
P, 230R (Tm T)

 

where
AH_ = heat of melting in cal/mole,
T, = melting point in degrees Kelvin,
P_ = sublimation pressure,
P, = supercooled liquid wvapor pressure,

R = gas constant.
If a tentatively estimated value of 13.5 keal/mole
is adopted for the heat of fusion of ZrF ,, P, for

ZrF4 is found to be 2.64, 25.9, and 164 mm at
600, 700, and 800°C, respectively. At 912°C
the vapor pressure of pure ZrF, is 905 mm. A

of RbF in ZrF, at various temperatures is shown
in Fig. 2.2.4, and the activities of ZrF, obtained
from these values are given in Table 2.2.16.

A curve-fitting process showed that the activities

As a consequence of strong complexing, the

activities decrecse extremely rapidly with compo-
sition. Activities of KF are very slightly higher
than the activities of RbF at corresponding compo-
sitions and temperatures, since the larger rubidium
ion has less affinity for the fluoride and RbF is
therefore a better complexing agent than KF.

An interesting comparison is found in the plot
of aZrF in alkali fluoride solutions against ionic

radius of the alkali metal. If the activity of
ZrF, is arbitrarily chosen as that ot 50 mole %,
the plot shown in Fig. 2.2.8 is obtained at 912°C.
The ZrF | activity decreases with increasing ionic
radius o? the alkali cation. The activities in
LiF-ZrF , {ref 13) and NaF-ZrF (ref 14) solutions
were obtcmed by dividing the vapor pressure of the

solution by 905 mm, the vapor pressure for pure

SOLUBILITY OF LeF, AND OF CeF, IN
MOLTEN FLUORIDE MIXTURES

W. T. Ward

A systematic investigation of solubilities of
some rare-earth fluorides in ART-type fuels was
initiated. Two introductory experiments related
to this investigation were reported previously.}5¢16
Cost and availability considerations indicated
lanthanum and cerivm fluorides to be logical
starting materials for the investigation. Mixtures
considered to be the least difficult from the stand-
point of chemical analysis were  investigated
first. The solvents NaF-KF-LiF (11.5-42-46.5
mole %) and NaF-ZrF (50-50 mole %) have been

results of several experiments are summerized in
Tables 2.2.18 through 2.2.21. _

The results presented in Table 2.2.18 indicate
that the solubility of CeF, in the NaF-KF-LiF
eutectic mixture is at least 6§ wt % at 500°C.
When the survey of other ART fuels is completed
this experiment will be repeated with greater
additions of CeF,. The dota in Table 2.2.19
indicate that the solubility of LaF, in the NaF-
KF-LiF eutectic mixture is at least 12.0 wt %

- (4.12 mole %) at 500°C. Petrographic and x-ray

diffraction examination of the second 800°C

filtrate revealed traces of KLaF 4 The NalaF 4
compound was not detected.

The data in Table 2.2.20 indicate that, within
the apparent analytical -precision, the solubility
of CeF 3in NaF-ZrF 4 (50-50 mole %) is independent
of the amount of CeF, added. Petrographic and
x-ray examination of the reactor heel revealed
relatively large quantities of pure CeF,, and only
traces of an unidentified phase that exhibited high
birefringence.  Free CeF, was present in the

800°C filtrates.

SOLUBILITY OF XENON IN FUSED SALTS
R. F. Newton

The components of apparatus for the determi-
nation of the solubility of xenon in fused salts
have been constructed and assembly is nearly
complete. The radioactive isotope Xel33 is to
be used for these studies. Saturation will be
accomplished in a slowly rocking, nearly hori-
zontal, tube about half full of melt. Small samples
of the saturated melt will then be counted with a
scintillation counter.  The sensitivity of the
counter is such that a solubility of 10~7 mole/cm®
should be determinable to within perhaps 20%,
and a solubility as low as 10=1° mole/cm3 can
probably be detected.

Xenon-133 is particularly suitable for this de-
termination because it decays to a stable daughter,
Cs 33, and hence the results will not be falsified
by the counting of o radiocactive daughter which
is. readily soluble in the melt. The xenon is
readily obtainable in quantities more than suf-
ficient for the purpose from the waste gas from

the recovery of iodine from spent fuel slugs.

MOLTEN SALT POLAROGRAPHY

then it increased.rapidly, probably because of the

Apparently - the dissolved FeF, was so highly
complexed that reaction could not occur in spite
of the favorable free energy, but the presence of
excess FeF, changed the situation. Saturation
occurred at 0.19 wt % FeF,.

Much time was devoted to an unsuccessful

ACTIVITIES FROM EMF MEASUREMENTS
- ON SOLID SOLUTIONS OF SALTS

M. B. Panish

Measurements of activities in the system AgCl-
NaCl by an emf method have been of interest both
as a trial study with a solid elecfrolyte of o
technique which may be applicable ‘to fluoride
systems and also as o demonstration of some
metastable solid solution behavior. The cell being
investigated was comprised of ‘Agf% and CI'J
electrodes, with AgCi-NaCl as the elecfrolyte,
so that the cell reaction was the formation of
AgCl from the elements. The activity of AgCl
was determined from the emf by comparison with
pure AgCl. The eiectrolyte concentration was
varied from 3 mole % to pure AgCl, and the temper-
ature range was extended from the liquid into the

solid region, that is, to temperatures as low as

250°C.

- The feasibility of makmg equulsbrlum mecsure--_'
ments with a solid electrolyte, as reported by
. earlier workers,’? 'was demonstrated. This is

probably easier’ with the Ag* ion.in a chloride
system, but, with a_ svitable amplifier, measure-
ments on solid fluorides might also be feasible.
If so;, a ceramic container’ would no longer be.a

problem for cells containing fluorides, measure-
ments could be made on solids by using cells
- designed to cvord ‘transference potentials, and
- compositions - with™ mconvenlently hlgh meltmg

pomts could be studied.”
“In the liquid state, the AgCI-NcCI system ‘showed

a slight posifive deviafion from’ ideality. From the

phase dragrum, a continuous series of solid so-

Jutions was expected below the solidus. However,
the activity of AgCl in the solid so!uhon was not
a monotonic function of concentration, The AgCl-

-tration curve which rose well above, and pre-

sumably did not connect with, the curve for NaCl-

showed - a.slight pegative deviation, 'if any, from
Raoult’s law. There was apparently a region in the
middle where the two curves overlapped without

_ ‘cbrmecﬁng, however, the ‘experimental uncertainty
_in this region was large. Obviously the solution

wrfh the higher AgCl activity was unstable with
respect to the lower one, but no transition from

‘the higher curve to the lower was noted. Also an

achwty-concenfraﬂon relcmon of thls type requires

‘that * the 'stable condition is separation into
‘c.oniugate solutions; no evidence of such phase

separation was found by petrographic or x-ray

fe_xaminotions.' The \m‘etostable_' condition was
- praduced by quenching from the liquid and was

maintained, in spite ‘of annealing, because of the
slowness of diffusion in the solid. These findings

“agree qualitatively with those found for the

same solid solution by Wachter,1? who worked at a

lower temperature and used different electrodes.

SURFACE TENSION AND DENSITY
OF NaF-ZrF, MIXTURES.

F. W. Miles

Attempts to apply the maximum bubble-pressure
method! to determinations of surface tensions of
NaF-ZrF mixtures have been accompanied by
dlfﬁculﬂes caused by partial plugging of the
capillary tips. Therefore the values that have
been obtained are not considered to be sufficiently
accurate to report. Additional equipment is being
added to the gas-purification train, and the bubble-
pressure apparutus is being simplified in an effort
fo minimize contamination of the system and
consequent pluggmg of the tips.

The results of several densuty determmutlons
on NaF-ZrF (53-47 mole %) are now available.
The density data (in g/ml) are summarized below:

where T is temperature in °C.

The data were obtained on several different
batches of NaF-ZrF mixture of the same compo-
sition. |t is believed, however, that the density
values are probably correct to within 2%. The
calculated densities? corresponding to this compo-
sition are higher by approximately 5% than the

SURFACE TENSIONS OF MOLTEN SALTS
S. Langer
Flucrozirconate Mixtures

Additional measurements of the surface tensions
of NaF-ZrF, (53-47 mole %) mixtures have been
made by USmg the sessile-drop technique, pre-
viously described.3+4  Recent experiments at
600°C tend to substantiate the results reported

previously. Some data have been obtained.at

700°C, and o preliminary experiment at 800°C
has been run. The data accumulated to date are
summarized in Table 2.3.1. Data from the previous
report4 are included and corrected by the use of
more precise densities calculated from the equation

d = 3.651 - (1.04 x 10-3) T(°C) ,

reported above.

The “‘best’’ values for the surface tension of
these mixtures are 127 * 6 dynes/cm at 600°C
and 119 t 4 dynes/cm at 700°C, where the error
range is the root-mean-square deviation. It should
be noted that there appears to be a small difference
(within experimental error) between the data
obtained in helium and in hydrogen atmospheres at
600°C. The average surface tension in helium is
128 dynes/cm, while the average in hydrogen is
122 dynes/cm. More experimental work will be
needed to demonstrate the effect of the atmosphere.

The first evidence of a large change of surface
tension with composition is shown by the data
at 800°C. The large loss of weight due to vapori-
zation of ZrF‘ from the sessile drop and the
concomitant change of composition probably ex-
plain the increase in the surface tension of the
melt. Experiments designed to study the effects
of change of composition as a function of temper-
ature, pressure of the confining gas, and time of

equilibration are under way. The results will

ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

2.4, PRODUCTION OF PURiFIEDM FLUORIDE MIXTURES

G. J. Nessle
LABORATORY-SCALE PURIFICATION
OPERATIONS
W. T. Ward

The standard hydroflucrination-hydrogenation
process was used, with appropriate meodifications
to laboratory-scale equipment, to prepare a number
of especially pure flucride mixtures requested for
various' reseurch programs, Several of these
compositions were dispensed directly into con-
tainers furnished by the requester to minimize
atmospheric-contamination and handling.

QUALITY CONTROL OF RAW MATERIALS
AND PRODUCTS

W. T. Ward

. The processing characteristics of an NaF-ZrF
mixture supplied by a commercial vendor were
determined, and the product was found to meet
specifications. Samples of all production batches
were obtained for petrographic and x-ray diffraction
analysis to assure quality control.

PILOT-SCALE PURIFICATION OPERATIONS

C. R. Croft J. Truitt
J. P. Blakely

The pllot-scoie purification facility processed
53 batches totaling 835 Ib of various fluoride
compositions for use in smallsscale corrosion
testing, phase equilibrivm studies, and physical
property studies. The demand for special compo-
sitions continved at a fairly constant level, and
thus efficient operation and maintenance of these
facilities at about 30% capacity was possuble
without accumulatmg a backloeg.

The use of copper-lined stainless steel reactor
vessels in these small size units has proved
successful in all but one case. Mixtures con-
taining NaF, LiF, KF, and UF cannot be frozen
in the copper liners and then remelted In three
attempts to process NaF-KF-LiF- UF (11.2-41-
45.32.5 mole %) the copper liners ruptured when
the melt was frozen and then remelted in the
reactor vessel. This means that any full-scale
operation of the 250-1b facility for the preparation
of such mixtures would necessitate a 24-hr-day
7-day-week basis of operation so that the mixture
could be maintained molten at all times.

PRODUCTION-SCALE OPERATIONS
J. E. Eorgan J. P. Blakely

The production-scale facility processed 19
batches totaling about 4550 1b of purified fluoride
melts. The use of copper-lined stainless steel
reactor vessels continued to prove very satis-
factory in this facility. One reactor vessel has
now produced sixteen 250-Ib batches, and it. shows

" no signs of deterioration. Product quality has

remained excellent throughout the equipment life;
however, some difficulties have been encountered
because of the high oxygen and water content of

the poor-grade hydrogen now being supplied in

this area. This difficulty has apparently been
overcome by installation of catalyst trains and

- cold traps of higher capacity than previously used

on the hydrogen purification system,

The production facility was shut down during
July because the relatively low consumption rate
resulted in a shortage of receivers for storage of
purified product. The present disposition of sixty-
four 250-Ib containers is the following: -

Forty new 250-1b storage containers are presently
on order. Delivery of these containers is expected
to begin in September, and reactivation of the
production facility is scheduled accordingly. It
is extremely unlikely, however, that the shortage
of such containers will be alleviated before
January. Accordingly production of purified ma-
terials will probably be 8,000 to 10,000 Ib behind
presently scheduled demands by the end of this
calendar year.

An order for 30,000 Ib of NeZrF, has been
placed with a commercial vendor. It is estimated
that this amount should be sufficient to maintain
operation for FY 1957. Delivery of 4000 lb of
this material per month is expected to begin in

August 1956. Each shipment will be analyzed
thoroughly to ascertain that specifications of purity
have been met. : '

BATCHING AND DISPENSING OPERATIONS
F. A. Doss - J. P. Blakely
The batching and dispensing facility dispensed
128 batches totaling approximately 8025 Ib of
processed fluorides in batch sizes ranging from

-1 to 250 Ib.. This is a sizeable increase over the

amount normally handled because of large ship-

~ments to Pratt & Whitney. As a result, the stock
inventory of processed fluorides decreased ap-

preciably. A material balonce for the quarter is

PREPARATION OF ZrF‘ FROM Zl'(:l4
J. E. Eorgan J. P. Blakely

A dust filter for the ZrCl -conversion unit is
presently being installed. tonversion of some
2000 Ib of low-hafnium ZrCI4 to ZrF, will begin
as soon as installation of the filter is complete.
It is hoped that the new dust filter will prevent
large-scale loss of the product during the con-
version and permit efficient operation. The con-
version unit will be operated on a 24-hour-day
five-day-week basis until the present supply of

~ZrCl, is all converted to ZrF,. The recent

demand for 1200 Ib of low-hafium NaF-ZrF,
(50-50 mole %) for the Pratt & Whitney high-
temperature critical test has made it imperative
that this unit be operated as soon as possible.

In order to meet known demands in FY 1957 for
fluoride compositions requiring low-hafnium ZrF ,
an order for 7000 Ib of low-hafnium ZrCI4 has
recently been initiated. At least half this order
has been requested for delivery before December
1956, and the remainder is to be delivered some-

time in the last half of FY 1957.

Special Enriched Fuel for In-Pile Loops

Inpile loop No. 5 failed to operate at the MTR
because of inability to move the fuel from the sump
tank to the pump (see Chap. 1.6, ‘““‘In-Pile Loop
Development and Tests"). Later investigations
showed that the fill line between the pump and
the sump tank was plugged. This plug was found
to be nearly 50% ZrO s and subsequent analysis
of the original batch showed evidence of oxides
and oxyfluorides. Examination of two other unused
batches showed oxides and oxyfluorides to be
present in undesirable quantities. As a result
- of these findings, a new batch of the fuel mixture
(No. 44) NoF-ZtF, -UF, (53.5-40-6.5 mole %) was
processed with extreme care for use in in-pile
loop No. 6. The batren carrier was prepared and
processed first to determine whether oxides of
zirconium were persisting in the batch. Since
the carrier was found to be oxide-free, the U235.
enriched UF, was added to the batch, and the
processing was repeated. When the batch was
shown fo be oxide-free, a fuel charge was trans-
ferred from the batch into a loading can. A sample
was token during this operation to reverify the
oxide purity of the charge. The charge was then
loaded into the loop, with a sample being taken
as the charge moved from the loading can into
the loop. This sample was also verified as being
oxide-free. Therefore, it can be assumed that
the charge that went into the sump tank of in-pile
loop No. 6 was in satisfactory condition.

Spectrographic anclysis of the plug in the fill
line of in-pile loop No. 5 revealed sufficient
amounts of foreign impurities, such as aluminum,
silicon, calcium, and zinc, for there to be
reasonable doubt as to whether the oxide content
of the original charge was the actual cause of the
plug formation. However, to remove at least one
uncertainty in future loop operation, extreme care
will be taken to assure the delivery of pure
material into the loop sump tanks.

Shield Mockup Core Materials

Fabrication of two *‘orange slices’ which simu-
late sections of the SMC has been completed (see
Chap. 5.4, “*Shield Mockup Core’). Attempts will

122

be made to pour into these sections the molten
salt NaF-ZrF -UF ,-KF (61.7-16.4-1.4-20.5 mole %),
which wiil be used to simulate the fuel and NaK
coolant in the heat exchanger region. Critical
measurements of the ‘‘orange slices’ have been
made and any changes in these dimensions as a
result of the pouring operation will be noted. One
section is fabricated from l/‘-ln type 310 stainless
steel plate and the other from é-m type 310
stainless steel plate. After pouring and cooling,
the **orange slices’ will be sectioned thoroughly
to determine the possibility of void formation in
the frozen salt and whether any segregation of
the uranium occurred in the freezing process,

EXPERIMENTAL PREPARATION OF VARIOUS
FLUORIDES

B. J. Sturm L. G. Overholser

Additional quantities of the several structural
metal fluorides have been prepared by the methods
employed previously. Increasing interest in the
use of rare-earth fluorides for various experimental
purposes required the preparation of several such
fluorides in substantial quantities. Continuved use
has been made of chemical, x-ray, and petrographic
examinations to establish the identity and purity
of the products.

Several batches of CrF, were prepared by
hydrogen reduction of (NH4)3CrF6, and additional
N:F was obtained by hydroflucrination of NiCl,.
Three pounds of K,FeF, was synthesized from
aqueous solutions of FeCf and KF. Four pounds
of CeF; was prepared by the interaction of an
aqueous HF solution with Ce,(CO,),, followed
by washing and drying. A small batch of YF,
was prepared in a similar manner, with YCI, bemg
used as the starting material. Approximately
‘é Ib of NdF, was synthesized from Nd,(CO,)

by using an aqueous HF solution. Also a smaﬂ'

batch of PrF_ was prepared by the same general
method by starting with PrCl,. A small quantity
of K,TeF, was synthesized by the addition of
aqueous K% to an aqueous mixture of TeO, and
HF. A sample of CaF, was treated wiﬂ'\'NH‘F HF
and ignited at 1125°C. A somple of K, ZrF was
freed of oxide by hydrofluorination at 780°C
Recently, work was started on the preparation of
molybdenum fluorides by using the reduction of
MoF and separation of the reduction products by
condensatlon at various temperatures.

PENETRATION OF GRAPHITE BY
MOLTEN FLUORIDES

H. J. Buttram - G. F. Schenck!
The study of the behavior of graphite exposed to

molten fluoride fuel mixtures was continved. Pre-

viously reported preliminary results? showed that
APC graphite was completely penetrated by NaF-
ZrF, (53-47 mole %) in 1 hr ot 600°C, while
NaF-ZrF 4-UF, (53.5-40-6.5 mole %) had not de-
tectably penetrated the .graphite after 10 hr. In an
attempt to investigate this behavior more thoroughly,
an alpha counter was employed to follow the dif-
fusion of the urdnium-fluoride-confaining mixture
into the graphite. After exposure of 1’ X / x ¥ in,
graphite specimens to the fluoride mlxture at 606°C
counts were taken on various samples obtained by
filing and scraping the surfaces in @ .uniform
manner, ' : R

The petrographic microscope was used for the
examination of samples, as in the previously
described experiment,? and it was found that after
10 hr of exposure to NaF-ZrF .UF, (53.5-40-6.5
mole %) there was no evidence of penetrahon into
the graphite specimens. After 50 and 250 hr, only
slight increases in alpha count were found, while
no penetration could be detected by microscopic

examination, A graphite sample was then exposed -

to the NaF-ZrF -UF, mixture at 800°C and it was
observed that after 10 hr there was a sufficient
increase in the alpha count to indicate the presence
of the su!f msude the tesf specimen. o _

temperature.

In a series of experlments, 10-g somples of NaOH
were sealed in l/.‘,,x 3 in, tubes of nickel, and each
tube was sealed in a quartz jacket. Three sizes
of quartz jackets, approximately 25, 42, and 73 ml,
respectively, were used. The specimens were
soaked at 800°C for periods of 3 to 729 hr, and
after cooling to room temperature the pressure of
H, in each was determined by breaking the quartz
jacket inside a calibrated volume in which the
pressure could be ascertained.

The quantities of hydrogen recovered from the
capsules are shown in Table 2.5.1, and the pres-
sure (extrapolated to 800°C) of hydrogen in each

from the data that in these experiments the hydrogen
pressure, as calculated, ond the amount of hydrogen
recovered passes through a relatively sharp maxi-
mum at cbout 100 hr and drops to a negligible
value. The amounts of hydrogen recovered seem
to be somewhat dependent on the volume of the
system. ‘ :
. These results must be considered somewhat sur-
prising in that they indicate that after about 100 hr
the rate of evolution of hydrogen from the system
become slow with respect to the rate of loss of
hydrogen by diffusion from the quartz envelope.
Whether this phenomenon is due to @ much reduced
rate of reaction or whether the character of the
reaction changes abruptly is not known at present,
Further studies of this situation will be conducted.

samples of various elastomer materials are heated
slowly under tension to 185 to 190°C in NoK in a

failed shortly after reaching 180 to 185°C, ond one
sample of silicone 81578 failed cfter a few hours
at 185 to 190°C. A second specimen of silicone
81578 was still intact after 25 days of exposure.
Two of three Du Pont materials showed promise;
sample SR-5550 failed at 150 to 160°C, but SR-5570
remained intact for nine days at 185 to 190°C,
Sample 5806, a silicone-resin-treated fabric, was

DETERMINATION OF OXY GEN IN NaK
Eo Eo KetChen Go Fo SChean

A source of NaK of known oxygen content is
needed in connection with studies on the solu-
bility of structural metals in NoK, and thus «
reliable and practical method for analyzing for
oxygen is required. A study has been made of
oxygen determinations by the amalgam and the
butyl bromide methods in an attempt to evaluate
the methods and establish whether or not any corre-
lation exists between the results obtained. The
amalgam method, in which NaK is removed from the
oxides by mercury, appeared to be the most adapt-
able, since it could be carried cut in the vacuum
drybox at the time samples of NaK were loaded into
the capsules used in the solubility studies. In
this method, samples of NaK which had been passed

through a 10-p sintered-glass filter, as well as

samples from the same lot that had not been
filtered, were analyzed. The results showed about
10 and 25 ppm of oxygen for the filtered and un-

filtered samples, respectively, The precision was:

good in all cases. To test the butyl bromide
method, samples of the filtered NaK were removed
from the drybox and reacted with dry, purified
n-butyl bromide in a glass vacuum system. When
the water extracts were titrated with 0.1 N HCI to
a pH of 6.5, values of 80 and 130 ppm of oxygen
were obtained. Thus the values obtained by the
butyl bromide method are completely out of line
with those obtained by the amalgam method.” It was
observed, however, that the aqueous extracts
behaved as if they were buffered, and consequently
these results cannot be considered at all reliable.
The cause of this buffering action is being studied
(see Chap. 2.6, *‘Analytical Chemistry’’),

precipitate is ﬁltered, washed, and then ignited to
Ta,04. This oxide is fused with potassium pyro-
sulfate, the melt is dissolved in ammonium oxalate,
and the tantalum is determined with pyrogallol.
An investigation was made of the minimum con-
centration of tantalum that could be recovered from
synthetic samples by means of the tannin precipi-
tation. It was found that approximately 100 ug of
tantalum was lost in the precipitation step. This
amount of tantalum appeared to be fairly constant
for the separation of tantalum from vranium, zirco-
nium, or a mixture of these two elements., The
separation of tantalum from uranium or zirconium
seems to be practical only for amounts of tantalum
greater than 1000 ug.

- were titrated and that a buffering action occurred

in the titration when the NaK was reacted with

’-bufyl bromide. Since no buffering was observed in

the titration of the oxide in the butyl bromide de-
termination. of oxygen in metallic sodium,’ an
investigation is being carried out to determine the
the source of the buffering action and to evaluate
such action as a source of error in the bufyl bro-
mide methed. :

. No ewdence was found for the formanon of weak
organic acids during the reaction of NaK with butyl
bromide, and it was therefore postulated that: the
buffering could be caused by the presence of traces
of metallic contaminants in the NaK. [f the me-
tallic ions formed weakly dissociated hydroxides,
they could produce the observed buffering effect.

Spectrographic analyses of NaK samples showed
gluminum and silicon to be the principal contami-
nants. The aluminum content was found to vary
from 7 to 20 ppm, and it is known that 20 ppm is
sufficient to cause buffering comparable to that
observed in the titration of oxygen in NaK.: The
aluminum cannot, however, account for the extenf
to which the oxide concentrations found by using
the butyl bromide methed are higher than those
obtained by using the amalgamation procedure. |

Experiments are being continued to determine
whether other contaminants which might contribute
to the high oxide titration are present in NaK.
Also, tests of the amalgamation procedure will be
carried out in metal apparatus which was designed
by ‘Nuclear Development Associates.!® The amal-
gam ‘is filtered through a 10-x filter in this appa-
ratus, and alkali metal oxide should be detected
which may be entrained in the amalgam durmg the

incorporated in the part of the system from which

the sample is to be removed. The modified sam-

pler'2 can be attached at any point in a system
at which a Jamesbury valve can be connected to
provide access to the alkali metal. A Jamesbury
valve is a reliable, compact, vacuum-tight, ball.
type valve which is completely opened or closed,
by a one-quarter ‘turn of the handle. ' In the modi-

fied sampler, a glass-to-metal Wilson seal was

vsed in place of the original packlng-g!and seal

" to facilitate the compIete removal of oxygen from

the sompling opparatus, and a Teflon-packed
Jomesbury valve, as described above, was used in
place of the Teflon-packed gate valve.!3 The
modified sampler is similar to ¢ sampler used
earlier by the Metallurgy Division at ORNL,14

- A sample is obtained with the modified apparatus
by placing a nickel bucket in the sampler and then
connecting the sampler to the sampling port. The
sampler and the sampling port are freed of air by

~ clternately evacuating . and purging with dry,

oxygen-free helium. The bucket is lowered into

the alkali metal through the sampling port. The

filled bucket is . withdrawn and transferred to a
pyrex receiver, where it is sealed off under vacuum.
There is apparently negligible contamination of the
alkali metal during sempling. Concentrations of
oxygen as low as 20-ppm have been determined in
samples of sodium that were taken by using this

fithium at high temperatures.

Determinction of Oxygen

An apparatus for the determination of oxygen in
metallic lithium by the amalgamation method has
been assembled. In this apparatus, which was
designed by Nuclear Development Associates,!5
the sample of lithium is amalgamated in o heated
stainless steel reaction chamber in order to limit

- explosion hazards and to eliminate possible oxide

contamination of the lithium by contact with glass-
ware. The lithium oxide is separated from the
amalgam by filtration through a nickel micrometallic
filter of 10-u porosity, which is welded into the
bottom of the amalgamation vessel, After the oxide
is washed free of amalgam with mercury, it is
dissolved in water and titrated with a standardized
solution of acid. This titration must be corrected
by subtracting the volume of titrant that is required
to titrate the Li N and Li,C, which accompany the
oxide.

The apparatus, which is shown in Fig. 2.6.1,
was modified by the addition of a special sample
port to the amalgamation chamber, A 3/ -in. Jomes-
bury valve was welded to the upper opemng of the
amalgamation vessel, and the valve was fitted with
a 29/42 standard-foper joint fabricated from stain-.
less steel. When the joint is coupled to a sample
chamber that is olso fitted with a Jamesbury valve
and ¢ standard-taper joint, the intervening volume
can be evacuated and purged with an inert gas.
The sample can then be transferred without atmos-

- pheric contamination.

Investigations are also being carried out to find
o method for the determination of oxygen in me-
tallic - Iuthmm by titration of the oxide, after con-

- version of the metalllc lithium to a neutral lithium

halide. The butyl bromide method,” which was

ift':rund to be more convenient for the determination

of oxygen in sodium than the amalgamation pro-

.cedure, cannot be applied to the analysis of lithium,
" The reaction between lithium and n-butyl bromide
is too slow for analytical application and may
yield lithium alkyls which react with water to form

hydroxides. It was found that the lithium alkyls

“could be ‘eliminated effectively by the addition of
- an excess of elemental halogen. The lithium metal

is dissolved much more rapidly in the presence of
ether, in a manner analogous to the Grignard re-
action. The most rapid dissolution was accom-
plished with solutions of n-butyl iodide in diethyl
ether, lodine is added to the solution to destroy
organolithium compounds. Samples of lithium of
approximately 2 g will dissolve in '/2 hr. The
following reactions are postulated for the dissolu-
tion of lithium:

2Li +2C Hgl —> 2Lil + CH,,
2Li + CHyl +(GH;),0 —> LiCH,-(C,Hg),0 + Lil
LiC Hg(C,H,),0 + 1, —> Lil + C Hyl + (C,Hy),0

- The halogenation procedure may offer additional
advantages in that the free iodine is postulated to

128

oxidize lithium nitride and carbide and thus elimi-
nate their contribution to the alkalimetric titration.
Thus the oxide is determined by direct titration,
and the uncertainties inherent in the determination
by difference are eliminated. These postulated
oxidation reactions, which are thermodynamically
feasible, have not yet been demonstrated with pure
Li,N and Li,C,, but they are supported 'by an-
alyses of lithium samples in which the oxide
titration is significantly less than that required for
the titration of the nitrides and carbides.

In the procedure that is now being tested, a 2-g
sample of metallic lithium is added to a solution
that contains 100 ml of n-butyl iodide, 200 ml of
diethyl ether, and 15 g of iodine. After the dis-
solution of the sample is completed, the ether is
volatilized and the organic solvent is extracted
with water, The aqueous phase is titrated poten-

tiometrically with a 0.01 N solution of hydrochloric -

acid to a pH of 7. The iodine is removed from an'

aliquot of the titrated solution and the lithium

iodide in the aliquot is titrated with a solution of-.

silver nitrate to determine the sample weight.
Concentrations of oxygen in lithium as low as
200 ppm have been determined by this procedure.

Determination of Nitrogen and Carbon

The method proposed by Nuclear Development
Associates 15 for the determination of nitrogen and
carbon in metallic lithium is being evaluated. In
this procedure the sample is dissolved in water to

‘convert the nitrides and carbides into ammonia and

acetylene, respectively. Ammonia is absorbed from
the exit gases by a boric acid scrubber and is
determined spectrophotometrically. After the mois-
ture is removed, the acetylene is passed over
heated copper oxide to convert it to carbon dioxide,
which is absorbed on ascarite and weighed. A
modification of this procedure in which the acety-
lene is absorbed in a solution of AgNO, is being
tested as a possible means for improving the
sensitivity of the determination of carbide. The
acetylene is absorbed in a 35% solution of AgNO,,.
When the solution is diluted twentyfold, the acety-

lene is precipitated and weighed as the compound -
 Ag,C,-AgNO;. This procedure offers a fivefold

increase in the sensitivity of the determination and
is selective for acetylene.

DETECTION OF TRACES OF NcK IN AIR
A. S. Meyer, Jr. J. P. Young

Two methods are being studied for the detection
of traces of NaK in air. Functional descriptions
of the methods and the operational requirements of
the necessary apparatus were presented previ-
ously. 16 The electronic and optical components of
the instrument designed for the photometric de-

tection of microgram quantities of NaK in air have

been fabricated. The detailed engineering drawings

of the instrument for the detection of submicrogram
quantities of NaK in air by observation -of the -

sodium resonance radiation have been prepared,

Experiments were' continued in an effort to find a
means for introducing reproducible concentrations

of sodium into air.'7 When helium which contained

20 to 100 pug of sodium vapor per liter was mixed

with 10 times its volume of air, at least 95% of the
sodium was removed from the air stream before it
had traversed a 3-in. length ‘of transfer line. The
stability of such suspensions of sodium oxide was
not improved by varying the tempercture of the
transfer line from 150 to 900°C or by altering the
design of the mixing chamber to increase the
velocities of the streams of helium and air. |

Since it was not possible to prepare mixtures of
sodium oxide in gir that could be transferred by a
jet of helium, @ small test facility will be fabri-
cated which will more closely simulate the condi-

constructed for the ejection of minute quantities of

NaK at a metered rate. This jet of NaK will be
injected directly into an air duct, The air will be
passed through the duct at velocities comparable |
. to those required for: the cooling of NaK radiators

in the ART, and the air will be’ heated electﬂcolly,

and molten fluoride salts with the lubricants which
are proposed for use in ART pumps. These ex-
periments dre designed to simulate the conditions
that would exist if leaks developed in the seals
of the fuel or coolant pumps. It is necessary to

determine whether a hazardous condition would

result from an exothermic reaction between the
molten materials and the lubricants.

The reactions between samples of Dowtherm-A
(diphenyl oxide) and of Cellulube-150 (tricresyl

- phosphate) -at 200°F with sodium maintained at
" 1100°F were carried out in the apparatus 18 which

was developed for the determination of oxygen in

- sodium by the addition of molten sodium to butyl
bromide. Approximately 100 ml of each of these
lubricants was placed in the glass reaction vessel

and heated to the desired temperature with o
heating mantle. The temperature of the oil was
measured by placing a thermometer within the re-
action vessel, After the transfer line was flushed
with sodium at 1100°F, approximately 5 g of the

‘metal was allowed to drop into the lubricant. The

reaction with the Cellulube was quite vigorous
and exothermic, while there was very little reaction
between the molten sodium and the Dowtherm-A
sample.

In order to provide a versatile apparatus for
testing the compatibility of additional lubricants
with both alkali metals and fused fluoride salts,
the test apparatus shown in Fig. 2.6.2 was de-
signed and constructed, In operation, the melt pot
is half-filled with either alkali metal or fluoride
salt. After the oddition of the oil sample to the
reaction vessel, the apparatus is assembled as

EXTR-ACTION OF ART FUEL COMPONENTS
WITH TRIOCTYLPHOSPHINE OXIDE

A, S. Meyer, Jr. W, J. Ross

“An investigation has been initiated of the ex-
traction of ART fuel components, corrosion prod-
ucts, and fission products from acidic solutions
into solutions of trialkylphosphine oxides in an
organic solvent. Trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO),
which has been recommended for the extraction of
vranium from leach liquor,'® has been found to
offer two methods for supplementing the existing
analytical methods. Traces of structural metals,
iron, and chromium can be readily concentrated by
extraction from solutions of the fluoride fuels or
alkali metals, and thus the sensitivity of the meas-
urement of the accumulation of corrosion products
can be improved. The extraction may also be used
toisolate certain elements, particularly rare earths,
so that sensitive and convenient methods may be
applied to their determination. ,

Initial results show that TOPO extracts metal
ions from acidic solutions into organic solvents,
such as cyclohexane or Varsol, through the forme-

~ tion of definite complexes. The extent to which

the extraction of Cré*, Fe2*, and Zr4* occurs can

. be made quantitative, or the extraction of the ele-

ments can be completely prevented by varying such
experimental conditions as type and .concentration

 of the acid that is used as a solvent for the fluo-
The results are practically -

independent of equnl:braﬂon periods longer than

‘5 min and of ratios of volumes of the aqueous and
- organic. phases. A rapid method of isolating and

concentrating the components is fherefore avml-

“able. .

Trioctylphosphine oxide does not extract Nit**
Crt*t, La***, or the rare earths. Ferrous ion is
pamally extracted from HCl because of slow oxi-
dation to Fet**,

Since the excess TOPO remains in the organic
phase, the elements which are not extracted can be
determined by the usual methods . Thus, the rare-
earth elements can be separated from the fuel
constituents which would interfere with their spec-

" trophotometric determination. Preliminary studies

indicate that other typical fission products, such
as barium and rubidium, also remain in the aqueous
solution,

‘While the extracted ions can be stripped from the
organic phase for subsequent spectrophotometric
determination in the aqueous solution, more con-
venient determinations of iron and chromium can be
carried out by direct measurement of the absorbance

of the extract. The molar absorbance indices for

the absorption maxima of the Fe*** complex that is

extracted from 2 to 9 M HCI is 8000 ot 365 myu and
7500 ot 317 my. These values are comparable to
the molar absorbance index of the iron ortho-
phenanthroline complex (11,400 at 508 mp).20
Extracts of hexavalent chromium exhibit absorp-
tion maxima at 366 mu and 285 my, with indices of
1300 and 1700, respectively. A more sensitive
spectrophotometric determination of chromium may
be obtained by developing the color with diphenyl

carbazide in the organic phase. A survey of the

extractability of other elements which may be
present in experimental fuels is now being carried

out,

of trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) in organic sol-
vents. When a 0.25% solution of diphenyl carbazide

in ethano!l is added to solutions of hexavalent

chromium which have been extracted from 2 M
solutions of sulfuric or hydrochloric acid, ¢ violet
color is developed which is similar to that formed
in an aqueous solution. The organic solutions
exhibit an absorbance maximum at the same wave-
length as that observed in the aqueous solution
(550 mp). When ethanol is used as a diluent, the
molar absorbance index is identical to that ob-
tained in aqueous solutions. Since the chromium
may be concentrated at least twentyfold by ex-
tracting the aqueous solutions with small volumes
of TOPO solution, the method affords a significant

‘increase in sensitivity, The method may also offer

a means for the elimination of the interference of
vanadium, which is not extracted from solutions of
sulfuric acid.

It is proposed to apply this procedure to the de-
termination of hexavalent chromium in a sulfuric
acid solution of fluoride salts or in acid solutions
of alkali metals in 2 M H.‘,SO4 or HCi. The solu-
tion is equilibrated with 5 ml of a 0.1 M solution
of TOPO in benzene. An aliquot of the organic
phase is transferred immediately to a 25-ml volu-
metric flask, Two mitliliters of a 0.25% solution of

132

diphenyl carbazide is odded, and the solution is
diluted to volume with ethanol. “After 1 hr the
absorbance of the solution is measured at 550 my.
Tests are currently being made to evolucte this
particular application. :

Fuel Mlxtures in. Inconel und Hasfe"oy B.

" Two Inconel forced-cnrculohon loops were' ex-

~ amined following-1000 hr of operation with the fuel .
. mixture {No.’ 70) NaF- ZrF -UF, (56- 39-5 mole %).

The purpose “of these tests was fo compare the
corrosion properties of this fuel mixture with those

of the similar, more commonly used, -fuel mixture

(No. 30) NaF-ZrF ,-UF (50-46-4 mole %) : The

lower ZrF4 content of maxture No. 70 gives a fuel

. with a considerably lower vapor pressure at reac-
tor operahng temperatures than that of muxture o

- No. 30.

The conditions of operahon for these two Ioops,'

7425-14 and 7425-15, are given in Table 3.1.1.
Operation of the Ioops, including the cleaning
procedue, followed the same pattern as that
normally employed for tests with fuel mixture
No. 30. Visual examination of loop 7425-14, which
was operated with @ maximum fluid temperature of
about 1500°F, showed the presence of few very
small metallic crystuls in the top section of the
cooling coil and ulong the fluid—inert gas inter-

face in the pump. These crystals wer_e_ found by

sééctermphic examination to be >5% Cr, >5% Zr,
2% Ni, and 0.2% Fe. Although the fuel undoubtedly

icompnsed a large portion of the crystals, the
- presence of chromium indicates possible mass

transfer. However, no crystals could be found in
loop 7425-]5 which operated with the same tem-

. -perature gradient but a higher maximum fiuid tem-

perature of about 1650°F,

The .maximum hot-leg attack observed metallo-

. graphically was to a depth of 7 mils and was ap-

proximately the same for both loops. The attack
occurred as light to moderate void formation, as

~ shown in Fig. 3.1.1..

The similarity in the attack in the two loops

(7425-14 and -15);, which operated at different

-maximum fluid temperatures, is thought to have

limited significance. For loops operated with
fuel No. 30 under similar conditions, the average

- hot-leg attack is 4.5 mils at a maximum fluid
temperature of 1500°F and 9 mils at a moximum

fluid temperature of 1650°F. The value of 7 mils

for the hot-leg attack at both temperatures in the

tests with fuel No. 70 is felt to be within the
range of possible experimental deviations and
does not represent an abnormally large difference

- from either of the values obtained for fuel No. 30.

A sample of the very thin metallic layer which
was deposited in the cold legs of both loops is
shown in Fig. 3.1.2. The layer was barely visible
at a magnification of 500X, and thus may be seen
to be quite thin. It was not possible to analyze
this layer. Deposited layers of this type have not
been found in loops operated with fuel No. 30.

Analyses of fuel samples taken before and after
operation of these loops are presented in Table
3.1.2. The ancalyses indicate that the chromium
content increased during the tests, but the final
chromium values were somewhat lower than those
usually found in the fuel mixture (No. 30) NaF-
ZrF UF, (50-46-4 mole %), when tested under
comparable conditions.

A Hastelloy B forced-circulation loop (7425-13)
was also examined following 1000 hr of operation.
This loop circulated the fuel mixture (No. 107)
NaF-KF-LiF-UF, (11.2-41-45.3-2.5 mole %) under
the conditions given in' Table 3.1.1. The loop was
constructed of 3’2-in.-OD, 0.035-in.-wall tubing and
was identical in configuration and manner of
heating to the standard loops presently employed
for Inconel corrosion tests. !

The results of the examination verified the
excellent corrosion resistance of Hastelloy B to

The operation of an Inconel forced-circulation
loop -as an endurance test with the fuel mixture

terminated because of a pump-drive failure after
8300 hr. A leck developed in the cold leg while
‘the loop was being heated to re-establish operation

temperature of 1450°F, a temperatute drop of
200°F, a maximum wall temperature of 1550°F, and
‘a Reynolds number of 10,000.  Metallographic ex-

face and heavy intergranular void formation to a
depth of 25 mils. The cold-leg surface was also
roughened, but there was no evidence of mass-
transferred deposits.

the rate of attack noted in the test period from 50
to 1000 hr was 3 to 4 miis per 1000 hr. [t would
appear on the basis of these tests of longer dura-
tion, however, that the rate of attack decreased for

the longer operating times, although the operating -

conditions of the loops are unfortunately not simi-
lar enough to provide a comprehensive study of
attack for operating periods beyond 1000 hr.

Sodium in Incone! and Stainless Steel |

An Inconel forced-circulation loop (7426-11) was
examined which had circulated sodium at a maxi-
mum temperature of 1350°F for 1000 hr. Only
scattered metal deposits were found in cold-zone
sections. The loop was operated with a fluid tem-
perature drop of 300°F, and it contained a bypass

cold trap operated at 300°F. The deposits reached

a maximum thickness of 3 mils, as shown in
Fig. 3.1.4, and were found by analysis to be pre-
domingantly nickel. The hot leg of the loop showed
slight intergi'anul'ar attack to a depth of 0.5 mil.

A relatively heavy deposit, also predominantly
nickel, was found in Inconel loop 7426-12 which
circulated sodium ot a maximum temperature of
1500°F, with a temperature gradient of 400°F, for
1000 hr. The loop included a cold trap identical
to that used in loop 7426-11. The deposits were
found primarily in the economizer section of this
loop, and they reached thicknesses of 20 mils, as

shown in Fig. 3.1.5. There was intergranular -

attack in the hot zone to a depth of 2 mils. The
deposits were scraped from the loop walls and
were found to weigh 21 g. This weight value is to
be compared with a value of 15 g reported previ-
ously for the deposits found in a loop operated for
the same length of time with the same maximum
fluid temperature but with a 300°F temperature

drop.® It thus appears that the increase in tem- |

perature drop from 300 to 400°F appreciably in-
creased the amount of mass transfer. Also it can
be seen that the amount of mass transfer was con-
siderably more in these loops operated at 1500°F
than in the loop operated at 1350°F,

A type 316 stainless steel forced-circulation
loop (7426-14) that had operated for 1000 hr with
sodium at a maximum temperature of 1650°F and a
temperature drop of 300°F was also examined.
Very little increase in mass transfer was found in
comparison with that found in a similar loop op-
erated previously at a maximum temperature of

1500°F .4 Deposits appeared as occasional
clusters of metal crystals 3 to 5 mils thick and
comprised a total weight of 1.7 g. An analysis of
the deposits showed 5.5% Ni, 72.4% Cr, and
22.0% Fe. The hot leg was attacked intergranu-
larly to a depth of 2 mils, and small voids ap-
peared to a depth of 5 mils. A loop fabricated of
type 310 stainless steel (7426-13) and operated
under similar conditions but at a maximum tem-
perature of 1500°F showed substantidlly more ex-
tensive deposits than did the type 316 stainless
steel loop. The total mass of the deposits was
only 225 g, although the deposit thickness
reached 9 mils. Hot-leg attack in this loop was
quite severe, with intergranular attack and void
formation reaching to a depth of 13 mils, as shown

in Fig. 3.1.6.

Sodium-Beryllium-Inconel Compatibility

Two Inconel forced-circulation loops with beryl-
lium inserts in the hot legs were examined that
had operated with sodium at maximum temperatures
of 1250 and 1300°F. The beryllium insert was
machined to the form of a hollow cylinder 2'/2 in.
long, and it contained an Inconel island that was
concentric within the insert. The insert was
separated from the loop wall by a distance of
0.040 in. along 1 in. of its length and by 0.094 in.
along another 1 in. of its length; the remaining
1’2 in. of the insert was in direct contact with the
Inconel loop wall. The Inconel island was spaced
l/4 in. from the inside surface of the insert. The
beryllium insert tested ot 1300°F for 1000 hr
showed scattered void formation to a depth of
7 mils. Alloying between the beryllium and Inconel
in contact with it produced a brittle layer approxi-
mately 3.5 mils thick. In areas where a positive
separation between the beryllium and Inconel was
maintained, no attack or alloying was seen on the
Inconel. In the loop operated at 1250°F for
1000 hr, voids formed in the beryllium insert to a
depth of 5 mils. Although no alloy formation be-
tween beryllium and Inconel was found, even in
areas of direct contact, this result is considered
to be anomalous, since alloying has been seen to
occur even at temperatures as low as 1200°F be-
tween Inconel and beryllium in direct contact in
sodium. Both the loops operated with cold traps
maintained ot 300°F. No mass-transferred par-

ticles or layers were produced in either loop.

The maximum ottack on the beryllium was in
the form of small voids on the outside surface of
the insert. No alloying occurred between the
Hastelloy B and the beryllium across the 0.020-in.
separation in either loop (899 and 900}, but there
was alloy formation where the beryllium came in
direct contact with the Hastelloy B. It appeared
as a homogeneous layer 1 mil thick in loop 899
and as a two-phase layer 3 mils thick in loop 900.
The insert removed from loop 900 had a gray scale
on the outside surface, but no such scale was
present on the insert removed from loop 899. The
x-ray diffraction pattern identified the scale as
Be,yNig. No cold leg deposits were found in
either loop.

Sodium-Beryllium-Inconel Compatibility

A series of five Inconel thermal-convection loops
with beryllium inserts in the hot legs, similar to
those used in the Hastelloy B loops, were op-
erated with sodium for 1000 hr ot maximum fluid
temperatures  of 1200, 1250, 1300, 1400, ond
1500°F. Metaliographic examination of the Inconel
adjacent to the beryllium insert, which was spdced
0.020 % 0.005 in. from the Inconel, showed some

alloy formation in the loops operated at tempera-.

tures of 1300°F and aobove. Nickel-beryllium
alloying typical of that observed is shown in
Fig. 3.1.7. The attack on the beryllium in-
creased, as shown in Table 3.1.4, with increased
fluid temperatures. The deepest attack occurred
on the outside surface of the insert. In all in-
stances, a gray scale, accompanied by a black
deposit, shown'in Fig. 3.1.8, was observed on the

outside and inside surfaces of the insert after the
test.. - These deposnts were also identified by

x-ray diffraction as Be,yyNig.: The thicknesses of

the nickel- bery!lwm alloy formations ranged from
1" mil in loop 914 to a maximum depth of 3.5 mils -
in loop 915; the 3.5-mil formation . is. shown in

Fig. 3. 1.7.. The alloy formed in loop 915 was

pected in view of the lower attacks observed.

Another series of three standard Inconel thermal-
convection loops, 858, 859, and 984, was operated
for 500 hr at 1500°F with reclaimed fuel No. 30.
The purpose of these tests was to determine the
difference, if any, in corrosion results from loops
operated with standard fuel and with fuel reclaimed
after use in other experimental tests. In all cases
the reclaimed fuel had been used in Inconel sys-
tems. The reclamation procedure, which was de-
scribed previously,® consisted of the equilibration
of the fuel with zirconium metal chips and the use
of the standard hydrofluorination-hydrogenation
treatment for the removal of impurities.

may be seen, o definite reduction in chromium
content was effected in the purification treatment.

The summary of the corrosion results, presented
in Table 3.1.5, indicates that a reduction of maxi-
mum hot-leg attack, 2 to 3 mils, occurred in loops
operated with reclaimed fuel that was similar to
the reduction obtained with the fuel prepared with
especially pure ZrF,. This reduction in attack
may be attributed to the removal of impurities from
the fuel through the corrosion processes that oc-
curred during previous operation. It does not ap-
pear to be due to any effect on the level of chro-
mium stemming from prior use of the fuel, since,
as may be seen in Table 3.1.7, the reclamation -
procedure used resulted in a chromium content in
the reclaimed fuel comparable to that of a newly
prepared fuel. However, it should be noted that
any increase in U*** content in these fuels that
resulted from changes in the procedure used fto
prepare the fuels would cause a significant de-
crease in attack. This possibility unfortunately
is difficult to evaluate through conventional chemi-
cal analyses.

Screening Tests of Special Fuel Mixtures

A screening program is currently under way in
which the corrosion properties of numerous fluo-
ride mixtures are being evaluated in standard
Inconel thermal-convection loops. Test periods of
500 hr and maximum fluid tenmperatures of 1500°F
are being used. Standard loop filling procedures
are followed, but, since limited amounts of the
fuels are available, the standard precleaning steps
which utilize an extra fill are omitted.

‘The results of the tests that have been com-
pleted are presented in Table 3.1.8 with the data
grouped according to the variable investigated.
Group 1 consists of the zirconium-base fluoride
mixtyre in which the alkali metal fluoride com-
ponents (KF, LiF, RbF, and NaF) were inter-
changed, while the polyvalent fluoride components
(ZrF , and UF 4)'remained constant. The mixtures
are all similar to the fuel mixture (No. 30) NaF-
ZrF UF, (50-46-4 mole %). In these fuel sys-
tems it was desired to establish the corrosion
properties accompanying the various alkali flue-
rides in combination with ZrF, and UF,. Fuels
of the same type but with slightly higher alkali
metal fluoride contents cre also included in this
group.

In group 2 are listed fluoride mixtures which are
complexed with sodium and lithium and which
contain various amounts of ZrF, These fuels
were tested to determine the level of ZrF, below
which such mixtures show corrosion behavior
typical of the fluoride mixture (No. 12) NaF-KF-
LiF (11.5-42-46.5 mole %) rather than the hlgher
ZrF 4-content fuels such as fuel No. 30.

The fuels listed in group 3 were investigated to
determine what effect an increase of the UF
content in a zirconium-base mixture would have on
the corrosion of Inconel. This list of fuels is in-

- complete, with several _mixtures remalnmg to be

evaluated. :

The fuels in group 4 were tested to determlne
whether mass transfer in systems contalnlng BeF,
is a function of the ratio of NaF to BeF '

~ In the group 1 tests involving KF; LIF,‘ RbF,
and NaF systems in combination with ZrF,, the
lowering of the ZrF , content from 46 to 40 mole %

produced no significant effect on the attack in

NaF-containing systems and increased the attack

from 1 to 2 mils in the KF- and RbF-containing
systems. The system containing LiF showed
quite anomalous behavior in that the attack de-

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1956

creased murkedly wuth the decrease in ZrF,
content.

The loops operated with fuels containing more
than 50 mole % of the alkali-metal fluoride, with
the exception of the KF-containing system, showed
traces of metallic crystals in the cold leg. In
analyzing the systems from the standpoint of inter-
changing the alkali-metal fluoride component while

‘maintaining the over-all composition constant

(specifically MF-ZrF -UF,, 50-46-4 mole % and
56-40-4 mole %), it wos observed that the KF-
containing system gave the least attack. At the
begiming of the tests, it was expected that the
LiF system would yield the least corrosion; how-
ever, as seen from the data, it produced the maxi-
mum attack.

In order to obtain further corrosion data for the
Kl"'-ZrF“-'UF4 (50-46-4 mole %) mixture, which
showed somewhat less attack than the other sys-
tems, two additional Inconel loops were operated
under the same conditions but for a period of
1500 hr. This increase of operating time from
500 to 1500 hr was accompanied by an increase in
maximum attack of only 2 mils.

In the group 2 tests, little change in hot-leg
attack accompanied the ZrF ,-content decreases.
However, in contrast to results obtained in stand-
ard loops operated with the NaF-ZrF -UF, (50-
46-4 mole %) mixture (fuel No. 30), ewdences of
metallic layers and/or evidences of metallic
crystals were observed metallographically. The
presence of LiF in such mixtures, even those with
46 mole % ZrF‘, did not affect the corrosion

‘appreciably.

As may be seen in Table 3.1.8, an appreciable

~ increase in attack was observed in the tests of
- fuel mixtures containing 26 mole % UF (group 3).

Also, metallographic exammaflon showed metallic

deposits, possibly uranium, in the hot legs of

these loops. However, the increase from 5 to
12 mole % UF, did not seem to affect the corro-
sion. No hot-leg deposits were noted in the loops
operating with the fuel mixture containing the

- lower concentrations of uranium fluoride.

In the bulk of the tests of special fuel mixtures,
especially those in group 4, metallic layers and/or
metallic deposits were noted in the cold legs.
However, because these tests were conducted for
a relatively short time, 500 hr, it is not possible
to accurately assess the mass-transfer properties.
It should be noted that increasing the LiF content

plastic state, which allows the tube to be forged
into position, as shown in Fi,gs. 3.2.1 ond 3.2.2.
The bond is achieved by recrystallization of the

was to determine the corrosion resistance of this
recrystallized area. It was found that the NaK
attacked the specimen to a maximum depth of 0.5
mil in the recrystaliized area and the header plate
(Fig. 3.2.3). The fused salt attacked the header
plate to a maximum depth of 1.5 mils in the form
of small, subsurface voids, but this attack dropped

TESTS OF COAST METALS BRAZING ALLOY
NO. 53 IN NaK AND IN FLUORIDE FUEL

D. Hc Jan sen

It was established in previous corrosion tests
that boron is leached from the surface of Coast
Metals brazing alloy No. 52 (89% Ni-5% Si-4% B-
2% Fe) when it is exposed to the fluoride fuels at
1500°F, and it was therefore decided to test a
substitute alloy which might not be as susceptible
to boron leaching but would still maintain good
corrosion resistance to the fluoride fuels. Buttons
of Coast Metals No. 53 (81% Ni-8% Cr—4% B-
4% Si-3% Fe) were corrosion tested in the fuel
mixture {No, 44)NaF-ZrF -UF , (53.5-40-6.5mole %)
and in NaK {56-44 wt %)} in the hope that the chro-
‘mium would tie up the boron and retard its removal
from the surface of the alloy. The same type of
depleted crea as found in Coast Metals No. 52
oppeared, however, in the No. 53 alloy after both

the test in NaK and- the test in the fluoride fuel.
The No, 53 alloy is shown in Fig. 3.2.6 after ex-
posure to the: fuel mixture at temperatures of 1400
and 1500°F for 100 hr. A spectrographic traverse
on the alloy button tested in NaK at 1500°F showed
that, between the surface and a depth of 6 to 7 mils,
the concentration of boron was less than one-third
its value in the interior, Chemical analyses of
the NaK and the fuel mixture have not yet been
completed, All the test systems had surface-to-
volume ratios of 0,83 in.~'. This ratio was cal-
culated by using only the surface areas of the
alloy buttons; the area of the capsule wall that
was covered with the test bath was not included.
Tests will be conducted later in which the surface-
to-volume ratio will be altered to determine whether
it has any effect on the rate of depletion. Results
of the tests described above are given in Table
3.2.1.

NIGBIUM IN SODIUM AND IN LITHIUM
R. Carlander?

Seesaw apparatus was used for corrosion tests
of niobium in sodium ond in lithium in order to
determine the corrosion resistance of this material
in a dynamic system. Two niobium capsules, 15 in.
long, were filled to 40% of their volume, one with
sodium and the other with lithium, and sealed under
en inert atmosphere. The capsule filled with
sodium was enclosed in an Inconel container,
ond the capsule filled with lithium was enclosed
in a Hastelloy B container. The space between
both the lithium- and the sodium-filled capsules
and their containers was then filled to 40% of its
volume with sodium in order to cobtain good heat
transfer between the capsule and the container
(Fig. 3.2.8). The capsules were tested in a tilting
furnace at 1 cpm for 100 hr with the hot zone at
1535°F and the cold zone ot 995°F,

No mass transfer was found in the niobium cap-
sules, but some dissimilar-metal mass transfer,
detectable only at high magnifications, was found
on the Hastelloy B and the Inconel container walls

ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

VAPOR.ZONE ATTACK IN INCONEL.FLUORIDE
FUEL SYSTEMS

R. Carlander

In several creep experiments on Inconel in the
fuel mixture (No. 44) NaF-ZrF -UF , (53.5-40-6.5
mole %) extremely heavy attack on portions of the

system in the regions above the bath level has

been detected. This type of attack was also noted
in experimental tests of a ZrF -vapor trap fabri-
cated from type 316 stainless steel. A further
investigation has now been made in a test con-
ducted in a manner to approximate roughly the con-
ditions in the creep experimenis where the heavy
attack on Inconel was originally noted.

Evacuated Inconel capsules were exposed to
static NaF-ZrF UF, (53.5-40-6.5 mole %) at
1600°F for 500 and 1000 hr. Two capsules, 12 in.
long, were used in which '/2-in.-diu Inconel thermo-
couple probes extended to within 1 in. of the
bottom. The level of the fluoride mixture bath and
the height of the heated zone was 4 in. A tempera-
ture gradient was maintained over the rest of the
system, Examinations of the capsules after the
tests revealed that the ZrF, vapor had deposited
around the walls of the capsule approximately 1 in.
acbove the original bath level, where the tempera-
ture was approximately 1100°C, A hard layer that
reached a maximum thickness of I/4 in. and con-
sisted of the fiuorides (NaF, ZrF4, and UF ) end
small particles of NiO, Fe, and Cr was found in
a region ‘/.‘, in, above and below the original bath
level. The capsule tested for 1000 hr is shown in
Fig. 3.2.11. Chemical ancalysis of the bath and
of the thermocouple probe revealed that chromium,
as could be expected, was the main element leached
out of the Inconel in both tests. A sample of the
flucride mixture taken from the bottom of the bath
was richer in chromium than a sample taken from
the top. - The results of the chemical analyses are
given in Table 3,2.3.

Metallographic examination revecled that the
portion of the capsule wall around which the vapor
deposited was unattacked in both capsules. The

heaviest attack occurred in the bath zone of both.

capsules. The attack reached a maximum depth
of 4 mils in the 500-hr test and 5 mils in the
1000-hr test (Fig. 3.2.12). The depletion of ZrF‘
from the bath actually decreased the ottack from
that normally observed, and this attack, by itself,
could not have caused the failures in the creep
tests,

CARBURIZATION OF VARIOUS ALLOYS
BY MOLTEN SODIUM '

E. E. Hoffman R. Carlander

The carburization and decarburization of various
alloys by molten sodium at elevated temperatures
has often been observed. The carburization of
stainless steel by sodium contaminated with carbon
results in precipitation at the grain boundaries of
a complex iron-chromium carbide. This precipita-
tion depletes the adjacent grain boundory areas of
chromium, and thus forms areas of a different
‘*stainless’’ composition. Also, the grain bound-
aries become susceptible to intergranular cotrosion.
Hence, an effort was made to study the various
factors that affect the carburization of various
alloys by sodium. '

ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

Specimens (2 x 1 x '4; in.) of Hastelloy B and
types 310, 316, and 430 stainless steel were

measured, polished, and weighed prior to testing.

The specimens were loaded into capsules of the
same material, filled with sodium plus 1, 5, and
10 wt % additions of graphite, and sealed under
vacuum. The capsules were then tested in static

sodium at 1500°F for 100 hr. Upon completion of
the tests, the specimens were removed from the
capsules, cleaned, and weighed, and portions of
each were analyzed chemically and metallo-
graphically. The results are presented in Tables

3.2.13) exhibited the least amount of carburiza-
tion, while types 316 and 430 stainless steel
(Fig. 3.2.14) were heavily carburized,

The results can be exploined by the use of
generally accepted - facts about carburization,
Nickel, for example, decteases the rate of pene-
tration of carbon in steel. Therefore, comporing
the three stainless steels, type 430 stainless
steel (less than 0.5 wt % Ni) was carburized to
the deepest extent, while type 310 stainless steel
(20 wt % Ni) experienced the smallest depth of
carbon penetration. Also, the austenitic lattice
dissolves more carbon than the ferritic lattice;
hence, although the depth of carburization was

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1956

less in the type 310 stainless steel (austenitic),
the amount of carbon in @ 3-mil surface cut was
approximately the same as that in a similar cut of
type 430 stainless steel (ferritic)y Type 316
stainless steel, which has less nickel and chromium
than type 310 stainless steel, experienced a greater
depth of carbon penetration and had a greater
carbon concentration at the surface. Because of
its -nickel content, Hastelloy B was not expected
to carburize as heavily as it actually did. How-
ever, the presence of molybdenum (a strong carbide
former) in stainless steels renders them more

‘susceptible to carburization, and this may explain

the carburization of Hastelloy B, which also con-
tains molybdenum.

SODIUM-BERYLLIUM-INCONEL COMPATIBILITY
IN ASTATIC SYSTEM (TEST NO. 2)

The test procedure and the results of sodium-
beryllium-Inconel compatibility test No. 1 were
given in the previous report.®> The results of the
first test indicated that a chromium plate on the
Inconel surface in contact with the beryllium would
reduce the extent of the alloying reaction which
occurs when Inconel and beryllium are in direct
contact in sodium., The thin chromium platings
(1 and 2 mils) used in the first test were entirely
consumed by alloying during the 1000-hr test period
at 1300°F. Therefore o second test was conducted
in which heavier platings were used. A beryllium
oxide specimen was alsc included in this test to
determine whether a reaction would occur between

160

beryllium oxide and beryllium or beryllium oxide
and Inconel. *

The results of this test are given in Table 3.2.6.
The presence of a chromium plate *‘diffusion
barrier’’ on the Inconel specimen resulted in the
formation of an alloy layer (principally Be,Cr)
which was approximately one-third the thickness
of the alloy layer which forms when Inconel is

‘placed in direct contact with beryllium under the

conditions of this test.

Analyses of the test resuhs indicate that a
minimum of 5 mils of chromium plate will be neces-
sary to ensute that all the chromium is not con-
sumed by the alloying reaction with beryllium. The
Be,Cr phase was identified by x-ray analysis.

Thls phase has a Vickers hardness of 2440, as

compared with hardnesses of 1495 for Be,Nig,
the phase which forms when Inconel and beryllium
are in direct contact, and 180 for Inconel (Figs.

high-temperature systems are much more difficult
than those found with liquid sodium at high tem-

tests have indicated that nickel and nickel-base
alloys are very heavily aftacked even by static,
isothermal lithium, and thus many of the commer-
cially available high~temperature alloys, are elimi-
ncted from consideration. Pure iron has shown

good resistance to lithium, and therefore con-
siderable effort has been directed towards tests
on iron-base alloys, in particular, the stamless

phases were located in the few open spaces be-
tween the particles of the major phase. The
NiAl + 5% Ni specimens were the only ones in
which potosity was found, and it was negligible in
these,

_For the NiAl-base intermetallic compounds the
tused-salt attack was probably due to the aluminum.
The attack began intergranularly and advanced into
the grains. The differences in the extent of the
fused salt attack on the NiAl-base intermetallic
compounds was probably caused by differences in
the accessibility of the NiAl to the fused salt,
In the NiAl + 5% Ni specimen it was noted that the
attack was most severe where the ‘‘oxide’’ phase
was concentrated. It is assumed that oxide quickly

172

corroded away and allowed the fused salt to attack
the intermetallic compound.

The severe attack in the case of the NiAl + 4%
Zr specimen can probably be explained by the
removal of both the common phase and the zir-
conium, These corrosion tests indicate that the
NiAl compound in the NiAl-base intermetallic com-
pound was attacked when it was exposed to NaF-

ZrF UF,, (53.5-40-6.5 mole %) at 1500°F.

The poor corrosion resistance of these inter-
metallic compounds in the fused salt obviates
further tests in this medium, However, the results
of the sodium tests are encouraging enough to
warrant more severe corrosion tests in sodium.

NICKEL-MOLYBDENUM ALLOY
DEVELOPMENT

T. K. Roche

The search was continued for a superior nickel-
molybdenum-base alloy with the corrosion re-
sistance of Hastelloy B and elevated-temperature
strength at least equal to that of Hastelloy X.
Seamiess tubing has been fabricated from the
various alloys under consideration to provide
material for evaluation in thermal-convection
loops. The extrusion techniques described previ-
ously! have been successfully used to produce
tube blanks of the variety of alloy compositions
being studied.

The nickel-molybdenum-base-alloy tube blanks
submitted to the Superior Tube Co. for redrawing
responded satisfactorily, in general, with the
several exceptions being notably the high-carbon-
content compositions. The processing procedure
used for the as-extruded, 1.5-in.-OD, 0.25-in.-wall
tube blanks is to (1) condition the tube blanks
by machining (resultant average weight loss, 50%);
(2) reduce to 0.875-in. OD and 0.095-in. wall
tubing; (3) anneal at 2050°F in a dry hydrogen
atmosphere and water quench; (4) rod draw and
sink to final size, with intermediate anneals; and
(5) finish by sand blasting and rotary polishing.
An average yield of 70% is being obtained from
the blanks after the initial conditioning operation.
It has been found in the processing of these
alloys that lighter cold reductions per pass must
be taken than in the case of stainless steel or
Inconel. A 20% reduction in area per pass is
considered to be optimum. ' '

Battelle Memorial Institute Alloys

Ten tube blanks of three different alloys were
extruded and submitted to Superior Tube. Co. for
redrawing in order to assist Battelle Memorial
Institute “with nickel-molybdenum alloy develop-
ment work - under. way there.! The results of
processing these extrusions to 0.500-in.-0D,
0.035-in.-wall tubing are presented in Table 3.3.1.

The response of these compositions to cold tube-
forming techniques was only moderately suc-
cessful. The difficulties encountered are illus-
trated in Fig. 3.3.1. Metallographic examination
of the failure found in the tube blank of alloy
B-2898 (20% Mo-1% Nb-2% Ti-0.80% Mn-0.12%
C-bal Ni) revealed the stringering of second-phase
particles (that is, carbides), as shown in Fig. 3.3.2,
to be the probable source of the difficulty.

All attempts to produce seamless tubing of alloy
B-2899 (20% Mo-1% Nb-0.80% Mn-0.20% C-bal
Ni) failed. Two of the four extrusions of this
alloy developed longitudinal cracks along their
lengths, as shown in Fig. 3.3.1, while on the
draw bench. The other extrusions, also shown
in Fig. 3.3.1, failed during the initial tube-reducing
operation, Examination of the cracks again
revealed that stringering of the numerous precipi-
tates was the source of failure.

The results indicate that carbon in amounts of
0.20% or greater in the nickel-molybdenum alloys
being ~ investigated will make improbable the
success of the tube-forming process and that
0.12% carbon is marginal in this respect.

feasibility of producing seamless tubing of the
alloys. The tube blanks were extruded at 2150°F
at a ratio of 7:1. All compositions were fabricated
successfully and sent to Superior Tube Co. for
redrawing.

International Nickel Company Alloys

Tube blanks which were fabricated from air-

melted nickel-molybdenum base alloys supplied by

the International Nickel Company have been
returned by Superior Tube Co. after having been
processed to 0.500-in.-OD, 0.035-in.-wall tubing.
The results of the processing are given in
Table 3.3.1. '

For the most part the limited data indicate that
these ' International Nickel Company alloys are
amenable to tube-producing practice, with one
exception. Alloy T-23015, which contained 0.25%
C, could not be successfully reduced to tubing.

Although the failures from these particular tube
blanks were not examined metallographically, it
is felt that carbide stringers, similar to those
shown in Fig. 3.3.2, were again the cause of the

difficulty., Thermal-convection loops are to be -

constructed from the various lengths of tubing
received.

ORNL Alloys

Extrusion experiments outlined previously! for
producing seamless tubing of ternary alloys con-
taining nickel, 15 to 20% molybdenum, and a third

element which can be tolerated without serious
effect on the corrosion resistance of the base

which were fabricated during the quarter and

alloys was carried out at 2150°F at a ratio of 7:1.

The extrusion techniques described previously

were used, and no difficulty was encountered with
these ternary alloys, except the 79% Ni-17%
Mo—4% Al alloy, which offered relatively high
resistance to plastic deformation. This is an
indication of the potency of aluminum in increasing
the elevated-temperature strength of the base
composition,

In addition to the ternary alloys, 36-1b vacuum
induction melts of the new alloys INOR-3, -4,
and -6 were prepared and extruded to tube blanks.
The compositions of these alloys and the results
of the extrusions are given in Table 3.3.3. The
purposes of this series of experiments were to
determine the extrudability of these afloys and to
gain a supply of tubing for corrosion testing, As
indicated in Table 3.3.3, three billets of eoch
alloy were successfully extruded. These ex-
trusions were carried out at 2150°F at a ratio
of 7:1.

The quantities of tubing obtmned from extruded
tube blanks previously submitted to Superior Tube
Co. are listed in Table 3.3.1. In general the
redrawing of the chromium-bearing alloys with
intermediate carbon contents (0.06% or less)
proved to be satisfactory. The percentage yields
of 0.500-in,-0D, 0.035-in.-wali tubing from con-
ditioned tube blanks, as well -as the total length
of tubing of each composition, are also shown
in Table 3.3.1. This tubing is to be fabricated

into thermal-convection loops for corrosion testing.

Gamma-Ray Shielding Material

The thermal conductivities of the six tungsten
carbide—constantan specimens described in the
previous report? were determined, and the data
are presented in Table 3.3.4.

A plot of these data as functions of the volume
percentages of tungsten carbide, constantan, and
pores is presented in Fig. 3.3.4. Examination of
this graph shows the thermal conductivity of this
system to be primarily a function of the tungsten
carbide content, with only minor effects resulting
from variations in porosity. These specimens
bracket quite completely the composition range at
a bulk density of 12.0 g/cm?® ond indicate fairly

 conclusively that the specifications for the gamma-

ray shielding materia! (density, 12.0 g/cm3 ~ mini-
mum; conductivity, 0.10 cal/cm.sec:°C —~ maximum)
cannot be met by the tungsten carbide—constontan
material.

A search for a lower conductivity nickel-base

~alloy for use as a binder resulted in the selection

of Hastelloy C. This alloy has a reported conduc-

thick type 430 stainless steel—clad copper-B4C

(6.6 wt % B C) neutron shield material. A plate
of this material that was fabricated by Allegheny
Ludlum Steel Corp. was evaluated, The plate was
approximately 7% x 23 in. and 0.100 in. thick,

The evaluation included examination of the-

surface finish, radiography, bend fests, tensile
tests, thickness uniformity measurements, core
density measurements, microstructure examinations,
and investigation of the integrity of the clad«to-
core bonding. No pinholes were evident in the
10-mil-thick cladding stripped from the core
material, although the surface finish on the
cladding was rough. No.segregation of the B,C
or cracking of the core was observed, and the
clad was well-bonded to the core material. The
density of the copper-B 4C cermet, as measured by
the water-displacement method, was 97.9% of
theoretical. Small specimens that had been cut
parallel and transverse to the rolling direction
were bent to a radius of curvature of %, and
27, in., respectively, before fracture occurred,
The plate tapered along the length from a maximum
thickness of 0.099 in. to a minimum thickness of
0.092 in. The dispersion of B C particles in the
copper matrix was excellent. The room-temper-
ature tensile strength data for the material are
presented in Table 3.3.7.

The tensile specimens were punched out with a
blanking die and were 5 in. long with a 2-in, gage
length. The as-punched tensile specimen showed
no elongation and failed at the yield point of the
material, Specimen 4 was prepared by stripping
the cladding from the copper-B 4C core prior to
punching the specimen. :

verse sections of the extruded tube showed the
core cross section to be fairly uniform, except in
one area. The nonuniform area can be atiributed
to the sintering and concomitant shrinkage of the
core during the preheating operation, which can
cause longitudinal cracks in the core as a result
of shrinkage around the inner cladding layer or the
formation of void areas between the core and the

" SEAMLESS TUBULAR FUEL ELEMENTS
M. R. D’Amore

Two three-ply blanks containing cores of 30

vel % Al,O; (to simulate UQ,) dispersed in type

302B stainless steel powder were redrawn from
1.0-in.-0D, 0.125-in.-wail tubing to 0.187-in.-OD,
0.015-in.-wall tubing at the Superior Tube Co.
The inner and outer layers of the three-ply
composites were type 316 stainless steel. The
finished tubing and samples taken at various
~'stages in the reduction schedule have been re-
ceived and evaluated.

The first extruded tube, for which the core was
prepared by hot pressing a mixture of <325 mesh
particle size Al .05 and stainless powder mixture,
exhibited tenslle g-actures in the core after 30%
total reduction. The finished tubing had severe
fractures in the core,

The second extruded tube blank was prepared by
tamping the powder mixture (=105 +325 mesh
Al,O, in type 302B stainless steel) into the

0.40

billet can. Examination of the redrawn tubing did
not reveal any tensile fractures in the core. How-
ever, the relatively large particles of A|203 were
fractured, and they tended to form stringers that
finally resulted in longitudinal cracking of the core
as the total reduction values increased. Radio-
graphs of the finished tubing revealed the cere
fractures in tube No. 1 but did not show the
longitudinal cracks in the core of tube No. 2.

It is evident from the examinations of the re-
drawn’ tubing that the core containing the larger
Alzo3 particles was stronger than the core with
the fine Al o particle dispersion. Tamping of a
loose powdzer mixture into a billet can therefore
appears to be a satisfactory method of preparing
cores of 30 vol % Al,O, dispersed in 70 vol % of
type 302B stainless steel

The study of flow patterns in three-ply extruded
tubes containing cermet cores was continued with
the extrusion of two three-ply billets to 1Y-in.-OD,
3{‘-in.'lD tubes at 2150°F. The billet can material
was type 316 stainless steel, and the cores were
fabricated by hot pressing @ powder mixture of
type 304 stainless steel and 30 vol % Al,O,.
A 29-deg taper was machined into the ends of the
core of one billet in an effort to eliminate end
defects in the extruded tube and thus to improve
material recovery.  This taper resulted in a slight
reduction in the length of the defect.

The second billet contained a core made in three
sections to determine whether nonuniform areas

The physical and mechanical properties of
arc-melted niobium are being investigated in order
to compare this material with niobium prepared by
conventional powder-metallurgy techniques. Macro-
etching of a section of an arc-melted, cast, and
cold-worked ingot has revealed the large-grained,

‘severely distorted structure. that is usually ob-

tained through such a fabrication process. An

ottempt to cold roll a section of as-wreceived

y.in. plate was terminated after two 3% passes
when some end cracking was noticed.

The cracked ends were cut off, and the re-
maining material was annealed 1 hr ot 1100°C at @
vacuum of 2 x 10=5 mm Hg. This 0.485-in.-thick
section was then successfully cold rolled to
10-mil strip, a reduction in thickness of about
98%. The hardness increased rapidly from 160
VHN (2.5-kg load) to 190 VHN in the first few
passes, and then it increased very siowly to
206 at 98% reduction in thickness. Samples were
taken at several stages in the reduction, split
into thirds, and annealed for Y hr at 850, 1050,
and 1150°C in high vacuum, 'ﬁ'\ese samples will
be examined metallographically to determine the

roll the as-cast material proved to be unsuccessful.
A sample of the alloy was then encapsulated and
hot rolled successfully at 1050°C to a reduction
of 85%. Metallographic examination of the hot-
rolled structure revealed that the as-cast structure
had not been broken up during the rolling process.
The as«olled hardness was R 95.

P. Patriarca E. J_; Wilson .

Preliminary experiments designed to determine
the approximate weld shrinkage to be expected in
the fabrication of primary NaK pump volutes were
conducted, and the results were reported.! (The
primary NaK pumps are the pumps for circulating
NaK in the ART fuelsto-NaK heat exchange
system,) The information obtained from these
tests has now been used to successfully fabricate
three Inconel volutes, one by the metallic-arc
welding procedure and two_ by inert-arc weldmg
procedures.

The shrinkage of volute-No, 1, fabricated by

‘using the metallicearc, (coated-electrode) welding -

procedure, compared favorably with that of simu-
.lated test components, -However, radiographic
inspection of the weld revealed porosity to an
‘unacceptable degree. The exclusive use of inert-
arc welding was therefore specified for the
~ joining of future volute halves in order to ensure
~acceptable quality,

It was recognized that the magnitiude of the weld
shrinkage would differ sugmflcantly for the two

welding processes, and, since the existing data

were not adequate for predlchng the dimensional
changes, an additional shrmkage test was con-
ducted, © Two test pieces were machined from

and welded - in accordance with the procedure
described in Fig. 3.4.1. Micrometer measurements
were made at four radial sections, as described in

Fig. 3.4.2, prior to and after each subsequent_

operation. The completed test piece is shown in
Fig. 3.4.3. The results of the micrometer measure-
ments are summarized in Table 3.4.1.

These data provided a first approximation of the
shrinkage to be expected when welding of volute
Ne. 2 was undertaken. - A 0.125-in. shrinkage
allowance was incorporated into the joint design
and, after machining, the volute halves were

FABRICATION OF PRIMARY NaK
. PUMP IMPELLERS

P. Patriarca G. M. Slaughter

Four primary NaK pump impellers have been
fabricated by furnace brozing with Coast Metals
brazing alloy No. 52. Since slow heating and
cooling rates are required to minimize distortion
and braze cracking, each impeller brazing cycle
entails o furnace time of 10 to 12 hr. As can be
seen in Fig. 3.4.7, which shows a typical impeller,
the vanes were inert-arc-welded to the housing,
where accessibility permitted, to achieve ad-
ditional reinforcement,

SHRINKAGE OF INCONEL CORE
SHELL WELDS

P. Patriarca A. E. Goldman

Preliminary transverse weld shrinkage tests of
Inconel core shell welds were discussed in the
previous report.2 Further experiments have now
been conducted to study the shrinkage for other
thicknesses of plate, The procedure for the
shrinkage tests of welds of l/s-in.-_thick plates is
described below, and the results are compared
with the results obtained for other thicknesses of
Inconel plate. ,

The initial phase of the test consisted of the
inert-arc welding of two Y%-in. Inconel sheets,
each 6 x 20 in. A 50-deg bevel! with a I'Sz'i“'

sheet, The sheets were assembled as shown in
Fig. 3.4.8 and held against a flat horizontal plate
by means of C-clamps. The edges of the assembly
were sealed with tape to prevent air leakage,
since only the torch gas was used to supply

A l,é--in.-long tack weld was placed near each end
of the root, and two other z-in.-long tack welds
were equally spaced along the root. The root
pass was made, without filler metal, and, after
wire brushing and cleaning the weld with acetone,
a final pass was made for which 1,16--in. inco No. 62
filler wire was used.

A second test was made that was similar to the
first, except that backing gas was used to elimi-
nate oxidation of the underside of the weld, Neo
shrinkage measurements were taken on these

plates, since the test plates were made solely

to aid the welding operator in adapting his
technique.
Based upon the plate tests, two tests were made

~with Y%-in. Inconel sheets, each 6 x 33 ihr.,-th_af_

were bent and welded into - lO‘é-in.—dia ‘hoops.

A 50-deg bevel with a 'z'z-in. land was machined.
on one long edge of each sheet, The first hoop
- was placed ‘on the flat, horizontal bed of the
~welding" positioner, ‘and the second hoop was .
placed above it.  The two hoops were aligned by
- placing a large perforated steel band around the
“root girth and tightening the band with C-clamps,
‘as shown- in Fig. 3.4.9. Transverse micrometer
measurements were then taken at 4-in. intervals -

beads was permitted prior to deposition of the
root pass, ‘

After the tack welds were made, the steel band
was removed, micrometer measurements were
again taken, and the assembly was enclosed as

for 10 min, after which the root pass was made.
After wire brushing and cleaning the weld with
acetone, the final pass was made, with '4 -in,
Inco No. 62 filler wire again being used. Féinal
micrometer measurements were taken after the
disks were removed from the ends of the assembly.

Two additional tests were then carried out in an
identical manner with Y-in, Inconel sheets, each
6 x 70 in., bent and werded into 22-in.~dia hoops.
These hoops were aligned with C-—clamps, rather
than with a steel band, The pertinent welding
data for the four hoops are listed in Table 3.4.4,
and the micrometer measurements are given in
Table 3.4.5.

The deposited welds were clean and had slight
concavity on the inside surfaces. It was found

that short tack welds enabled the welding operator
to fuse the tack welds into the root pass more
readily. For Y-in. Inconel sheets, inert-arc-
welded under the conditions utilized in this test,
the transverse shrinkage to be expected for loz-in.
hoops is 0.050 £ 0.010 in. and, for 22«in, hoops,
0.041 £ 0.010 in. The circumferential shrinkage
was less than measurable for both hoop sizes.

A summary of the weld shrinkage results for
Y . 1/8-, V., and ¥%-in. Inconel sheet is presented
in Table 3.4.6. It should be noted that the data
are pertinent only under the conditions utilized
for these tests, Any change in the variables may
cause significant variations in the actual weld
shrinkage encountered.

A 500-kw high-conductivity-fin NdK-fo-efr-roJi-

ator, designated York HCF Radiator No, 4, was’

removed from a test stand on March 3, 1956, after
1356 hr of service. This radiator was tested in
the temperature range of 1000 to 1600°F, with a
temperature differential imposed on the system
during 748 hr of the test.

This radiator differed from radiators tested
previously in that the side plates were removed,
the horizontal spacer plates were cut, and the
base plate was sliced through the middle parallel

" to the air flow. These modifications were among
- those suggested in previous reports,3+4

contained a portion of three tubes, with each tube
joined to 15 or more fins, The specimens were
cross sectioned to expose two opposed joint
areas, mounted, and examined at 80X.

A total of 2757 joint areas were examined,
The percentages of fin-to-tube adherence and the
degree of oxidation of the fin collars were noted.

The results of this examination in comparison
with the results of examinations of five radiators
operated previously are presented in Table 3.4.7.
Small cracks were found in several of the tube-to-
support plate joints, and evidence of cracking was
observed in several tube<to-sump plate joints.
The relationship between the incidence of fracture
and the presence of support members or plates
was previously demonstrated,3+4

CONTINUOUS PRODUCTION OF SINTERED
BRAZING ALLOY RINGS

P. Patriarca R. E. Clausing

The use of sintered Coast Metals brazing alloy
No. 52 rings for the brazing of ART radiators is
dependent upon the achievement of production
rates adequate to reduce the cost per ring to a
value which con compete with the present means
.of preplacing the brazing clloy. An experimental
pilot plant has been built which has cttained a
production rate of more than 8000 rings per hour,
In ‘the first production run, 33,000 rings were
made in 5 hr, It is felt that production of this
magnitude will definitely establish a satisfactory
cost for ring production.

Graphite molds are used, as shown inFig. 3.4.14,
for the production of the brazing alloy rings. The

depth of cut in the mold is adjusted to yield rings
that weigh 4.5 g per 100 rings. The size of the
ring is based on the quantity of alloy required to
produce an acceptable tubesto-fin joint. The molds
are loaded flush with brazing alloy powder and
stacked four high, with each mold serving as a lid
for the one below it. | '
The furnace used in the pilot plant is shown
schematically in Fig. 3.4.15. This furnace is
essentially a two section unit, The first section
serves as a preheater, and the second section
adjusts the temperature to the narrow range in
which satisfactory rings are produced and main-
tains this temperature long enough to allow the
entire mass of the molds to reach this temperature.,
A continuous stainless steel ribbon conveyor belt
runs through the furnace and is driven by @ vari-
able-speed drive. When this equipment is operated

assembled into the previously metal-sprayed tube
sheet, the tubes are attached to the tube sheet
with @ small amount of metal-sprayed brazing ailoy.
A tungsten sheet is used as a mask to prevent

RELAXATION TESTING OF INCONEL
C. R. Kennedy"

The evaluation studies of the creep and creep-
rupture characteristics of metals under constant
load and in various environments have been con-
tinved, and, recently, equipment was designed and
constructed for the study of the decay, or relaxe-
tion, of stresses in metals under constant strain.
This phenomenen is time and temperature dependent

-and. assumes particular importance in cases of

thermally induced cyclic stresses, ~For example,
if a structural member is held rigidly at both ends,
and the temperature is raised and then lowered
rapidly, tensile and compressive loads will result,
It is essential in the stress analysis of this situa-
tion to know how much the stress hos decreased,
that is, relaxed, in each condition before the
reverse load is applied, '

‘There have been many different machines and
methods used by previous experimenters to de-
termine the relaxation characteristics of metals;
however, most of the work has been in temperature
ranges well below the annealing temperature of the
material tested. Extrapolation of these results
to higher temperature does not give reliable values.
Therefore it was necessary that new experimental
techniques be devised to achieve the accuracy
desired for temperatures in the range of 1200 to
1800°F. The equipment designed for the tests is
shown in Fig. 3.5.1. The test is run by setting the
extensometer for the desired strain and then applying
and automatically controlling the stress to produce
and maintain this strain. The positions of the
electric contacts are established by micrometer

"screws on a 20 to 1 magnification extensometer

furnace is shunt-wound and is controlled by a
‘Leeds & Northrup model H Speedomax recorder and

DAT 60 controller which will control to $2°F with
a temperature gradient over the 6-in. gage length of
less than 5°F,

Test results of relaxation testing of Inconel at

1300 and 1500°F are shown. in Figs. 3.5.2 and

3.5.3. To produce a plot on which all the relaxa-
tion characteristics can be shown, the first 0.1-hr
period is plotted linearly and the remaining time is
shown on a semilog plot. The initial stresses ob-

tained at both temperatures agree with the moduli
of elasticity of Inconel at the respective tempera-
tures. The plots shown in Figs, 3.5.2 and 3.5.3 are
averages of from 5 to 10 tests, and the material was
tested with varying degrees of plastic strain at the
test temperatures. This information can be used
to determine the residual stresses in structural
members which have undergone o thermal cycle.
The data can only be considered valid for thermal
cycles which produce strains within the range
investigated. ' Further testing is now in progress to
determine ihe relaxation characteristics at higher
strains and various temperatures to ‘establish a
complete understanding of the relaxation charac-
teristics of Inconel,

A ;study of the properties of europium oxide was
initiated, Physical properties, sintering charac-

teristics, and fabrication techniques will be in-

vestigated.

Numerous shapes of mckel—rare-earth oxide
cermets, Al,O0,, and CaF, are being produced,
These materials are to be used in the fabrication
of a high-temperature critical experiment to be
performed by ORNL for Pratt & Whitney Aircraft,

The production of test pieces of high- dens:ty,

high-purity beryllium oxide by hot pressing was

continued. Densities of 97 to 98% of theoretical
have been obtained, These pieces will be tested
for corrosion resistance in molten sodium, - Facili-
ties are being prepared for the fabrication of large
pieces.

A small batch of zirconium carblde was made by
the McKenna-Menstruum process.! . This material
is being processed for hot pressing. Physical

desired for use in a Calrod type of thermocouple.

HIGH-TEMPERATURE X-RAY DIFFRACTION
G. D, White
High-temperature x-ray diffraction plots were

obtained for samples of Hastelloy B at 500, 600,
and 700°C., These plots were taken to determine

~whether an inversion occurs in the vicinity of

600°C. - At all temperatures a face-centered cubic
pattern was obtained., The only difference in the
patterns at the three temperatures was a slight
shift to larger d values with increasing temperature

because of thermal expansion.

EDDY-CURRENT INSPECTION OF
SMALL.DIAMETER TUBING

J. W. Allen
The results of eddy-current inspection of 14,540 ft

of CX-900 Inconel tubing are presented in Table

3.7.1. The undersize and oversize figures include
rejections on both out-of-tolerance wall thicknesses
and out-of-tolerance diameters, since the two appear
inseparably in the cyclograph type of eddy-current

" readout.’  The discontinuity indications were due

to cracks, gouges, and the pickup of foreign metal
on the inside of the tube.
The presence of foreign metal embedded in the

. inside wall of 3/ -m.-OD 0.025-in.-wall, CX-900

Inconel tubing has been detected in recent sh:p-
ments by the encircling-coil eddy-current tesf.
Subsequent longitudinal macrosections of two such
areas that occutred in one 42-in. length of tubing
are shown in Fig. 3.7.1, along with the eddy-
current signal trace produced by this tube. The
defective areas are indicated by the sharp down-
ward spikes in the trace. The spikes are similar
to the spikes which result from short longitudinal
crocks, except that they are in the direction of
increased wall thickness rather than in the direc-
tion of decreased wall thickness. Stains of the
type shown in Fig. 3.7.1 are yellow to red in color
and are sometimes, but not always, present in the

areas that have picked up foreign metal, Trans-
verse microsections through several of the defec-
tive areas have failed to reveal that the defects
have perceptible depth.  Therefore the foreign
metal must be highly permeable to have produced
such large eddy-current indications as those shown
in Fig, 3.7.1, which suggests that the foreign metal
consists of bits of steel picked up from the mandrel

over which the tubing was drawn. Further metallo-

graphic study and microspark spectrographlc analy-
sis of these areas is planned

INSPECTION OF TUBING BY THE = -

R. W. McClung

Large quantities of tubing are now being in-
spected by the immersed ultrasonic technique.
During this quarter 4224 pieces of 9&6-in.-0D,
0.025-in.-wall, 42-in.-long, CX-900 Inconel tubing
were inspected; 4143 lengths were accepted for
critical use. The rejection rate was slightly less
than 2%, and thus it appears that hlgh-quahty
tubing is being received. All the rejected lengths
contained only very small, single defects. Attempts
to metallographically examine some of the defects
were unsuccessful because of the difficulty of
precisely marking the defect and the tendency of
the metal to smear over small defects during
polishing. Further metallographic studies are
planned.

be noted that the crack, although it is about

Again, difficulty was encountered in the preparation
of metallographic sections because the soft matrix
smeared over the defects during the polishing
operation. However, a greater degree of success
was achieved in locating the defects in this ma-
terial than in the Inconel tubing, This can probably
be attributed to the larger size of the defects that
seem to regularly occur in Hastelloy tubing,

Over 1000 ft of %-in.-OD, 0.035-in.-wali, CX-900
Inconel tubing in random lengths was examined
ultrasonically, and a total of approximately 25 ft
was rejected. The few defects detected seemed to
be very small. In general, the quality of this
tubing was quite high, as indicated by the rejection
rate of less than 2.5%. Metallographic examing-

tions also failed to disclose any defects of appre-

ciable size. Of the 229 pieces of 0.229-in.-0D,
0.025-in.=walf, 78-in.-long, CX-900 Inconet tubing
also examined ultrasonically, 31 pieces were re-
jected,

An attempt is being made to compare the de-
tection of defects by ultrasound and by other in-
spection methods, and, for the larger defects,
correlations are normally possible. However, for
many of the very small defects, particularly those
on the inside of tubing, ultrasound seems to be
the only feasible detection methed. It is hoped
that, despite the inherent difficulties, metallo-
graphic examinations will continue to provide
additional information concerning the nature of the
defects.

INSPECTION OF PIPE
Jo Ko Whi'e Ro Bo :Oliver

The pipe inspection facility was installed in
April, and about 6000 ft of pipe ranging in size
from "3’ in. IPS to 7 in. OD has been inspected;
most of this material has been Inconel. As a
result of this experience only minor changes in
the details of the inspection technique previously
described? have been made. Because of the ex-
cessive camber in large pipe and the end whip
frequently experienced in small pipe, the present

system of using the pipe as a transducer guide

appears to be the only practicel method for main-

taining alignment, In this -system a hand-held -

search-tube positioner is used with a series of
interchangeable side plates cut to fit each plpe
size. The positioner is translated along the pipe
by hand, and @ moter-driven string is used as @
speed guide (Fig. 3.7.6). The positioner (Fig. 3.7.%)

distance (delay), the rotation of the transducer in
the plane perpendicular to the sound beam, and
the angle of incidence of the beam upon the outside

surface of the pipe. The angle of incidence de-

termines the depth of inspection of the pipe wall.,
With materials of the same acoustic impedance as
Inconel and approximately the same wall-thickness-
to-diameter ratio as sched-40 pipe, the usaoble
range of angles is from 10 to 30 deg. Incident
angles of less than 10 deg cause interference

- because of reverberations across the pipe wall.

Angles greater than 30 deg set up Rayleigh (surface)
_waves3 and occentuate scraiches selectively more
than deeper defects. Within these limits the inci-
dent angles used are chosen to balance the indi-

_cations from 5% notches on the mslde and outslde

surfaces. Internal defects show up strongly when
angles of about 10 to 17 deg are used, External

,_defects show up strongest ‘when angles of about

,23 to 90 deg are used.

dtcular to the 'sound beam is sometimes necessary

because the transducers presently available do
not emit energy uniformly. Apparently, uniform
crystal damping is difficult to achieve and poorly
damped areas, or ‘‘hot spots,’”’ are common. The
purchase of a square transducer is contemplated to
minimize this “hot spot’” effect and to achieve
higher coverage per revolution and hence greater
scanning speeds.

Heretofore, experience had been limited to in-
spections made at a frequency of 5 Mc, but for
thick-walled pipe, 2.25 Mc appears to be a promis-
ing frequency, as evidenced by some recent success.
More observations will be made ot this frequency
in the near future,

It has been observed that, in general, pipe quality
has improved since the inspection program was
initiated. Several entire pipe orders were rejected

218

~ during the early stages of the inspection program.

During the lost few months the special core exer-
cised in preparing the pipe, crating it for protection
during shipment, etc., have resulted in marked
improvement in quality, as evidenced by numerous
pipe orders inspected without detection of a single
defect,

INSPECTION OF THIN SHEET

J. W, Allen R. W, McClung-
R. B. Oliver o

Sheet material has extensive application in power
reactors, and, in many cases, formed sheet will

function both as a container for fluids and as a

heat transfer medium between two fluids. Since
high heat fluxes and thermal stresses are involved,
the presence of laminar defects is very undesirable.
The problem of detecting such defects in sheet
has, currently, only one solution, which, in turn,
poses a very difficult mechanical problem. This
situation has motivated an investigation to develop
a similor and betfer inspection method. Liquid

penetrant, radiographic, and eddy-current methods .

cannot be used because of the unfavorable defect
orientation. The ultrasonic resonance method is
not an adequate approach, since it is not capable
of resolvingsmall defects and it inherently requires
slow contact scanning of the sheet. The conven-
tional pulse-echo vitrasonic inspection, even with
a pulse length as short as 1 usec, is not practical
for sections thinner than 0,20 in. The transmission-
attenuation technique is capable of detecting small
laminations in thin sections, but, since it requires
critical alignment of two transducers on opposite
sides of the sheet, it is a very difficult method to
apply to the inspection of large or nonplanar areas.

A new ultrasonic method has been proposed, and
preliminary experiments have given promising
results, The new method requires a pulse of ultra-
sound having o duration of 5 to 20 psec, with the
sound tuned to such a frequency that the sheet
thickness is an exact multiple of the half wave-
length,  With these conditions the ultrasound

reverberates, or rings, between the two sheet sur-

faces for a period of time that is several times
greater than the pulse duration, When a lamination
exists in the sheet the ringing is decreased, both
in duration and amplitude, as a function of the
area of the lamination relative to the transducer
area. To test this method, flat-bottom holes with

GCid  0o7

C
 

 

several different areas were milled into one side
of a sheet of Inconel to various depths. In experi-
ments with existing equipment most of these
reference defects were located. To properly in-
strument this test method, the reflectoscope has
been drastically altered. The pulse repetition was
increased from 60 to 500 pulses per second,

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1956

appropriate filters were added to the circuits, a
variable-sweep delay circuit was added to permit
immersed scanning, and external connections were
provided for synchronization signals. This last
chonge will permit the addition of gated alarm
circuits and various data presentation and recording
units in the near future,

material was not available, this material was re-

worked by centerless grinding in order to remove

most of the surface imperfections. A waiver was
made on the porosity, which resulted in rejection
of only large-size porosity defects,

INSPECTION OF COMPONENTS
R. L. Heest_ands =

Sixty thermal-convection loops were received,
and the welds were inspected by the dye-penetrant

‘method. Thirty-six of these loops were found to

have welds which showed numerous indications of
cracks, pinholes, and other defects. The remaining
loops were accepted for use. The defective loops
were repaired and reinspected prior to acceptance.

Thirty-eight pieces of Inconel plate ‘were in-
spected prior to shipment for fabrication into
dished heads, and then they wete re-examined for
manufacturing defects upon return. Several were
found to have numerous pits that were apparently
caused by a foreign material becoming embedded
in the surfaces during the pressing operation.
Four heads were found to have cracks running from
the edge inward, which appeared to be as deep as
Y in. These cracks are to be repaired, and the
areas will be reinspected prior to use.

Four small heat exchanger units were received
and inspected, They were found to be acceptable
for use in test operation,

.FLUORESCENT-PENETRANT INSPECTION
OF TUBING

G. Tolson

The installation of the fluorescent-penetrant
equipment to be used in the inspection of small-
diameter, thin-walled tubing was completed, Tests
are now being performed to compare the fluorescent-
penetrant with the dye-penetrant type of inspection

used heretofore. Indications are that it will be

possible to ensure higher quality tubing with the
new method because of its higher sensitivity., The

fluorescent penetrant has revealed small pinholes
“and tight laplike defects which were not dis-

cernible by the dye-penetrant method. Exploration
of some of these areas by polishing showed them
to be as deep as 0.002 in. in some cases. How-
ever, the greater sensitivity of the new method will
present some problems, initially, because ex-
perience will be required to distinguish indications
of superficial imperfections from indications of
true defects.

A full-scale model of the present ART fuel-to-

sure drop data will soon be obtained for it. The
friction characteristics of this heat exchanger have
been predicted by using the technique previously

Core Hydrodynamics

A new method for stabilizing the flow in the ART
core was studied. |t consisted of placing a number
of screens in the northern hemisphere of the core,
as shown in Fig. 4.1.2. Qualitative velocity pro-
files, which were determined by the phospho-
rescent-particle flowevisualization technique, are
shown in Fig. 4.1.3. The regions of flow sepa-
ration on the outer core shell walls, which existed
in a system without screens, apparently were
eliminated because of the local turbulence gener-
ated by the screens.

The over-all friction loss in the core was deter-
mined and is plotted in Fig. 4.1.4 in terms of a
loss coefficient and the Reynolds number, The
loss coefficient of this system was also estimated
on the basis of screen friction data available in
the literature. The two loss coefficients were in

screens would probably be replaced with perforated
plates having an equivalent pressure drop. A rough
“estimate of the amount of Inconel that might be
required for such plates in an ART core is about
7 kg. ,

Flow studies are to be started soon on a straight,
anmular core with a diverging entrance and con-
verging exit. Screens will be placed in the en-
trance. The advantage of this arrangement is that
" the screens will be in a relatively low neutron-flux
region and thus will yield less reactor poisoning
than they would in the system described above.

The mean, uncooled outer and island core shell
wall temperatures (except the island core shell wall
in the northern hemisphere) for the vaned system
were greater than those found previously for the

" swirl flow system; this results from the helical

Reynolds number for the vaned system being signif-

- icantly lower than that for the swirl system. The

temperature fluctuations of the island and outer core
shell walls in the northern hemisphere were rela-
tively lower for the vaned system than for the swirl
system; conversely, the temperature fluctuations
in the southern hemisphere were relatively larger

for the vaned system _than' for- the swirl system.
- The fluid temperature fluctuations beyond the core
‘exit were also larger for the vaned system than for

the swirl system..
~ The frequency spectrums of the temperature fluc-

tugtions for the vaned system were very similar to
the spectrums observed in the swirl system. The
‘peripheral asymmetries were greater in the vaned

"The uncooled wall temperature rises obove the
mixed mean temperature in the actual ART system,
where the radial volume heat source distribution

will be approximately a hyperbolic cosine function,

were previously shown to be greater then twice
those for a uniform power density distribution such
as that which existed in the volume heat source
experiment. Consequently, temperatures as high
as about 1850°F may occur in the vaned system if
the core shell walls are not cooled properly, Some
interpretations of the wall temperature fluctuations
in the outer core shell, island core shell, and heat
exchanger walls in the actual reactor system have
been described previously. For example, in the
event that a momentary flow stagnation exists
adjacent to the core shell wall, the fuel-Inconel
interface temperature fluctuation will be only about
one-fourth as large as the fluctuation in the tem-
perature of the fuel at some distance from the wall;
this reduction in the temperature rise -occurs be-
cause of the relatively good heat transfer for the
Inconel when the fuel is momentarily stagnant,
However, when a high-velocity turbulent eddy of
lower or higher temperature level suddenly wipes

the Inconel surface, calculations have shown that

the relative heat transfer to or from the Inconel is
then poor, and consequently the fuel-Inconel inter-
face temperatures are nearly as large as those that
would exist if the wall were insulated,

inconel for the runs ET-C, ET-D, and ET-E is note-

worthy. Whether this is to be attributed to the very
large fuel volumes and the small areas of heated
surface, to the high temperatures at the metal-fluid
interface, or to thermal cycling of this interface has
not yet been established. An experiment is now in
progress to establish a base corrosion rate for this
specific system under isothermal conditions with
interface temperatures in the range of 1600 to
1800°F. It is to be noted that both runs ET-D and
ET-E failed due to breaks in the Inconel tube at
the outlet end of the heater, immediately adjacent
to the electrode. The effect on the tube of the
constraint imposed by the electrode is not known,
Experiments are planned in which the electrode
will contact only .one-half of the tube circumference
at the electrode position. Alternative approaches
to thermal cycling experiments that eliminate the
need for electrodes are being investigated,

HEAT CAPACITY
W. D. Powers

A study was conducted to determine the influence
of fission products in a fluoride fuel mixture on the
enthalpy and heat capacity in the liquid state,
Quantities of RbF, BaF,, and LaF, were added to
a zirconium-base fuel to sumu!ate an ANP fuel
heavily laden with fission products resulting from
1000 hr of exposure to a neutron flux of 1015
neutrons/cm2.sec.  The ‘results of the measure-
ments, presented in Table 4.1.2, indicated that,
within expenmental error, the change in heat
copoclty as a result of the addition of simulated
fission products was negligible. This result had
previously been predicted on the basis of the
established heat capacity correlation expression.
The enthalpies of the fuel with the additives were
about 10 cal/g less than those of the fuel alone.
Earlier enthalpy and heat capacity measurements
on the fuel without additives are also given in
Table 4.1.2 to illustrate the reproducibility of the
data.

THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY
W. R. Gambill

A tentative correlation has been developed for
the prediction of the thermal conductivities of fused
salts and salt mixtures at their melting points,!!
For this correlation the total conductive heat trans-
mission of the fused salt is divided into the two
distinct contributions, One is the atomic or lattice
portion, which arises from the short-range atomic
or moleculor order present in liquids, in general;
and the other is the ionic portion, which arises
from a drift of ions, and subsequent energy transfer,
between atoms.

The inlet fuel line to the nose coil was found to
be full of fuel at a point 24.!/2 in, from the face of
the pump, and a shallow layer of fuel was found in

CREEP AND STRESS-CORROSION TESTS

A series of burst tests of Inconel tubing at a
stress of 2000 psi in helium has been essentially
completed out-of-pile and in the LITR at tempera-
tures of 1450, 1500, and 1550°F. The scatter of
the limited amount of data obtained at 1450 and
1550°F prevents any quantitative interpretations of
effects of irradiation at those temperatures. Ten
tests have been completed at 1500°F, however, and

(with two specimens still in test at 407 and 490 hr),
with a mean rupture time of at least 760 hr, Thus,

‘a decrease in rupture life of this thin-walled

(0.010~in.»wall, 0.191-in.-ID)} tubing appears to

have resulted from irradiation.

As was reported earlier,# the tubing stock used
gave many indications of defects during ultrasonic
nondestructive testing, but attempts to find the
indicated defects metallographically were seldom
successful, The presence of defects in the tubing
may have influenced the results of the tests in the
LITR, . Carefully inspected tubing stock of the
type to be used in ART NaK-to-air radiators has
been received for burst tests in helium and in fused
salt fuel mixtures, Additional temperature con-
trollers and pneumatic gaging equipment have been
received with which to expedite the tests.

Another test of the stress-corrosion apparatus
designed for operation in HB-3 of the LITR was
made. The fuel mixture (No. 46) NaF-ZrF ~UF,
(62,512,525 mole %) was used in an efforf to
cttain the desired maximum temperature of 1500°F,
but the highest temperature reached was only
1200°F. In order to assure a maximum temperature
of 1500°F during the next irradiation an improved
heater is to be used and the number of conductive
fins will be reduced. Improved instrumentation has
been built to record continuously the test variables
and to reduce the fission-gas hazard. Work con-
tinues on improved safety systems for the high-
pressure circuit in order to adapt the apparatus for
use in the MTR. Furnace arrangements for the

| ~ MTR irradiations are also being tested.’

Two ':fensile-c:r.eep b'ench' tests of Inconel bar
were made at 1500°F and a stress of 1500 psi in

" helium ‘that duplicated the tensile-creep test made
~in HB-3 of the MTR. Both bench specimens
~ fractured out of gage at 542 and 614 hr. Elonga-

tions in the bench tests were 1.0 and 1.9%, re-
spectively, Preliminary examination suggested
that local overheating outside the gage length had
caused premature fracture. The in-pile test showed
1.7% elongcmon ofter 760 hr. -

motor. The screw served as a shear pin to prevent
the impeller from unscrewing from the shaft, The
shaft was peened around the screw to hold it in
place, It is not known why the peening failed to
hold the screw. This method of fastening various
internal parts will be replaced by welding in future
loop fabrication,

Tests have been continued on a modified pump
for use in future loops. The modified motor and
pump assemblies are shown in Fig. 4.2.16. The
modifications include precision bearings, a shorter
and stiffer shaft, a greater clearance around the
impeller, and an enlarged pump exhaust port, An
improved radiation-resistant grease has become

available for use in future operation.

High-temperature tests of the new shaft have led
to a design in which the highest bearing-part tem-
perature will be 105°C, even when the temperature
of the shaft where it enters the fuel is as high as
950°C. These temperatures are for a stationary
shaft; the bearing temperature for a rotating shaft
will be lower because of heat transfer by the
rolling balls, The over-all shaft overhang is only
4 in., of which ]3/ in. is in the fuel, Longitudinal

- conductive heat tronsfer is suppressed by use of a

hollow shaft and the four rows of radial holes

visible in Fig. 4.2.16a. Radial heat transfer from
the shaft to the lower bearing is decreased by a
set of longitudinal grooves which reduce the area
of contact between the shaft and the lower bearing.
This distributes the heat flux more equally between
the two bearings and thus reduces the temperature
of the inner race of the lower bearing.

Bearing tests have been run in helium under
simulated conditions of temperature and heat flux
with both the new and old radiation-resistant

lubricants, The satisfactory performance obtained

under these conditions indicates that the bearing
is sufficient for the design thermal

DESIGN CALCULATIONS FOR LITR

substantially shortens the amount of analog com-

always taken as 30°C. A Reynolds number of

Some results of the calculations are summarized
in Tables 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 and in Figs. 4.2.19 and
4.2.20. = Typical profiles of the mixed-mean fuel
temperature, T,, the fuel-metal interface tempera-
ture, T,, and metal-air interface temperature, T,

‘are shown in Fig. 4.2.19, and profiles of the air
~ temperature, T, and of the heat transfer function,

y, are shown in Fig, 4.2.20. The discontinuities
that occur in the plots of T,, Ty T, end y result
from the use of two separate cooling-air streams,
Local heat flow would be expected to remove these
discontinuities in the actual loop. The very dif-
ferent shapes of T, and of T, and T, are notable.
This feature is important in analyzing experimental
data, since T, is the only quantity for which a
direct measurement can be obtained. Data on the
effect of the initial fuel temperature (T9) on other
quantities are presented in Table 4,2,1. As was
realized before, 19 AT, is very little affected by
changes in T?. It should be noted, however, that "
appreciable changes in cooling-air requirements
are associated with changes in T9 Table 4.2.2
itlustrates the effect of fuel flow rate on other
quantities, The important points to notice are the
close similarity of the values AT, and AT, ex-
cept at the lowest fuel Reynolds numbers; the

results from the fairly small heat extraction rate,
around 30 w/cm? or less. The third point is most

voltage proportional to a.y is fed from amplifier 3
to the second input of amplifier 4. The output of
amplifier 4, proportional to (a,y - x), is fed
through ‘the potentiometer ‘A’ to the input of
- amplifier 1. In analyzing Fig. 4.2.21, it should be

- noted that, in addition to performing the appropriate

mathematical operation, each amplifier inverts the
phase of the input voltage.

Scale factors for the computation were selected
such that all constants had their true values. The
scale chosen for x and y was such that 1% poison-
ing was represented by 20 v. The recorder could
~ be used with either 20 v (1%) or 100 v (5%) full-
scale settings. Real time was used throughout the
computation, The data employed were taken from
12 gybsequent modifications in
ART design being considered more or less irrele-
vant. It was assumed that the reactor had reached
xenon equilibrium under conditions specified by
selected values of A, and A , which allowed cal-
culation of x, and y, from the steady-state rela-
tions given before.12 At the start of a calculation,
either A, or A, wos assumed to change very
rapidly to a new value, and the change in x was
plotted during an interval of time up to 2 min. The
results obtained are collected in Table 4.2.3. For
each case the initial slope, —(dx/dt),, ond the
initial period, x /(dx/dt), are given, Some typical
results are plotted in Fig. 4.2.22.

Examination of Table 4.2.3 shows that the
initial period is essentially independent of A_ and
of changes in A , however large. The period de-
creases with increasing A/, whether the disturbance
is a change in A, or in Age In no case is the period
sufficiently short to cause concern for the con-
trollability of the ART. The compensating effects
of the delayed neutrons and of the negative tem-
perature coefficient of the reactor are sufficient to
overcome fluctuating behavior of xenon-removal
equipment,

riched uranium were irradiated, as solutions, for
2.375 days in hole 10 of the ORNL Graphite Reac-
tor, One solution was prepared from U, 0, the
other from fHluoride fuel composition. After allowmg
the samples to decay for ten days, radiochemical

ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

A photoneutron source was used as part of the
study of the variation of displacements with neutron
energy before the exact effectiveness of gamma

rays in displacing atoms was learned. Depending

on the energies, a neutron is 100 to 1000 times as
effective as @ gamma ray. This is a sufficient
ratio for reactor or accelerator irradiations but
not for photoneutron sources. The antimony-
beryllium source which was used produced de-
tectable effects in n-type germanium with initial
concentrations of 10'3 donors/em®, but the ratio
of gamma rays fo neutrons was on the order of
105, which made the gamma rays about 100 times
as effective as the neutrons.

EFFECTS OF RADIATION ON ELECTRONIC
COMPONENTS

J. C. Pigg C. C. Robinson!’

In the previous report!® the behavior of the
characteristic curves of transistor and semicon-
ductor diodes was compared. The emitter charac-
teristic of the tronsistor was compared with the
forward characteristic of the diode., The collector
characteristic of the transistor was compared with
the reverse characteristic of the diode. Correla-
tions were drawn between Co%? gamma irradiation
and reactor neutron effects on the characteristics
of these devices. It was noted, however, that the
barrier change resulting from Co%% gamma irradic-
tion showed properties not noted previously with
reactor irradiation,

Electrical annealing, that is, removal of charged
interstitial atoms by the strong electric field
present in the barrier, was noted. It was pointed
out that because of this effect, the bias applied
to a semiconductor component might affect the
change observed when the component was operating
in @ radiation field.

Exposures of Philco surface-barrier transistors
have been made in the ORNL Graphite Reactor,
but, thus far, attempts to measure the amplification
characteristics of these surface-barrier fransistors
under irradiation have been unsuccessful. How-
ever, the photo-emfs developed across the collector
and emitter barriers during reactor irradiation have
been measured, and ¢ series of before and after
measurements . of collector characteristics have

been made. Since a sharp barrier is desirable for
an emitter and a diffuse barrier is desirable for a
collector, it would be expected that there might be
some difference in the behavior of these barriers
in ¢ radiation field. The photo-emfs developed
across such barriers during irradiation in hole 5IN
are shown as a function of integrated dose in
Fig. 4.2.23. There is a considerable difference in
the photo-emfs observed until after the integrated
dose has reached about 1014 nvt, at whlch time

‘the barriers become comparable.

Wil

The change in collector characteristic with the
emitter circuit open, as observed after successive
irradiations, is shown in Fig. 4.2.24. As reported
previously, this behavior compares with the char-
acteristic of a diode biased in the reverse direction.
After the third exposure, the sample was allowed to
anneal for 18 hr at room temperature. The charac-
teristic taken after the 18-hr annea! showed that
the saturation current dropped back toward its
original value and that the leakage current, as
indicated by the slope of the curve, increased.

The data agree with previous observations of
annealing due to the electrostatic field of the
barrier in that the saturation current returns toward
its initial value, The change in slope or leakage
current can be considered to be due to the same
mechanism. Since the base material in this tran-
sistor is n-type and the surface of all germanium
crystals is p-type, there is a p-n junction between
the bulk material and its surface. In the case of a
p-n=p junction device, a p-type channe! occurs
along the surface through which current may flow
without crossing a barrier, as illustrated in Fig.
4.2.25. It would be expected that, as a pn-p
device was irradiated and the n-type material
changed toward p-type, the p-type surfoce layer
would become thicker and more p-type. Both
results would lower the resistance of this channel
and lower the leakage resistance. It would be
expected that an #n-p-n device, however, would
require the current to cross a barrier in going from
one n-type region to another, and thus no channel
would be present. Consequently a p-n-p unit
should be more sensitive to surface conditions
than would an n-p-n unit, )

The change in the grounded-base characterlshc
family of curves after an integrated dose of 9.96 x
1012 nvt, is shown in Fig. 4.2.26. Instecd of an
increase in the collector characteristic, there is a
decrease, and there is no detectable change in

ENGINEERING DEVELOPMENT

Engineering development work has been chiefly
concerned with demonstrations of the reliability
of freeze valves to be used in the molten salt
lines. A freeze valve of the type to be used in the
pifot plant showed no leakage in 120 pressure
tests with 20-psi N, for 20 min. This valve also
showed no leakage that could be detected with a
halide leak detector in a test with 100-psi N, and
in a test with Freon. Diometer measurements
showed slight distortion of the pipe after 99 pres-
sure tests (Table 4.3.1).

A stub for the junction of electric cable to self-
resistance-heated salt transfer lines was designed
which allows the temperature of the piping to be

that the temperature of the piping at the location
of the gaskets would be 300°C but that two 6-in.-
dia copper fins spaced 1 in. apart and silver-
soldered to the vent lines just above the vent

furnace would reduce the temperature at the gasket

location to the required 140°C,

A device for sampling the molten salt (Fig. 4.3.1)
was tested and found to be suitable for pilot plant
use., A minimum sample of 2 g was desired, and it
was found to be possible to obtain a 2.9-g sample.
The sample cup used for the tests was fabricated
of low-density graphite, and some difficulty was
experienced in removing the salt from the pores of
the graphite. A high-density-graphite sample -cup
will therefore be tested in an attempt to improve
recovery of the sample.

CHEMICAL DEVELOPMENT

A study of the decomposition of the UF («3NaF
complex at temperatures of 245°C and h|d1er has
confirmed the belief that uranium retention ort the
NaF bed will be excessive in the NoF desorption
step if the temperature and sweep gas flow rate
are not properly controlled. The retention results
from decomposition of the UF6-3NaF complex to a
complex of NaF with UF,, which is not volatile,
Maximum decomposition rotes of about 0.01, 0.09
and 0.5% per minute would be incurred at 250, 300
and 350°C, respectively, in the absence of fluorine
if all the vranium were in the form of the solid
complex UF_,.3NaF. Under optimum conditions,
UF, desorption from the NaF bed! competes favor-
ably with the decomposition effect, and the final
uranium retention is small.

The presence of fluorine appears to be essential
in inhibiting the decomposition reaction and,

appears to be insignificant, even over extended

opproximately the same as the enthalpy change of

UF from the UF ' 3NaF complex.

The decomposmon data were obtained with 4- to
9-g samples of NuF (Harshaw grcde, classified to
12-20 mesh) held in a U-tube (/ in.~dia stainless
steel tubing), through which gaseous UF, was
passed at atmospheric pressure. An oil bath was
used for manually controlling the temperature to
13°C during the course of each experiment, The
runs were terminated by removing the oil bath and
cooling the sample rapidly, The UF ¢*3NaF was
formed at the beginning by saturating the NaF at a
high UF ; flow rate, after which it was decreased to
a rate of 0,1 to 1 g/min for the remaining time, The
lengths of the runs at various temperatures were
adjusted to obtain a uranium(V) content in the
final product of 1 to 10%. The excess UF, still

_absorbed on the NaF at the end of each test was
not desorbed because of the difficulty of achieving

this without changing the uranium(V) content, The
umeunt of UF ¢*3NaF complex affected by the re-
action was determined from uranium(V) and

uranium(Vl) analyses. The temperature was not

increased to above 355°C, since at the higher
temperatures it would have been difficult to main-
tain saturation of the NaF with the UF . without

the use of a pressurized system,

In prellmmary work on the decomposition reaction

- it was determined that a uranium(V) content of 20

to 26% represented a limit which could not be

~exceeded in one cycle of saturation of the NaF

with UF at 100°C followed by heating as a closed

- system fo 350 10 400°C. Usuadlly in these runs the

Experiments ot Room Temperatute

One of the room-temperature critical assembiies

representing the reflector-moderated reactor with
circulating fuel has been reconstructed in order to
extend the earlier studies in this program.2 The
fuel region contains olternate lamince of Teflon
and enriched uranium foil. In this particular varia-
tion, assembly CA-22.2, one of the fuel end ducts
is somewhat thicker than the other to allow fUrfher
investigation of end-duct thickness as a variable,>
The array was critical with a loading of 23.4 kg
of U235 with about 0.5% excess reactivity. The
estimated critical mass of 22.5 kg is in good agree-
ment with the value® of 23.3 + 1,0 kg, which was
based on the excess reactivity observed in the
previous loading of 28.35 kg in the same geometry.

Reflector Evaluation. = The effect on reactivity
of replacing a part of the outermost layer of the
beryllium reflector with stainless steel was meas-
ured. This peripheral layer, which is approximately
cylindrical and is separated by 8/ in. of beryllium
from the outer core shell, is 2% m. thick and 19%
in. long and is centered about the mid-plane. Re-
moval of 27.3% of the beryllium in this layer gave
a 45.9¢ loss in reactivity, whereas the addition of
stainless steel increased the reactivity 16.7¢. The
beryllium is, therefore, 2.75 times more effective
than stainless steel in this region.

Reactivity Coefficients. — The reactivity co-
efficients of a number of materials of engineering
interest were evaluated at various positions along

 

10n assignment from Pratt & Whitney Aircraft.

case the value given is the change in reactivity

An etror appeared in the results of the beryllium

reactivity coefficient measurements in the compact- |

core reflector-moderated reactor experiments re-
ported previously.4 The error resulted from a
mistake in dimensioning a sample, and the cor-
rected data are shown in Fig. 4.4.3.

Experiments at Elevated Temperature

A number of design features and nuclear charac-
teristics of the circulating-fuel reflector-moderated

reactor being designed by Pratt & Whitey Aircraft -

are to be investigated in a critical experiment to
be performed at ORNL late in 1956. The equipment
and the experimental program are being prepared in
close collaboration with Pratt & Whitney Aircraft
personnel, who are fabricating most of the com-
ponents for assembly at ORNL, The experiment
will be performed at about 1300°F, and a molten
U235.enriched NaF-ZrF ,-UF , mixture will be used
as the fuel. This salt mixture will not be circu-
lated, but it will be transferred pneumatically from
the storage reservoir to the annulor fuel region.
The purposes of the experiment are fo determine
the critical uranium concentration, the effectiveness
of control materiais, and an over-all temperature
coefficient. A limited number of neutron-flux and
fission-rate distributions will be measured with
appropriate detectors.

The design of this experiment follows quite
closely that of the ART high-temperature critig:al
test performed last year and reported previously,?
although the dimensions and shape of the core

region will be somewhat different, The central -

beryllium island of the critical assembly (Fig.
4,4.4) will be a right circular cylinder (8.0-in.-dia)
enclosed in a Hastelloy X shell (8.5-|n.-OD Zmine=

assembly. The poison section of the control rod,

ture of 30% rare earth oxides (samarium and
gadolinium) and 70% nickel. The outer core shell,
also of Hastelloy X, will have an inside diameter
varying from 14.85 to 21.05 in. The wall thickness
will be 0,16 in. at the center, increasing to 0.25 in.
at the top and bottom. The bottom of the fuel
section will be flared to represent the region in the
power reactor where the fuel will be directed
radially ocutward and upward into the heat ex-
changers.

The reflector will be built up of 13 annular slabs
of beryllium with outside diameters varying from
22,5 in. at the top to 48.0 in. ot the mid-plane and
32.0 in. at the bottom. The central holes will be
‘tapered to conform approximately with the shape
of the outer core shell. The beryllium refiector,
therefore, will be slightly over 13 in. thick for @
distance of 8 in. on each side of the mid-plane and
will decrease to 3.3 in. at the top and 6.5 in. at
the bottom. To mock up the coolant passages,
832 vertical holes, 0.25 in. in diameter, will be

266

drilled through the reflector, and 125 holes, also
0.25 in. in diameter, will be drilled through the
island. The coolent which would normally occupy
these holes was not mocked up because of opera-
tional and safety considerations.

Fast-neutron leakage from the entrance and exit
ducts of the power reactor is to be reduced by
suppressing the fission rates in these regions. In
current designs, this suppression is to be accom-
plished by shielding the fuel from neutrons re-
flected by the beryllium. In the critical experiment,
shields composed of a mixture of boron. carbide
and copper will be placed in the beryllium regions
at the bottom of the reactor adjacent to both the
core shells. In similar locations at the top of the
reactor, cylindrical shelis of B19, 0.1 in. thick, in
Hastelloy X annular.containers, can be inserted
vertically to a position 6 in. below the top of the

_ beryllium.

region will be 36.7 3, and the volume of the fuel

5.1. SHIELDING THEORY

A MONTE CARLO STUDY OF THE GAMMA-RAY
ENERGY FLUX, DOSE RATE, AND BUILDUP
FACTORS IN'A LEAD-WATER SLAB
SHIELD OF FINITE THICKNESS

S. Auslender!

The gamma-ray energy flux, dose rate, and buildup
factors in a lead-water shield of finite thickness
have been calculated by a Monte Carlo method.?
The calculation included 1-, 3-, ond 6-Mev photons
incident on the slab both along a normal and at an
angle of 60 deg. {Calculations for an angle of
75Y, deg were also performed, but they are not
included here since the attenuation was quite
large in spite of the large buildup fczctor. For the
same reason the results for 1-Mev photons incident
at an angle of 60 deg were also omitted,)  The
buildup factors for energy and dose obtained in this
calculation were compared with those obtained by
the use of the moments method® for monoenergetic,
plane monodirectional sources normally . incident
upon a semi-infinite, homogeneous medium,

The thicknesses of the lead-water shield in

‘centimeters and in-mean free paths for the various

incident gamma-ray . energies . are given in Table
5.1.1, and the tissue dose equivalents for the
incident fluxes (no shield present) are given in

The results of the calculations for 1-Mev photons
are presented in Figs. 5.1.1 through 5.1.4, those

The normalized energy fluxes for the 1-, 3-, and

the normal thickness of the shield (in centimeters).
The uncollided energy flux, normalized to unity at
the initial boundary, is also plotted. The third

The various energy buildup factors as functions

sented in Figs. 5.1.2, 51.6, oand 5.1.12. Corre-
sponding dose buildup factors are given in Figs.
5. 1.4, 5.1.8, 5.1.10, 5.1.14, and 51.16, Data from
the resuvits of the moments method solutiond are
also plotted for purposes of comparison, although

it must be remembered that those calculations were
for infinite homogeneous media and are not directly
comparable to the present calculations for a finite
two-region slab. The calculations for lead do agree
reasonably well for the first few reloxation lengths
where the effects stemming from the dissimilarity
of the slabs should be least.

The dose rate and dose buildup factors resulting
from an earlier Monte Carlo calculation for 3-Mev
photons normally incident upon a one-region 8-mfp-~
thick lead shield® are also presented (Figs. 5.1.17
and 5.1.18) as an example of a case intermediate
between the Monte Corlo calculation for a two-
region finite shield oand the moments method solu-
tion for the one-region semi-infinite shield. A
comparison of the dose rate in the one-region
finite shield with the dose rate in the one-region
semi-infinite shield (calculated from buildup fac-
tors reported in ref 3) shows good agreement. The
characteristic dip near the final boundary of the
finite lead shield is apporent.

The dose buildup factors for the 3-Mev incident
photons in the two-region and one-region finite
shields (Figs. 5.1.8 end 5.1.18) are identical to
within 2 mfp of the lead-water interface. It is
apparent that at this energy and angle of incidence
the back scattering is important in lead for a
distance of about 4 em (Ap, = 2,05 em at 3 Mev).

for the finite thickness of the lead-water slab,

It can also be concluded that the back-scattered
flux at that interface is about 12% of the total flux
and about 20% of the scattered flux. The dif-
ferences for the finite and the semi-infinite one-
region shields (Fig. 5.1.18) are particlly due to
differences in the cross-section data used for the
calculations.  An extensive discussion of the
errors in the calculations from the moments method
is included in ref 3, Consistent errors may exist
that will bias the answers obtained with that
method. The Monte Carlo data is much less sub-
ject to bias thon to statistical fluctuation. (The
large fluctuation of the data in Fig. 51.9 may
indicate ‘a relatively large error, but this is stlll
probably less than 10%.)

Since the Monte Carlo calculations for the two-
region finite shield and the moments method solu-
tion for the one-region semi-infinite shield were in
general agreement, the striking differences in the
buildup factors near the lead-water interface and
near the final boundary should be enlightening, In
Figs. 5.1.2 and 5.1.4, for example, the energy and
dose buildup factors for 1-Mev photons in a finite
two-tegion shield increase sharply in water to a
valve about half way between those for semi-
infinite one-region shields of water and lead. At
this energy the finite water region is 2‘/2 mfp thick,
and, at first, the buildup increoses almost at the
same rate as it does initially in the semi-infinite
water shield. This confirms that at this energy,
which is below the minimum in the total cross
section, the uncollided radiation dominates in the
penetration of the lead, as it should.

In Figs. 51.6 and 51.8 the increase of the
buildup factors in the water is very small, since,
for the primary 3-Mev photons for both lead and
water, the major portion of the total cross section
is attributable to scattering. Hence, the difference
in the behavior of the flux in water and in lead is
due to that small portion of the flux which is
absorbed in the lead but is scattered in the water,
For 6-Mev photons (Figs. 5.1.12 and 5.1.14) the
absorption cross section of lead is no longer so
small that the absorption in it is almost negligible.
In this case the buildup factor increases rather
abruptly in the water, almost to the buildup factor
for 6'/ mfp of water calculated by using the
moments method,

It is evident from the results of the calculations
for radiation incident at 60 deg (Figs. 5.1.9, 5.1.10,

5.1.15, and 5.1,16) that the practice of using only
normal incidence data for shield designs can lead
to a poor approximation. This problem becomes
most acute when the number of meon free paths
across the shield is small or when the angular
distribution is such that a large portion of the

and oil neutron shield. In some tests a boral sheet
was inserted outside the beryllium layer to prevent
thermal neutrons  from entering the gamma-ray

summarized in Table 5,2.1. The compositions and
dimensions of all the materials except the beryl-

metallic beryllium slab is 48 x 49 x 4 in, and the
boral sheet is 48 x 48 x |n. The latter has an
average density of 2.6 g/?: ‘and contains about
20 wt % boron, or 0.66 g of boron per square centi-

The materials were placed within the oil medium
as close as possible to the Lid Tank converter
plate, The thermal-neutron fluxes quoted from the
data are equal to the neutron density times
2200 m/sec. The gamma-ray tissue dose rate
measurements were obtained with an anthracene
scintillation detector calibrated against a stand-
ardized radium source.

The gamma-ray dose rates beyond the various

configurations “are shown in Figs. 5.2.1 through
5.25. It is not yet clear to what extent these

results were influenced by the thin loyers of oil
between the slabs in the conﬁguraﬂons. Neutrons

slowed down in these oil layers may give rise to

secondary production- in the adjoining slabs of

materials, as well as in the oil itself. The average -

total thickness of these layers was 3 ¢m for each

conflguratlon, and tests to study thelr effects are

being planned. ‘ : :
Since there was' a noticeable decrease in the

 gamma-ray dose rate whenever lithium hydride was

added to the configuration immediately behind the

gamma-ray shield material, an investigation was

performed to determine how much of this reduction

could be attributed to the elimination of oil capture -

gamma rays. Measurements were taken beyond a
configuration in which there was a I-ft layer of oil
between a lead gamma-ray shield (followed by
boral) and the lithium hydride. The gamma-ray
dose rate was considerably increased (Fig. 5.2.6),

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1956

ond a curve of the difference between the two
curves should largely represent the attenuation
curve of cil capture gamma rays.

There was a strong reduction in the gamma-ray
dose rate when the depleted uranium slab was
moved to a region of relatively low neutron flux
(Fig. 5.2.5). The preliminary interpretation of this
reduction is that fissions caused by intermediate
and fast neutrons were largely eliminated by the
additional neutron shielding.

The thermal-neutron trcverses for the various

configurations are shown in Figs. 5.2.7 through
- 5.2.11, Only the traverse in oil was checked

against gold-foil measurements,  Figure 5.2.9

shows that the thermal-neutron flux is independent

of the order of the lithium hydride and lead, except
for the difference at the beginning of each traverse
caused by variations in the amount of oil trapped
between the various slabs. In Fig, 5.2.11, how-
ever, for a similar arrangement containing depleted
uranium, moving the uranium out of the intense
neutron field reduced the thermal-neutron flux.
This seems to be the result of the intermediate or

" fast fissions discussed above in connection with

the gamma-ray measurements.
Studies are being continued on configurations

similor to those reported here. In addition, fast-

neutron dose rate traverses will be made available
in a future report.

THE FISSION-PRODUCT GAMMA-RAY
ENERGY SPECTRUM

W. Zobel T. A. Love

The importance of obtaining information about
the gamma-ray energy spectrum and time decay
characteristics of the fission products of U235 as
related to circulating-fuel reactors has been re-
peatedly emphasized.'=3 The preliminary results
on the time decay characteristics (Phase | of the
experiment) were presented in a previous report,3
and equally preliminary results on the energy
spectrum (Phase |l) of these fission-product gamma
rays at different lengths of time after flssuon are
presented here.

The equipment used in the expernment has been
described elsewhere.4  Samples of enriched
vranium weighing ebout 2, 7, 15, and 32 mg, re-
spectively, were irradiated in the ORNL Graphite
Reactor for periods varying between 1 and 64 sec,
depending on the run. The weight cnd bombarding
time were chosen so that the counting rate during
a run did not exceed a manageable value. The
energy calibration of the spectrometer was carried

out in the usual manner, with Na22, Y88 qand
ThC” sources. Sources of Hg203, Cs137, Na22,.
Zn65, Cob9, and Na24, whose absolute source

strengths were determined with the aid of the
high-pressure ion chamber of the ORNL Radio-
isotopes Control Laboratory, were used for the
calibration of the efficiency of the spectrometer
as a function of photon energy. The efficiency
thus obtained “was the total effncuency “of the

spectrometer, ~rather _than the peak effu.nency,_
which is sometimes used - To. correct the data

losses for a given count rate were determined
experimentally,

The determination of the number of fissions
taking place in a sample depends on the length
of time the sample is exposed to the thermal
neutrons and the intensity of the flux. In an
experiment of this type, where the sample is moved
into and out of the flux, the bombarding times
and fluxes used in the calculations must be the
‘‘effective’ bombarding times and neutron flux.
The effective thermal-neutron flux was obtained
by exposing bare and cadmium-covered gold foils
for a nominal 32 sec at the time of each run and
computing the flux from the cadmium difference.
The effective bombarding time was computed from
the activities of gold foils, which were also
exposed for the nominal bombarding times used
in the experiment. It was found that the flux
differed from the previously used value by about
27%, Also, the bombarding times differed some-
what from the earlier ones.

The energy spectra obtained at 1.7, 6.2, ]07
40, 70, 100, 250, 700, 1000, and 1550 sec after
fission are shown in Figs. 5.3.1 and 5.3.2. They

have been separated to avoid any confusion which

‘might arise owing to the scatter of the points
‘belonging to adjacent curves. It should be pointed

out that the peaks merely represent an attempt to

‘'show some of the structure in the curves. The

error on the points has not yet been computed,
so that these peaks are not necessarily final.
They do appear on successives curves, however,
which lends some credence to their existence.
No attempt has yet been made to assign these

- peaks to specific |sotopes

An integration of the spectra in Figs. 5.3.1 and

discovered in the evaluation, were 2,92 (1£25%)

“photons per fission and 3,23 (125%) Mev per
- fission. The agreement between the two phases

is good; this is also shown in Figs. 5.3.3 and

must be remembered, however, that the source

‘ C. E. Clifford
The design of the Shield Mockup Core (SMC),’

a 5-Mw fixed-fuel reactor proposed for shielding
studies of the circulating-fuel reflector-moderated
reactor (CFRMR), has been gltered somewhat as
dictated by nuclear and shielding calculations per-
formed by the Engineering Physics Group at
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft.2: Other changes also
became necessary for engineering or ecbnomicul
reasons.

The SMC has l:een des;gned so that the leakage

fluxes, with the exception of the fission-product

radiation from the heat exchanger, will be the

..same as those from s CFRMR (PWAR-1) now

contemplated for aircraft propulsion.. The core

placed radially around the island reflector. The
shape of the plates will be such that when they
are all in position the geometry of the CFRMR
will be simulated. Numerous calculations have
been performed to compare the SMC with the
CFRMR, and each deviation from the CFRMR
design was considered. A summary of the calcu-
lations which [ed to the current SMC des;gn
(Flg. 5.4.1) is given below.

SE LECTION ‘OF CALCULATIONAL MODELS

The nonregular geometry of the CFRMR core,
which is somewhere between a sphere and o
cylinder, necessitated the use of several cy-
lindrical and - spherical calculational models to
determine the upper and lower limits of the critical
mass. The validity of the nuclear models was

checked by using them in calculations of the

critical mass of the ART high-temperature critical
experiment. As shown in Table 5.4.1, the results

of both a spherical and a eylindrical model were

in agreement with the experimental critical mass.
Both a continuous slowing-down model and a
Goertzel-Selengut slowing-down model were used
to account for the energy degradation of neutrons
in the light water used as the coolant in the core.
The agreement was good enough to permit the use
of the continuous slowing-down model for para-
metric studies to determine a design point.

CALCULATIONAL PROCEDURE

The calculational procedure first inciuded a
determination of the fuel loading for a critical
condition of a given core configuration by a

multigroup machine calculation, Parametric studies

were then carried out to match the core power
distribution and neutron-absorption distribution in

the beryllium of the SMC with those in the CFRMR.

Once these distributions were in agreement the
contributions of the various radiation sources in
both the SMC and CFRMR to the total dose in the
crew compartment were calculated,”  The SMC
configuration which gave the proper dose contri-
butions was then selected.

In the method used to determine whether the
doses from the gamma-ray sources in the SMC

and the CFRMR were matched, both reactors were

divided into 35 spherical shells, and the dose rate
from each material of each shell at a point 50 ft
from the reactor was calculated. The total contri-
bution from each material in a particular region

was then obtained by adding the dose rate from .

that material in each shell in that region, The
calculations were based on the neutron absorptions

from the critical calculations and published data®
on capture gamma rays. .In the first calculations
an average capture gamma-ray energy was assumed,
but: in later colculatlons a . capture gamma-ray
spectrum was approxlmated by using the ap-

propriate number of 2-, ;6= 7. and  9-Mev

photons indicated for a parhcu!or material.  Since
the operating temperature of the CFRMR will be
~ approximately 1300° F higher than that of the SMC,
. and ' therefore the thermal-neutron "cross section -
will be much smaller, it was necessary fo match’
‘the neutron absorptions, rather than the thermal-
neutron flux, in the beryllium and other materials

of the two reactors to obtain the proper capture
gamma-ray distribution,

The fission neutrons which contribute to the
neutron dose in the crew compartment and thus
are of concern to the shield designer are those
born at high energies. (Fast neutrons thermalized
in the core or reflector will not pass through the
boral ¢urtain outside the reflector. They con-
tribute to the dose in the crew compartment through
the capture gamma rays which they produce in the
core-reflector region.) It is assumed that if the
removal cross sections of the materials in the SMC
core are very nearly the same for fast neutrons as
the removal cross section of the fused salt fuel in
the CFRMR, that if the normalized core power
distributions are matched, and that if the regions
outside the core are correctly mocked up in the
SMC, the number and energy spectrum of neutrons
leaving the SMC shield should be the same as
those leaving the CFRMR shield.

CALCULATIONS FOR SMC CONFIGURATIONS
USING UO,-STAINLESS STEEL FUEL
ELEMENTS

It was assumed originally that the CFRMR
leakage fluxes could best be mocked up in the
SMC with UO_—_stainless steel fuel elements
cooled with D20. The results of early calcu-
tations confirmed that a better match of the core

power distribution and the neutron absorptions in

the beryllium could be obtained if D20 rather than
H O were used (Figs. 5.4.2 and 5.4.3).4 This
resulf was to be expected, since the moderation
of neutrons by D20 is closer to that of the fused

~ salts than is the moderation by H20. However,
. the use of a closed D_O system in an H,O storage
pool at the TSF or the BSF posed many handling

problems and a safety problem that could not be
It became apparent from a plot of the
critical mass of the SMC for all mixtures of D,0

~and H 0 (Flg 5.4.4) that a supercrmcal condition
--could arise almost instantaneously if H20 were

inadvertently pumped into the D,O-cooled core

‘as a result of component failure or mishandling.

It was therefore decided that H20 should be used
as the coolant in the SMC.

centimeter in the core region.

SPACE POINTS IN REFLECTOR (SPHERICAL MODEL)

Fig. 5.4.2. Neutron Absorptions in Reflector Region of an SMC Using UO,.Stainless Steel Fuel

Elements and Hzo or DZO Coolant.

Because of the excessive moderation of neutrons
in the core by H20 and the consequent reduction
of neutron absorptions in the reflector of the SMC,
it was necessary to devise some means of reducing
the amount of H,O in the core. A parametric study

~ was therefore carried out to determine the effect

of substituting aluminum (by means of wedges
between the fuel plates) for some of the H,LO. As
shown in Fig. 5.4.5, the combination which re-
sulted in a neutron absorption distribution in the
SMC reflector that most nearly matched that in
the CFRMR reflector was 25% H,O and 75%

302

aluminum in the spaces between the fuel plates.
[The calculations were for absorptions in the
beryllium, aluminum, and H20 (ref 5) in the SMC
reflector and for beryllium and sodium in the
CFRMR reflector.] The agreement for the region
near the core-reflector interface is poor, but this
difference can be minimized by adjusting the
amount of aluminum ‘in the SMC reflector.

 

5At the time these calculations were performed it was
felt that it would be necessary to cool the beryllium
with H,0. ' :

In order to further investigate the effect of

power distribution in the core was determined for -
each H o O-aluminum_ combination (see Fig. 5.4.6).

as the homogeneous fused salts in the CFRMR

‘will give a uniform uranium density. |f the uranium

only the outer regions of some of the plates

fuel density in the core will become more nearly

Fig. 5.4.6. Power Distribution in Various Core
Configurations of an SMC Using UOz-»Stuinless
Steel Fuel Elements and H,0 Coolant.

SMC using this configuration with those in the
reflector of the CFRMR also showed gocd agree-
ment.

On the basis of the above results, the first
shielding calculations, that is, the first calcu-
lations of contributions to the gamma-ray dose
by the various regions of the reactor, were per-
formed for an SMC using UQ_~stainless steel fuel
elements with a 1:1:1:2:3 fuel distribution and
H,0 as the coolant filling 25% of the voids
between the fuel plates. It immediately became
apparent that for the lower operating temperature
of the SMC the capture gamma-ray production in
the Inconel core shells was too high. Since the
shell at the core-reflector interface was the im-

portant contributor, succeeding calculations were

made for an SMC with a half-thickness Inconel
shell at that interface. The results of these
calculations are shown in Table 5.4.2 for two
different shield configurations,

The effect that the thinner shell had on the
power distribution was then calculated. As can
be seen in Fig. 5.4.8, the results were in closer
agreement with the power distribution for the
CFRMR than any of the other SMC configurations.

Fig. 5.4.7. Proéosed Uranium Loading of SMC Fuel Plates.

When ' the - neutron absorptions in the reflector
regions also corresponded (Fig. 5.4.9), it was felt
that the best configuration for an SMC using UO -

 stainless steel fuel elements had been attained.
At the same time, it was realized (Table 5.4.2)

that the capture gamma-ray dose rate from the

stainless - steel in the fuel elements was ex-
cessive, even though the first calculations were

made for a single capture- gamma-ray energy for
each element rather than for an energy spectrum.
It was then decided to convert to uranium-aluminum

fuel elements and to repeat all the calculations

) usihg the spectrum of capture gammaeray energies

previously indicated for the dose rate calculations.

'CALCULATIONS FOR SMC CONF IGURATIONS

will necessitate a thicker fuel plate design;

however, the thickness of the aluminum wedges
between the plates will be adjusted so that the

amount of H,O in the core region will remain
the same and it will continue to be referred to
as a 25% H,0-75% aluminum case.

The power distribution in an SMC configuration
using vranium-aluminum fuel elements is shown
in Fig. 5.4.10 for three different fuel distributions.
The 1:1:1:2:3 distribution again gave the best
agreement with the CFRMR. This distribution was

then used in the calculations of the neutron ab-
sorptions in the reflector region (Fig. 5.4.11). A
comparison of Fig. 5.4.11 with Fig. 5.4.9 shows
that the substitution of aluminum for stainless
steel in the core will not appreciably change the
number of neutron absorptions in the reflector.

In view of the agreement in the nuclear calcu-
lations, shielding calculations were then performed

| Neutron-Capture Gamma Rays from the Core Shells

The capture gamma rays from neutron absorptions
in the two Hastelloy X shells at the island-core
and core-reflector interfaces of the CFRMR will
be mocked up by neutron absorptions in the half-
thickness Inconel shell and the full-thickness
aluminum shell of the SMC, respectively. The
calculations indicated that the dose from the half-
thickness Inconel shell was still too high, but
from the viewpoint of fabrication it was not
- feasible to reduce the shell thickness further.

Neutron-Capture Gamma Rays from the Reflector

‘The beryllium reflector of the SMC will be
almost an exact copy of the CFRMR beryllium

reflector, but this will not ensure the proper

mockup of the gamma-ray sources in the reflector
region, since the temperature difference again
will affect the gamma-ray source through the
thermal-neutron cross section. The thermal-
neutron flux required to produce the correct number
of absorptions in the reflector will be much lower
in the SMC. As mentioned above, the flux in the
SMC beryllium and the power distribution in the
core can be adjusted by varying the amount of
moderation in the core region (see Fig. 5.4.5).
The total gamma.ray dose rate from the SMC
reflector will be adjusted by the amount and
distribution of aluminum used to mock up the
sodium coolant in the CFRMR reflector (see Figs.
5.4.9 and 5.4,11),

Gamma Reays from the Heat Exchanger Region

In the CFRMR the most important source of
gamma rays from regions outside the reflector will
be from fission-product gamma rays from the
circulating fuel in the heat exchanger. Since
the SMC will use fixed fuel the fission-product
source will not be mocked up, although the heat
exchanger region will be (that is, with Inconel,

N

NaK, and fused salts), so that the proper attenu-

ation of core radiation will be effected. Gamma -

rays resulting from neutron captures in the heat
exchanger region will be reduced to an insig-
nificant level, as far as the crew compartment
dose is concerned, by boron curtains on each side
of the heat exchanger in the CFRMR. These boron
curtains will be mocked up in the SMC.

Neutron-Capture Gamma Rays from the Pressure

Shell and Shield

Gamma rays resulting from neutron captures in
the Inconel pressure shell and the lead and water
shield will also contribute to the crew compartment
dose. The boron curtain outside the heat ex-
changer will reduce the number of capture gamma
rays from the outer Inconel shell. The relative
importance of the capture gamma-ray sources in
the lead and water is essentially a function of
the lead thickness. For the CFRMR lead shield
now contemplated the total contributicn of capture
gamma rays from the lead to the dose will be less
than 5%,

Neutron-Capture Gamma Rays from the Air
and Crew Compartment

The gamma-ray dose in the crew compartment
resulting from neutron capture in air and the crew
compartment materials is a function of the
spectrum of neutrons leaving the reactor shield.
Since this spectrum will be mocked up in the SMC
these capture gamma-ray sources should be correct.

DESIGN STATUS

At this point the nuclear calculations are con-
sidered to be final enough to allow complete
detailed design of the reactor core~reflector-island
region. When the mechanical designs are com-
pleted, final nuclear calculations will again be
made, both by Pratt & Whitney and ORNL, to
check the nuclear model with the mechanical
design.
